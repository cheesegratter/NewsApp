In January, Trump pardoned roughly 1,500 of the rioters a move that, according to Jeffries, gives Trump and his supporters \u201czero credibility\u201d to claim the mantle of law and order. \n\n\u201cDonald Trump wasn\u2019t a leader on Jan. 6. He didn\u2019t send the National Guard to stop the violent mob that was brutally beating police officers in plain view for every single American to see,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cAnd this guy, who likely withheld the National Guard he certainly didn\u2019t send them forward is lecturing the country about law and order?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a break. We\u2019re not feeling you particularly as it relates to this issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cDonald Trump and all of these minions who support him the sycophants, the extremists have zero credibility on this issue. Republicans have become the party of lawlessness and disorder.\u201d \n\nAmid the unrest in L.A., Trump over the weekend activated members of the National Guard, drawing criticisms from California officials notably Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) who said local law enforcement agencies are sufficiently equipped to handle the situation without the involvement of federal troops. Newsom announced Monday that he is suing the administration over the federal intervention.\n\n\u201cThis is a manufactured crisis,\u201d Newsom posted on X. \u201cHe is creating fear and terror to take over a state militia and violate the U.S. constitution.\u201d\n\nJeffries is standing squarely behind Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass (D), a former member of the House, who have both argued that local and state law enforcers in California have the faculties and manpower to protect both First Amendment rights and public safety. \n\n\u201cThe LAPD, the L.A. Sheriff\u2019s Department, other local law enforcement, and the California Highway Patrol, seem to have the capacity to make sure that the situation is addressed that peaceful protests are allowed to occur, and that law-breakers are held accountable,\u201d Jeffries said.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) is hammering President Trump over the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jeffries Accuses Trump of Deliberately Stirring Unrest in Los Angeles first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/local-news/jeffries-accuses-trump-of-deliberately-stirring-unrest-in-los-angeles/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Jeffries-says-Trump-\u2018intentionally-inflaming-unrest-in.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 02:08:10", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.34}, {"id": 329924758, "title": "Troops in Los Angeles", "text": "The Marines are heading to Los Angeles.

That includes offenses like blocking traffic or defacing public property.

Appearing on Fox News Monday, Cotton argued it was not the deployment of federal resources or deportation efforts that were \"provocative,\" but rather the behavior of protesters. \"It's not provocative to enforce federal law. It's not provocative to do what President Trump campaigned on,\" he said. \"What's provocative is to have all of these illegal aliens setting cars on fire while waving foreign flags \u2013 and now being joined by professional agitators from Antifa and pro-Hamas sympathizers.\" Critics have claimed President Donald Trump broke federal law by sending in some 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles without approval from California Gov.

The troops will begin deploying to L.A. as soon as Tuesday in response to clashes that began over the weekend following Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across the city. The deployed soldiers will reportedly be tasked with protecting federal buildings and employees, but will refrain from detaining rioters or performing other duties typically reserved for law enforcement. \n\nMeanwhile, California sued the Trump administration on Monday over President Donald Trump\u2019s Saturday decision to mobilize 2,000 members of the state\u2019s National Guard in response to the rioting. In a memorandum ordering the deployment, Trump said that the civil unrest in Los Angeles constituted \u201ca form of rebellion\u201d and prevented the U.S. government from enforcing the law, circumstances that, under federal statute, permit him to call in the National Guard. However, California Attorney General Rob Bonta argued the move was unlawful and in violation of California\u2019s \u201csovereign right to control\u201d the Guard. Bonta further contended that Trump needed the approval of California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the deployment, because the federal law Trump cited requires that the order \u201cbe issued through the governors of the States.\u201d \n\nRussia unleashed its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the war\u2019s start, Ukrainian officials said on Monday, killing one person near the western city of Rivne. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia\u2019s attack included 479 drones and 20 missiles, though Ukrainian air defenses thwarted the majority of the attack. Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine began exchanging prisoners of war on Monday\u2014primarily the wounded and soldiers under the age of 25\u2014though neither side provided precise numbers. Over the weekend, Russia accused Ukraine of stalling the prisoner swap, a claim which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed as baseless. \n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called on NATO nations to invest more resources in their military defense capabilities, warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin could attack a NATO country within the next five years. Specifically, he recommended that the alliance increase its spending on air and missile defense capabilities by 400 percent. \u201cFive percent is not some figure plucked from the air, it is grounded in hard facts,\u201d Rutte said from the Chatham House in London. \u201cThe fact is, we need a quantum leap in our collective defense.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump held a 40-minute phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, later telling reporters that it went \u201cvery well,\u201d and that they covered topics including Israeli hostages held in Gaza and ongoing U.S. talks with Iran over its nuclear program. During a press conference, Trump claimed that \u201cIran actually is involved\u201d in hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He also shared that Iran\u2019s terms for a prospective deal\u2014which he did not outline\u2014were \u201cjust not acceptable,\u201d and asserted that the U.S. would not allow Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment capabilities. An Iranian spokesperson said Monday that a U.S. proposal was \u201cnot acceptable,\u201d and that the Islamic Republic will present a counteroffer to the U.S. in the coming days.

Members of the Marine Corps arrived in the greater Los Angeles area Tuesday, a defense official told CBS News, after the military activated about 700 active-duty Marines Monday. The Pentagon said the Marines would \"seamlessly integrate\" with National Guard troops to protect \"federal personnel and federal property.\" There are 2,100 members of the California National Guard now on location in the greater Los Angeles area, operating in Los Angeles, Paramount and Compton.The president is expected to speak at Fort Bragg in North Carolina around 4 p.m. Hegseth is heading to the military base after testifying on Capitol Hill. \"Will be going to Fort Bragg today. Big speech, amazing crowd! See you later!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday morning. The president claimed Tuesday morning that Los Angeles would be \"would be burning to the ground right now,\" if not for his actions to federalize the National Guard. A memorandum the president signed Saturday said the troops are authorized to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and other federal law enforcement officials. He invoked Title 10, the U.S. code governing use of the armed forces, allowing the National Guard to come into L.A. in a supporting role. The estimated cost of deploying the National Guard and the Marines to the Los Angeles area for up to two months is $134 million, top Pentagon official Bryn MacDonnell told a House panel Tuesday. On Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the president and Hegseth over the decision to deploy the National Guard to the state against Newsom's wishes. Newsom argued that Title 10 \"has been invoked on its own only once before and for highly unusual circumstances not presented here.\" He pointed to the text of the U.S. code, which states that when the president calls a state's National Guard into federal service under Title 10, \"those orders 'shall be issued through the governors of the States.'\" Hegseth, Newsom maintained, \"unlawfully bypassed the Governor of California, issuing an order that by statute must go through him.\"\"At no point in the past three days has there been a rebellion or an insurrection,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Nor have these protests risen to the level of protests or riots that Los Angeles and other major cities have seen at points in the past, including in recent years.\"", "summary": "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are visiting Fort Bragg, the nation's largest military installation.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pete-hegseth-visit-fort-bragg-los-angeles-protests/", "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/02/7d0a9908-23c0-4cb9-b210-53ac5430e3b7/thumbnail/1200x630/cf54206da698563c1f5dc2ceea3d9e50/gettyimages-2212189931.jpg?v=47da7f60d670305b40b7371b438c2af0", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3819849_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-06-10 15:34:17", "author": null, "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.12}, {"id": 330014028, "title": "Donald Trump accelerates the political flames in Los Angeles | June 10 editorial cartoons", "text": "SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nPolitical Cartoons\n\nDonald Trump accelerates the political flames in Los Angeles | June 10 editorial cartoons\n\nTuesday's political cartoons include double standards, Donald Trump escalating tensions in Los Angeles, and the runaway national debt\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThe Week US \n\n10 June 2025\n\n(Image credit: Joe Heller / Copyright 2025 Hellertoon.com)\n\n(Image credit: Nick Anderson / Copyright 2025 Tribune Content Agency)\n\n(Image credit: Christopher Weyant / Copyright 2025 Cagle Cartoons, Inc.)\n\n(Image credit: John Deering / Copyright 2025 Creators Syndicate)\n\n(Image credit: Jack Ohman / Copyright 2025 Tribune Content Agency)\n\n(Image credit: Guy Parsons / Copyright 2025 Cagle Cartoons, Inc.)\n\n(Image credit: John Darkow / Copyright 2025 Cagle Cartoons, Inc.)\n\n(Image credit: Michael de Adder / Copyright 2025 Cagle Cartoons, Inc.)\n\n(Image credit: Michael Ramirez / Copyright 2025 Creators Syndicate)\n\n(Image credit: Bill Bramhall / Copyright 2025 Tribune Content Agency)\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Gavin Newsom\u2019s suggestion that their presence worsened matters.\n\nAnd he would not rule out use of an authority to deploy military forces under his control to put down disturbances if he sees fit.\n\n\u2018If there\u2019s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We\u2019ll see. But I can tell you, last night was terrible. The night before that was terrible,\u2019 Trump stated.\n\n\u2018If we didn\u2019t send in the national guard quickly, right now, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground,\u2019 Trump told reporters in an impromptu Oval Office meeting with members of his team. \n\nThe president also offered a warning, amid complaints from Trump critics that he is using the California standoff to flex authority in Democratic-run states.\n\n\u2018I can inform the rest of the country, when they do it, if they do it, they will be met with equal or greater force than we met here,\u2019 Trump said.\n\n\u2018This is the first perhaps of many or perhaps if we didn\u2019t attack this one very strongly, you would have them all over the country,\u2019 Trump said.\n\nHe spoke as he is deploying another 2,000 National Guard troops, along with 700 Marines, to LA.\n\nHe railed against people seen on video battling police during street protests that kicked off in opposition to ICE raids to pick up illegal immigrants.\n\nHe repeatedly referred to \u2018bad, sick people\u2019 and \u2018agitators\u2019 he said were paid. \n\n\u2018There are certainly areas of Los Angeles you could have called It an insurrection,\u2019 Trump said. It was terrible.\u2019\n\n\u2018These are paid troublemakers. They get money,\u2019 he said.\n\nHis word choice is relevant, in part because there is statutory authority under the Insurrection Act to use the military domestically in case of rebellion or insurrection.\n\nTrump has said there may have been one, while California authorities have said local police have the authority to put down street demonstrations and flare ups of violence. \n\n\u2018These are paid insurrectionists or agitators or troublemakers. You can call it whatever you want,\u2019 Trump said. He spoke repeatedly about people seen breaking up sidewalk concrete to use as a \u2018weapon.\u2019\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Gov. Newsom, calling him an \u2018incompetent man and an incompetent governor.\u2019\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, is considered a potential Democratic contender, and the turmoil in L.A. is a potential proxy battlefield for the two powerful figures. Newsom\u2019s state filed suit Monday against Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard without Newsom\u2019s consent. \n\nTrump said Newsom was \u2018doing a bad job\u2019 and \u2018causing a lot of death.\u2019\n\nTrump, a builder and real estate baron who still owns a sprawling property empire, returned repeatedly to the street materials that in some vandals were seen using against vehicles in downtown L.A.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s pounding the curb. This one guy\u2019s pounding the curb, breaking the curb, and handing big pieces of granite, in some cases it\u2019s granite, granite and concrete, to other people, and they\u2019re running out with it. And then we watch the other people, and they try and throw it into the face of the soldiers, throw it into the face of the police. \n\n\u2018They go up on bridges. They drop it down on the cars as the cars are moving. They\u2019re not breaking the curb because they they\u2019re doing a demolition service. They\u2019re breaking it to hand out to people as a weapon. That\u2019s bad. That\u2019s bad stuff. I\u2019ve never seen that before,\u2019 said Trump, 78.\n\n Trump\u2019s June 7 order cites Title 10 of the U.S. Code, Section 12406, which authorizes the president to deploy Guard units when the nation is facing an invasion or a \u2018rebellion or danger of rebellion\u2019 or if the president is \u2018unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\u2019\n\nBut the 1878 the Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the use of U.S. military forces from carrying out civilian law enforcement functions. \n\nIn his own public pronouncements, Trump has described the protests in LA. as an \u2018invasion\u2019 and called out \u2018violent, insurrectionist mobs.\u2019 \n\nThe LAPD has nearly 9,000 officers. Trump\u2019s weekend executive order cited \u2018credible threats of continued violence.\u2019\n\nDuring his Tuesday comments, Trump said there were certain areas of LA where \u2018you could have called it an insurrection. It was terrible.\u2019\n\nThe last time a U.S. president invoked the Insurrection Act was 1992, when George W. Bush used it to deploy troops during the Rodney King riots.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s lawsuit denies an \u2018invasion\u2019 or \u2018rebellion,\u2019 and says Trump\u2019s existing deployment violate\u2019s the 10th Amendment, which establishes states\u2019 rights.\n\nTrump revealed that he called Newsom Monday to tell him to \u2018do a better job,\u2019 he said.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump considered using the Insurrection Act in Los Angeles while&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Leaves Door Open for Potential Use of Insurrection Act in Los Angeles first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/news/trump-leaves-door-open-for-potential-use-of-insurrection-act-in-los-angeles/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-refuses-to-rule-out-invoking-the-Insurrection-Act-in.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 17:26:05", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.251}, {"id": 330044530, "title": "Marines arrive in Los Angeles under Trump orders", "text": "LOS ANGELES >> Hundreds of U.S. Marines arrived in the Los Angeles area today under orders from President Donald Trump, who has also activated 4,000 National Guard troops to quell protests in the city despite objections from California Governor Gavin Newsom and other local leaders.\n\nThe city has seen days of public outrage since the Trump administration launched a series of immigration raids on Friday. State officials said Trump\u2019s response was an overreaction to mostly peaceful demonstrations.\n\nAbout 700 Marines were in a staging area awaiting deployment to specific locations, a U.S. official said.\n\nThe Marines do not have arrest authority and will protect federal property and personnel, according to military officials. There were approximately 2,100 Guard troops in greater Los Angeles today, with more on the way, the official said.\n\nThe troop deployments are estimated to cost about $134 million, a senior Pentagon official said today. Bryn MacDonnell, who is performing comptroller duties at the Pentagon, told lawmakers the cost included travel, housing and food for troops.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told KABC that more than 100 people had been arrested on Monday but that the majority of protesters were nonviolent.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: ANYONE who vandalized Downtown or looted stores does not care about our immigrant communities,\u201d Bass later wrote on X. \u201cYou will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nTrump has justified his decision to deploy active military troops to Los Angeles by describing the protests as a violent occupation, a characterization that Newsom and Bass have said is grossly exaggerated.\n\nIn a social media post today, Trump said Los Angeles would be \u201cburning to the ground right now\u201d if he had not deployed troops to the city.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of sending troops to deliberately inflame the situation for political reasons and said the president\u2019s actions made it more difficult for local law enforcement to respond.\n\nThe protests since Friday have been largely peaceful and mostly concentrated in downtown Los Angeles. But there have been clashes, with some demonstrators throwing rocks and other objects at officers, blocking an interstate highway and setting cars ablaze.\n\nSeveral businesses were looted, including an Apple store and a CVS pharmacy. Police have responded by firing projectiles such as pepper balls, as well as flash-bang grenades and tear gas.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it arrested at least 40 people over the weekend on charges including attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail and assaulting an officer, and officials said they expected more arrests after reviewing video.\n\nRARE USE OF MILITARY\n\nTrump\u2019s Marine deployment escalated his confrontation with Newsom, who filed a lawsuit on Monday asserting that Trump\u2019s activation of Guard troops without the governor\u2019s consent was illegal. The Guard deployment was the first time in decades that a president did so without a request from a sitting governor.\n\nThe use of active military to respond to civil disturbances is extremely rare.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about public safety,\u201d Newsom wrote on X on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s about stroking a dangerous President\u2019s ego.\u201d\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reed, said he was \u201cgravely troubled\u201d by Trump\u2019s deployment of active-duty Marines.\n\n\u201cSince our nation\u2019s founding, the American people have been perfectly clear: we do not want the military conducting law enforcement on U.S. soil,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. Marines are trained for conflicts around the world \u2013 from the Middle East to Africa \u2013 and are also used for rapid deployments in case of emergencies, such as threats to U.S. embassies.\n\nIn addition to combat training, which includes weapons training, some units also learn riot and crowd control techniques.\n\nDEMONSTRATIONS AND ARRESTS\n\nThe raids are part of Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown, which Democrats and immigrant advocates have said are indiscriminately breaking up families.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged on Monday to carry out more operations to round up suspected immigration violators.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered on Monday outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles where immigrants have been held, chanting \u201cfree them all\u201d and waving Mexican and Central American flags.\n\nNational Guard forces formed a human barricade to keep people out of the building. Police dispersed the crowd using gas canisters and arrested some protesters.\n\nAt dusk, officers had running confrontations with protesters who had scattered into the Little Tokyo section of the city. Protests also sprang up in at least nine other U.S. cities on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco, according to local news reports.\n\nIn Austin, Texas, police fired less-lethal munitions and detained several people as they clashed with a crowd of several hundred protesters.\n\nReporting by Jorge Garcia, Brad Brooks, Jane Ross and Arafat Barbakh in Los Angeles and Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart in Washington; Additional reporting by Sandy Hooper, Joel Angel Juarez, Susan Heavey, Kanishka Singh, Ismail Shakil, Doina Chiacu, Steve Holland, Nandita Bose, Lizbeth D\u00edaz, No\u00e9 Torres, Alexia Garamfalvi and Dietrich Knauth.", "summary": "LOS ANGELES >> Hundreds of U.S. Marines arrived in the Los Angeles area today under orders from President Donald Trump, who has also activated 4,000 National Guard troops to quell protests in the city despite objections from California Governor Gavin Newsom and other local leaders.", "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/06/10/breaking-news/marines-arrive-in-los-angeles-under-trump-orders/", "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/web1_20250610_brk_la01.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 16:50:00", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.09}, {"id": 330049870, "title": "Opinion: Just blocks from police lines, life goes on normally in Los Angeles", "text": "On Saturday, I went to a riot and found myself at a quincea\u00f1era.\n\nI wasn\u2019t lost. I had headed to the Los Angeles County cities of Compton and Paramount to see the \u201criots and looters\u201d that Donald Trump and his administration were talking about on social media. I know those communities well. I spent years covering them for the Los Angeles Times, and I have family history on Compton\u2019s east side: My great-grandparents are interred in the neighborhood where the U.S. government said that violent unrest was taking place.\n\nBut try as I might, I couldn\u2019t find any rioting.\n\nYes, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s deputies were on Alondra Boulevard, along with some people who appeared to be federal agents. I concluded this because these days, U.S. federal agents cover their faces, don\u2019t produce identification, and won\u2019t respond even when you ask them who they are. Living in a city of actors, I do recognize their Method-style commitment to the neo-Gestapo role.\n\nThe deputies had two lines, protecting either side of the stretch of Alondra Boulevard that is home to Paramount\u2019s Home Depot. In that store\u2019s parking lot, earlier in the day, the feds had swept up Californians the U.S. government claims are undocumented immigrants. Some protestors had tried to block the arrested immigrants from being taken away.\n\nTo the east, sheriff\u2019s vehicles were confronting just a few protestors (\u201cstragglers,\u201d in the words of one deputy), pushing them back into the middle of Paramount. There was some yelling but little conflict or tension. I chatted up some protestors at a Jack in the Box.\n\nTo the west, the law enforcement lines had crossed the Rubicon \u2014 well, the L.A. River and the 710 Freeway, which separate Paramount and Compton \u2014 and used vehicles and loud blasts to push back a small group of protestors. By the time I got there, fewer than 100 people were protesting.\n\nThis being Compton, with its strong oral culture (it\u2019s famously the hometown of Kendrick Lamar and other hip-hop artists), some of the protestors were mouthy, profane, and provocative. A few were anarchists, dressed in black and wearing masks (just like the feds!). They didn\u2019t help matters by throwing things at the deputies and agents.\n\nA block west of the law enforcement line on the Compton side, a burned-out car sat in the middle of the intersection at the corner of Alondra and Atlantic. But people weren\u2019t rioting or doing the large-scale destruction we saw during the 1992 civil unrest. Maybe 400 people milled around. The foolish ones wrote \u201cFuck ICE\u201d on signs and businesses and the burned car; I say foolish because, though love can be blind, this was not the moment to pursue love-making with ICE agents. Wiser taggers went with \u201cFuera ICE,\u201d or \u201cAway ICE,\u201d since the departure of these feds would certainly make everyone safer.\n\nI walked up to the law enforcement line, wearing my press pass \u2014 and swallowed something that tasted like a mix of tear gas and pepper spray. It had been a couple decades since Los Angeles law enforcement had attacked me in this way back when I was covering immigration protests and anti-police protests for the L.A. Times. A self-described medic, who appeared to be with the anarchists, gave me a rag and some water. I retreated back to interview the larger crowd at Atlantic and Alondra.\n\nNot much was happening there, so I walked around the neighborhood. Two hundred yards in any direction, it was just another Saturday night. I could see people in and outside their homes, enjoying a cool June evening. A short walk up Atlantic, families were relaxing in the park where Richard Williams taught his daughters, Venus and Serena, to play tennis.\n\nI wandered west and then south, passing again near the law enforcement line (where the only people who seemed tense were the deputies and masked agents). Less than 200 yards from the Atlantic-Alondra intersections, I saw lights and heard rock and banda music.\n\nOutside hovered several teenage girls and their fathers. It was a party, one man told me. A quincea\u00f1era, another said.\n\n\u201cBro,\u201d said a middle-aged gentleman wearing a Dodger hat, \u201cyou OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYour eyes are kind of watery. Let me get you some water.\u201d\n\nI could see fine. I poured a little water from the cold bottle into my eyes and drank the rest. And he asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal up there?\u201d\n\nI tried to explain.\n\n\u201cTrump is an idiot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else is new?\u201d\n\nThen the father of the girl celebrating her birthday warmly greeted me and invited me in to the party.\n\nHe apologized that the party wasn\u2019t grander \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t have the money to rent a place\u201d\u2014but I told him he didn\u2019t need to. The party was quite spectacular.\n\nIt took up two side-by-side apartment building driveways that extended maybe 40 yards in from the street. The neighbors had agreed to move their cars for the night.\n\nThe father and his family had put up a white tent, with chandeliers hung from the top. More than 100 people attended. There was a dance floor, where his daughter \u2014 the birthday girl \u2014 and her girlfriends were moving around. And there was a stage where a terrific band \u2014 three guys on guitars \u2014 played so loud that you couldn\u2019t hear the helicopters overhead. They had a photo booth set-up at the entrance with a gold backdrop, like at the Oscars. There was a taco grill.\n\n\u201cPlease have some food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have too much.\u201d He ordered me two tacos al pastor. They were off the hook.\n\nWho knew civil war could be so tasty?\n\nTechnically it turned out the party was a Sweet 16, not a quincea\u00f1era, for his youngest daughter. This was his second marriage, and he wanted to go all out. He missed his older children, who had moved to Wyoming, where life is cheaper and easier.\n\nHe saw no reason to stop the party. As close as we were to the law enforcement lines, we didn\u2019t feel, there in the driveway, that the police actions outside constituted anything like what the White House was officially calling \u201ca rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government does what the government does,\u201d the father said. \u201cLife goes on.\u201d\n\nAfter a half-hour of conversation, he excused himself and took his wife out on the dance floor.\n\nSome other guests invited me to dance.

It is a pirate attack in international waters,\" Toribio told reporters. On Monday, Adalah, the rights group, said that Israel had \"no legal authority\" to take over the ship, because the group said it was in international waters and it was headed not to Israel but to the \"territorial waters of the state of Palestine.\" \"The arrest of the unarmed activists, who operated in a civilian manner to provide humanitarian aid, amounts to a serious breach of international law,\" Adalah said in a statement. Amnesty International said Israel was flouting international law with the naval raid and called on the country to release the activists immediately and unconditionally. Israel said its actions were consistent with international law. Israel viewed the ship as a publicity stunt, calling it the \"selfie yacht.\" Israeli officials said that the flotilla was bringing \"meager\" aid with what amounted to less than a truckload of goods.The Flotilla has made it clear that its repeated attempts to reach the Palestinian territory by sea with vessels carrying aid and activists are aimed as much at raising awareness of the Israeli blockade as they are about getting any food into the enclave. Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of a blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's Palestinian population.During the 20-month-long war in Gaza sparked by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, Israel has restricted and sometimes blocked all aid into the territory, including food, fuel and medicine. Experts say that policy has pushed Gaza toward famine. Israel says Hamas siphons off the aid to bolster its rule. The Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel, and saw 251 others taken hostage into Gaza, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas is still holding 55 hostages, but only about 20 are still believed to be alive.

In response, Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios launched a defamation lawsuit against Lively, her publicist Leslie Sloane, and her husband Ryan Reynolds.\n\nBaldoni also initiated legal action against The New York Times, suing them for $250 million over their explosive report on Lively\u2019s sexual harassment allegations against her former co-star, published on December 31, 2024.\n\nFollowing the announcement that a judge had thrown out Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit against Lively, Reynolds, the New York Times, Sloane, and her PR firm Vision, a source close to Lively revealed that the actress \u2018cried with relief\u2019 upon hearing of the landmark decision.\n\nThe source exclusively told DailyMail.com of the actress\u2019 reaction: \u2018Complete elation from Blake\u2019s world and a monkey off her back.\n\n\u2018Blake is breathing a sigh of relief right now and all tears are happy tears.\u2019\n\nOn Monday, the actress released a powerful statement on Instagram, hours after a judge dismissed Baldoni\u2019s case, writing about the \u2018manufactured shame that tries to break us\u2019 and her commitment to defending women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u2018Last week, I stood proudly alongside 19 organizations united in defending women\u2019s rights to speak up for their safety,\u2019 Lively wrote.\n\n\u2018Like so many others, I\u2019ve felt the pain of a retaliatory lawsuit, including the manufactured shame that tries to break us.\u2019\n\nThe Los Angeles\u2013born star continued: \u2018While the suit against me was defeated, so many don\u2019t have the resources to fight back.\u2019\n\nLively vowed that she was \u2018more resolved than ever to continue to stand for every woman\u2019s right to have a voice in protecting themselves, including their safety, their integrity, their dignity and their story.\u2019\n\nThe Gossip Girl alum wrapped up in thanking those in the public who have supported her amid the turbulent past year.\n\n\u2018With love and gratitude for the many who stood by me, many of you I know,\u2019 Lively said. \u2018Many of you I don\u2019t. But I will never stop appreciating or advocating for you.\u2019\n\nThe actress added a list of groups that had publicly supported her amid the highly-publicized Tinseltown tussle.\n\nAmong them, in alphabetical order, were the California Employment Lawyers Association, California Women\u2019s Law Center, CHILD USA, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, Equal Rights Advocates, Esperanza United, Her Justice, and Herunivercity Inc.\n\nJudge Lewis J Liman has dismissed Baldoni\u2019s suit alleging defamation and extortion on the basis that all Lively\u2019s allegations were made within privileged court papers. \n\nLiman said in the order obtained by DailyMail.com: \u2018The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged. \n\n\u2018The Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign. \n\n\u2018But the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.\n\n\u2018The Wayfarer Parties\u2019 additional claims also fail. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint must be dismissed in its entirety.\u2019\n\nThe judge ruled: \u2018The Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatized manner, what it believed to have happened. The Times had no obvious motive to favor Lively\u2019s version of events.\u2019\n\nLiman, however, did state the Wayfarer Parties will be able to file a second amended complaint by June 23, 2025 but are only able to amend the allegations \u2018relevant to the claims of tortious interference with contract and breach of implied covenant.\u2019 \n\nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Justin Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios for comment but has yet to hear back. \n\nWayfarer Studios was founded by Baldoni and billionaire businessman Steve Sarowitz in 2019. \n\nA statement obtained by DailyMail.com from Blake Lively\u2019s lawyers read: \u2018Today\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times. \n\n\u2018As we have said from day one, this \u2018$400 million\u2019 lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. \n\n\u2018We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.\u2019\n\nLiman also weighed in on the demands Lively sought on the set of It Ends With Us in order to prevent further discomfort on the set, with his opinion stating: \u2018Even if they turn out to be unneeded, an employee can insist on protections at workplace for sexual harassment without being accused of extortion. If an employer accedes, it cannot later claim to be a victim of the employee\u2019s wrongful threats.\u2019\n\nAdditionally, Liman said of the allegation that Lively threatened to not promote the film unless her cut was released, among other requests: \u2018There also is no allegation that Lively had a contractual obligation to promote the film; if not, there is no basis to assume that the value that she conveyed in terms of her willingness to promote represented anything other than a fair trade for the Wayfarer Parties\u2019 willingness to use her cut.\u2019 \n\nThe court said that although statements made by Reynolds and Sloan were \u201cextraneous\u201d or outside of the complaint, Baldoni failed to allege facts that they were made with actual malice, or that Reynolds and Sloane either knew their statements were false or acted in reckless disregard of their veracity. \n\nOne party that can breathe a sigh of relief after Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit was thrown out is Marvel Entertainment, LLC.\n\nBaldoni had subpoenaed the studio to get it to preserve any documents related to the Deadpool & Wolverine character Nicepool, which his legal team claimed was designed \u2018to mock, harass, ridicule, intimidate or bully\u2019 Baldoni. \n\nBut after throwing out Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit, Liman agreed to Marvel\u2019s request to \u2018quash the subpoena issued to Marvel from [Baldoni\u2019s] Wayfarer Parties and for a protective order prohibiting the disclosure of Marvel\u2019s confidential documents.\u2019 \n\nBaldoni\u2019s team had send a letter requesting documents be retained to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and Bob Iger, CEO of its parent company Walt Disney, on January 7. \n\nThe legal battle between Lively and Baldoni officially erupted last year after rumors of tension between the two, with the actress accusing her co-star of sexual harassment and a retaliatory smear campaign, allegations Baldoni denied.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Lively named a number of Baldoni\u2019s collaborators, including his company Wayfarer Studios, the studio\u2019s CEO and financial backer, and PR personnel Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel.\n\n\u2018I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,\u2019 Lively told The New York Times the day after she filed the complaint.\n\nBaldoni has denied the allegations brought about by Lively, while Lively, Reynolds and Sloane have denied the accusations made in litigation by Baldoni.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s team has released a website which includes private communications such as text messages that were included in court filings detailing his interactions with the Hollywood power couple over the making of the romantic drama.\n\nHe claimed in court filings they made efforts to usurp and undermine his input as the director of It Ends with Us.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s team previously said that the communications shared in court filings on the website makes things clear about the motives of both parties.\n\nThe website, which is live online at thelawsuitinfo.com, comes amid a spate of high-profile litigation between the collaborators on the film, which was a hit at the box office last August.\n\nLively filed an 80-page civil rights complaint with the California Civil Rights Department against Baldoni on December 20, before officially filing a federal lawsuit on December 31.\n\nIn her lawsuit, the Gossip Girl alum accused Baldoni of sexually harassing her in multiple ways \u2013 including body shaming her \u2013 and orchestrating a smear campaign against her to damage her reputation.\n\nBaldoni told the court the trio had concocted \u2018false accusations of sexual harassment\u2019 against him. \n\nBaldoni and his reps have said in response to the lawsuit that Lively twisted the meaning of text messages and mislead the public about their interactions while making the motion picture.\n\nOn June 3, DailyMail.com revealed Lively, 37, dropped a claim of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against Baldoni. \n\nBaldoni subsequently sued the newspaper for $250 million in a defamation claim over a December 21 story titled \u2018\u201dWe Can Bury Anyone\u201d: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine ;\u2019 the newspaper has denied the allegations.\n\nSince Lively\u2019s complaint was filed, Baldoni has faced a number of professional consequences, including a lawsuit from a former publicist ; and being dropped by the agency WME , which also reps Lively and Reynolds.\n\nWME has denied claims that Lively and Reynolds leaned on them to release Baldoni from their client roster, according to Variety.\n\nIt Ends with Us, which also starred Jenny Slate, Hasan Minhaj, Brandon Sklenar and Kevin McKidd, arrived in theaters August 9 and was a hit with audiences. The film, adapted from the 2016 Colleen Hoover novel, earned $148 million in domestic box office, and $350 million globally, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nLively broke out with the 2005 movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants opposite Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel and America Ferrera. That led to her high-profile role on the TV show Gossip Girl, which she starred on from 2007-2012, playing lead character Serena van der Woodsen.\n\nShe has also appeared in movies such as 2010\u2019s The Town, 2016\u2019s The Shallows, 2018\u2019s A Simple Favor and 2020\u2019s The Rhythm Section.\n\nPrior to It Ends with Us, Baldoni was best known for playing the role of Rafael Solano on the TV show Jane the Virgin from 2014\u20132019. He also has directed films including 2019\u2019s Five Feet Apart and 2020\u2019s Clouds, and penned the 2021 book Man Enough, which tackled misconceptions of contemporary masculinity.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBlake Lively&#8217;s emotional response to Justin Baldoni&#8217;s $400million countersuit against her being&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Blake Lively Breaks Silence After Dismissal of Justin Baldoni Lawsuit first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/news/blake-lively-breaks-silence-after-dismissal-of-justin-baldoni-lawsuit/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blake-Livelys-response-revealed-after-Justin-Baldoni-suit-tossed.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 05:28:44", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.11}, {"id": 329860444, "title": "Justin Baldoni\u2019s $400 Million Lawsuit Against Blake Lively Dismissed by Judge", "text": "On Monday, a judge in New York dismissed Justin Baldoni\u2019s $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, ruling that her allegations of sexual harassment were protected by law and not subject to legal action.\n\nVariety reports that Lively filed a lawsuit in federal court against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation.

Baldoni argued that the parties conspired to destroy his career with false allegations after Lively filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, which accused him of sexual harassment and retaliation.In her complaint, Lively said that Baldoni and the producers of \"It Ends With Us\" orchestrated a smear campaign against her after she raised concerns about on-set conditions during the film's production.Baldoni has denied the allegations.A spokesperson for Lively said in a statement to BI that the lawsuit dismissal is \"a total victory and a complete vindication\" of the actor.\"As we have said from day one, this '$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,\" said the spokesperson, who added that Lively plans to seek attorneys' fees, treble damages, and punitive damages from Baldoni and his associates.US District Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled that Lively's sexual harassment allegations in her lawsuit are legally protected speech.The judge also ruled Baldoni's allegations that Lively engaged in an extortion campaign to seize creative control of \"It Ends With Us\" from Baldoni did not qualify as civil extortion under California law.Liman says Baldoni can refile an amended suit against Lively regarding his contract breach and interference allegations.

This move increases the military presence that both local officials and Governor Gavin Newsom have expressed opposition to, with the city\u2019s police chief indicating that it complicates the logistics of managing protests effectively.\n\nThe initial deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops ordered by Trump began arriving on Sunday, coinciding with the peak of violent protests over three days. These protests were fueled by the outrage over Trump\u2019s intensified immigration law enforcement, which critics argue is disrupting migrant families.\n\nMonday\u2019s protests were notably more peaceful, as thousands gathered without incident at a City Hall rally, and hundreds demonstrated outside a federal complex. This complex includes a detention facility housing immigrants detained during recent raids across Los Angeles workplaces.\n\nTrump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

The smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.\n\nAdditional protests against immigration raids continued into the evening Monday in several other cities including San Francisco and Santa Ana, California, and Dallas and Austin, Texas.\n\nCalifornia pushes back against presence of federal troops\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters that Trump had \u201ctrampled\u201d the state\u2019s sovereignty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops,\u201d Bonta said.

In turn, this could have the effect of increasing the public\u2019s vaccine hesitancy.\n\nACIP advises the director of the CDC on which vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used; for example, recommending which groups of people ought to be vaccinated, at what doses and when. For decades, ACIP\u2019s guidance has been based on an independent, non-politicized review of the peer-reviewed scientific research as well as a debate among experts. ACIP\u2019s guidance is not binding, though CDC almost always follows it and provides recommendations to the public on what is to be included in the United States adult and childhood immunization schedules.\n\nNeither the Secretary of HHS nor the CDC director can unilaterally ban vaccines. But they can alter the CDC\u2019s messaging, fire and hire ACIP committee members and revise vaccination scheduling.\n\nMoreover, the Secretary of HHS together with heads of agencies under his oversight can pursue changes in guidance that restructure regulatory pathways for vaccine development and revise recommendations to the public on who should get vaccinated.\n\nIn a major policy shift last month, Food and Drug Administration officials proposed requiring new clinical trial research with respect to the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in healthy people under 65, including pregnant women, before issuing an updated approval for a broader population.\n\nAnd we observed a preview of the new FDA approach when the agency made an unusual decision in May to limit the approval of the nation\u2019s only non-mRNA coronavirus vaccine, Novavax\u2019s nuvaxovid, for use only in adults 65 and older or those 12 to 64 who have at least one health problem that puts them at increased risk from COVID-19. And on May 31st, Moderna won approval for its latest COVID-19 vaccine with a similar set of limits.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nDelete Every App On Your Smartphone That\u2019s On This List\n\n\u2018Sirens\u2019 Dethroned In Netflix\u2019s Top 10 List By A New Show\n\nApple Prepares To Cancel Classic MacBook Pro Models\n\nTo be indicated for a broader population, the FDA plans to require that vaccine makers conduct booster trials to demonstrate effectiveness in people under 65 or without certain risks. These trials could take a year to complete, according to a STAT report. As such, it\u2019s not something that can be accomplished prior to the autumn, even if Novavax, Pfizer, or Moderna, wished to pursue this pathway.\n\nChanges are also occurring at CDC in terms of its messaging on vaccines. While all the standard childhood and adult vaccines are still on the website, the messaging in some instances incorporates more of an \u201cinformed consent\u201d approach than a recommendation. Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any therapeutic they are prescribed.\n\nAll of the changes we\u2019re seeing shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Kennedy\u2019s vaccine-skeptic views are well-known. And while he told the podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that some vaccines \u201care probably averting more problems than they\u2019re causing,\u201d he also maintained that \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.\u201d In March, he commissioned a large-scale study to investigate debunked theories that link autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. And, amid an outbreak of measles this year that started in Texas and spread to surrounding states and cost the lives of three people, Kennedy appeared at times to downplay its severity.\n\nKennedy has also been outspoken about the existing organizational framework within his department, in which he says that with respect to vaccines there are conflicts of interest. In announcing today\u2019s purge of the entire ACIP committee, Kennedy cited the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s close relationship with government agencies and ACIP that advises them. But it\u2019s unclear what Kennedy means when current ACIP members include academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up and the owner of a family medicine practice.\n\nKennedy defends himself as merely wanting placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure and no more strict vaccine mandates. However, the vaccines he criticizes are typically subject to such clinical trials. Furthermore, arguably the mandates Kennedy opposes, which have been in place since the 1960s, have helped to contribute to a dramatic decline in childhood infectious diseases.\n\nFrom smallpox inoculations\u2014which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s\u2014to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccinations have saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring. To illustrate, mass vaccination programs with single or combination\u2014measles, mumps and rubella\u2014shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is \u201csterilizing,\u201d which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.\n\nThe American public is already increasingly vaccine-hesitant around standard childhood immunizations. This is likely to lead to more outbreaks and preventable severe illness and death. Should Kennedy appoint like-minded vaccine skeptics to the ACIP committee, that could undermine the public\u2019s trust in vaccines even further.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions", "summary": "RFK Jr. is making good on his promise to radically reshape the vaccine policy landscape as he ousts the entire CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/06/09/secretary-of-hhs-kennedy-fires-entire-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee/", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68476afc3c7d5751f84b34ab/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 00:32:16", "author": "A New Show,Joshua P.

Figuring out whether all of that would be worth it for my lifestyle and circumstances would require me to do some calculations, and I just don\u2019t know if I have that in me. (I do words, not numbers!)\n\nI have a good credit score and a couple of cards for different purposes already. I\u2019ve used credit card points I\u2019ve earned exactly one time, to pay for a few nights in a budget hotel about six years ago. In the coming years, I\u2019m hoping to use points to cover a business class fight or two, or at least the cost of an upgrade to that status. But I don\u2019t expect to become a full-on travel hacker. Flying is such a pain anyway, and I\u2019d prefer to do it as little as possible.\n\nBefore we begin, we have a great little community on Discord, where we chat about NYT Connections, the rest of the NYT games and all kinds of other stuff. Everyone who has joined has been lovely. It\u2019s a fun hangout spot, and you\u2019re more than welcome to hang out with us.\n\nDiscord is also the best way to give me any feedback about the column, especially on the rare (or not-so-rare) occasions that I mess something up. I don\u2019t look at the comments or Twitter much. You can also read my weekend editions of this column at my new newsletter, Pastimes.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nLos Angeles Protests Live Updates: Marines Could Arrive Tuesday, Reports Say\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, June 10th\n\nBaldoni Vs.

You get a new puzzle at midnight every day. You can play on the NYT\u2019s website or Games app.\n\nYou\u2019re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.\n\nThere\u2019s only one solution for each puzzle, and you\u2019ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.\n\nEach group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.\n\nSelect four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you\u2019re incorrect, you\u2019ll lose a life. If you\u2019re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you\u2019re one word away from getting it right, but you\u2019ll still need to figure out which one to swap.\n\nIf you make four mistakes, it\u2019s game over. Let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you\u2019re really struggling, today\u2019s Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it\u2019s easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.\n\nIf you have an NYT All Access or Games subscription, you can access the publication\u2019s Connections archive. This includes every previous game of Connections, so you can go back and play any of those that you have missed.\n\nAside from the first 60 games or so, you should be able to find our hints Google if you need them! Just click here and add the date of the game for which you need clues or the answers to the search query.\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Hints?\n\nScroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today\u2019s Connections groups, I\u2019ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.\n\nToday\u2019s 16 words are...\n\nFLIGHT PATH\n\nAnd the hints for today\u2019s Connections groups are:\n\n\ud83d\udfe8 Yellow group \u2014 brag\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Green group \u2014 like a crescent moon or a boomerang\n\n\ud83d\udfe6 Blue group \u2014 common morning sights for kids (and plenty of adults)\n\n\ud83d\udfea Purple group \u2014 if I could direct you to a footnote here without potentially spoiling this game, I would\n\nOne Word For Each Connections Group\n\nNeed some extra help?\n\nBe warned: we\u2019re starting to get into spoiler territory.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at one word for each group.\n\nToday\u2019s Connections word hints are\u2026\n\n\ud83d\udfe8 Yellow group \u2014 SHOW OFF\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Green group \u2014 BANANA\n\n\ud83d\udfe6 Blue group \u2014 ROOSTER\n\n\ud83d\udfea Purple group \u2014 ASTERISK\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Groups?\n\nToday\u2019s Connections groups are...\n\n\ud83d\udfe8 Yellow group \u2014 boast\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Green group \u2014 arc-shaped things\n\n\ud83d\udfe6 Blue group \u2014 cereal mascots\n\n\ud83d\udfea Purple group \u2014 ways to denote a citation\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Answers?\n\nSpoiler alert! Don\u2019t scroll any further down the page until you\u2019re ready to find out today\u2019s Connections answers.\n\nThis is your final warning!\n\nToday\u2019s Connections answers are...\n\n\ud83d\udfe8 Yellow group \u2014 boast (BLUSTER, CROW, SHOW OFF, STRUT)\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Green group \u2014 arc-shaped things (BANANA, EYEBROW, FLIGHT PATH, RAINBOW)\n\n\ud83d\udfe6 Blue group \u2014 cereal mascots (COUNT, ELVES, LEPRECHAUN, ROOSTER)\n\n\ud83d\udfea Purple group \u2014 ways to denote a citation (ASTERISK, DAGGER, NUMBER, PARENS)\n\nRight away, PARENS seemed likely to be a purple word. I just had that feeling, y\u2019know. It matched well with ASTERISK and NUMBER, so I figured that there was some kind of typography thing going on. I remembered that DAGGER is a type of text mark as well \u2013 it looks like this \u2020. So I had the purples sewn up.\n\nThe yellows were pretty straightforward, thanks to SHOW OFF. As I thought about the shape of a FLIGHT PATH, which has to factor in the curvature of the Earth, the greens jumped out at me.\n\nThat left the blues for the win. COUNT refers to Count Chocula, while Rice Krispies trio Snap, Crackle and Pop are ELVES. The LEPRECHAUN is the mascot of Lucky Charms, of course, and you may well see a ROOSTER on boxes of Kellogg's Corn Flakes.\n\nThat perfect game extends my streak to 106 wins. Here's the grid:\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it for today\u2019s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog tomorrow for hints and the solution for Thursday\u2019s game if you need them.\n\nP.S. I\u2019m gonna offer you something a little different as a recommendation today. I have seen way, way too many video game trailers over the last week as part of an annual series of showcases that all take place around the same time. This is the one I keep thinking about more than the others. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it.\n\nI don\u2019t particularly care much for boxing games (or boxing in general), but I am very much looking forward to playing Felt That: Boxing as soon as I can. It\u2019s a boxing game with puppets, and the trailer is designed to mimic the plot of an underdog sports movie.\n\nI really enjoyed this clip. Sure, the humor is a little puerile, but I\u2019ll forgive that for a project that immediately stood out from the dozens of other video games that were revealed in recent days:\n\nHave a great day! Stay hydrated! Be kind to yourself and others! Call someone you love!\n\nPlease follow my blog for more coverage of NYT Connections and other word games, and even some video game news, insights and analysis. It helps me out a lot!

To the word \"list\" \u2013 which became BRUTALIST \u2013 and to the two letter Vs in the top right-hand corner of the grid, which formed themselves into the word REVIVAL. \nI got DECO next, but that\u2019s when I hit the brakes. I spent far too long trying to form a word that began E-Q-U before taking a hint and seeing the error of my ways with BAROQUE. From here, the building was virtually complete.

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.\nIt's playable for free via the NYT Games site on desktop or mobile.\n\nNYT Connections\n\nContributor\n\nJohnny is a freelance pop culture journalist who has been writing about the internet, music, football and famous people since the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye.

Oshie announces retirement", "text": "It\u2019s in that spirit that Oshie\u2019s career will be remembered. He was a set-and-forget lineup piece for throughout his entire career, providing consistent goal-scoring and big-game ability from the second-line for both clubs he played for. \n\nOshie was seen as a special player from the onset of his career. The Blues drafted him directly out of high school, taking him in the first-round of the 2005 NHL Draft. Oshie followed that selection up with three years at the University of North Dakota, where he formed a truly legendary tandem with eventual-rival Jonathan Toews. The two were automatic in their freshman season, helping Oshie reach an impressive 24 goals and 45 points in 44 games of his first year.\n\nThe good times kept rolling through Oshie\u2019s sophomore and junior seasons in college. He chased 52 points in 43 games, then 45 points in 42 games, in his final two seasons \u2014 while supporting North Dakota to the Frozen Four in all three seasons. The Fightning Sioux never got over the hump, but Oshie\u2019s performances were enough to ramp him directly into the NHL in the 2008-09 season.\n\nHe entered the league on bumpy ground \u2014 and struggled to find his footing early on after dominating high school and college. That was exacerbated by a pair of ankle injuries early into his career, holding him to just 12 games in the first half of his rookie season. But Oshie shot back to form once he returned to full health, and proceeded to stamp his place in the Blues\u2019 lineup with 35 points in 45 games through the year\u2019s second half. That\u2019s a 64-point scoring pace \u2014 a staggering number for a rookie coming off injury.\n\nThe statement first year was enough to earn Oshie a top-six role in the 2009-10 season \u2014 and a bid of health gave him a chance to show what he could do. He finished the year with 18 goals and 48 points in 76 games, and ranked second on the team in total hits (149) behind prominent bruiser David Backes (266). In Year 3, his role shifted back to that of a play-driving scorer \u2014 and he posted 34 points in 49 games while battling through injuries once again.\n\nWith three years under his belt, Oshie\u2019s impact became clear. He was a feisty, hard-working winger at the NHL level who sought out flashy dekes, gritty goals, and big open-ice hits \u2026 even when the latter resulted in repeat injuries. It was an, again, unwavering style that beautifully complimented the heft of Backes and the skill of David Perron or Jaden Schwartz. Oshie ranked in the top-three of St. Louis\u2019 scoring in three of his six years with the club, even despite missing 131 combined games due to injury.\n\nBut eyeing a lineup more geared towards hits along the boards than flashy plays in the middle, St. Louis opted to trade Oshie to the Capitals for Troy Brouwer, Pheonix Copley and the draft pick used to select Garrett Pilon in 2015. Brouwer would manage some electric moments in St. Louis, but his performances all fell short of the routine 50-point seasons Oshie provided the Capitals. He managed one of his many career-defining performances in the 2016-17 season \u2014 his second with the Capitals. Oshie scored a career-high 33 goals that year en route to 56 points in 68 games. He kept it up in the summer, netting 12 points in 13 games of Washington\u2019s postseason.\n\nThe Capitals fell short that year, but Oshie\u2019s energy on the wing seemed to give the club an extra oomph. He returned with 18 goals and 47 points in the 2017-18 regular season, then became one of the team\u2019s top players during the 2018 postseason run. His 21 points in 24 games ranked fourth on the Capitals in playoff scoring behind Evgeny Kuznetsov, Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom. It was the consistent gut-punch offense of that quartet, and the stout goaltending of Braden Holtby, that launched the Capitals to the first Stanley Cup win in franchise history.\n\nOshie continued to provide his routine impact \u2014 scoring on pace for north of 20 goals and 40 to 50 points \u2014 through the rest of his NHL career.\n\nHe was also a focal piece of Team USA at the 2009 and 2010 World Championships and 2017 World Championship. But his most notable international performance came at the 2014 Olympic Games. \n\nOshie potted four points in six games across the full tournament, but cemented a legacy performance in USA\u2019s final group stage game against the host-country Team Russia. The two clubs went through regulation and overtime unable to break a 2-2 tie game. International rules pushed the game into a standard shootout, with one exception \u2014 there was no limit on how many times a single player could shoot.\n\nWith that knowledge, USA head coach Dan Bylsma opted to give Oshie\u2019s lightning hands as many opportunities as he could. The winger took five of the USA\u2019s eight shootout attempts, and beat goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky on four of them.", "summary": "Washington Capitals forward T.J.

Oshie Announces Retirement", "text": "After 16 years in the NHL, T.J. Oshie announced his retirement Monday afternoon. Fittingly, it\u2019s the same day that seven years ago, he hoisted the Stanley Cup with his teammates, the Washington Capitals. T.J. Oshie\u2019s career is littered with experiences and moments he won\u2019t soon forget. From the contract Oshie signed after being drafted 24th overall in 2005, his first NHL game on October 10, 2008, to his trade to the Washington Capitals in 2015, and his last game on April 28, 2024. \n\n\u201cAfter 17 unforgettable years in the NHL, I\u2019ve decided to retire,\u201d said T.J. Oshie. \u201cI would like to thank the Washington Capitals and the St. Louis Blues for giving me the opportunity to play the game I love, all of my teammates who battled with me every night, my coaches who challenged me to be better every day, and the athletic trainers and equipment staff who got me ready to play. I also want to thank the fans your energy and passion made every game memorable, and it was an honour to play in front of you.\u201d\n\nOshie began playing hockey as a child in his home state of Washington. During his high school years, the Oshie family relocated to Minnesota, where his career started to take off. During his Senior year of High School in 2005, T.J. would enter the NHL draft, where he would be picked by the St. Louis Blues 24th overall. Oshie would choose to continue his education, gaining more experience in the NCAA with the University of North Dakota. During his time with UND, Oshie would set a school record and be named to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association All-Rookie team. Oshie saw 128 games with 59 goals, 83 assists, and 142 points. \n\nEntering the NHL\n\nOnce Oshie was ready, he debuted with the St. Louis Blues in 2008, playing 443 games in his seven seasons there. Oshie would accumulate 110 goals, 200 assists, and 310 points while on the Blues. In 2013, the Blues organization selected Oshie as an Alternate Captain. Oshie wore the \u201cA\u201d until he was traded to the Washington Capitals. \n\nIn 2015, Oshie joined what would be his last NHL team. Oshie was part of the trade by St. Louis for Troy Brouwer, Pheonix Copley, and Washington\u2019s 3rd round pick. Showing his ability to lead during his first year in Washington, Oshie would wear the \u201cA\u201d for one more season. The following year, he would pass on the torch, only to be awarded the \u201cA\u201d in the 2021-22 season. Oshie would wear the A until the end of his career.\n\nPlaying over 567 games with the Capitals put Oshie in the history books as the ninth-most point holder with 385. With 193 goals accumulated during this time, 76 of those power-play goals ranked Oshie with the fifth-most in franchise history. Oshies\u2019 assistance would closely follow his Goals at 192. Oshie would be immortalized with the Capitals as part of the team that won the 2016 Presidents Trophy. Followed by NHL immortality by winning the Stanley Cup in 2018. During his last few seasons, Oshie began to experience back issues after sustaining game-related injuries. As little things added up, it was decided that it was best for Oshie to go on the LTIR.\n\nOshie\u2019s Heart\n\nOshie\u2019s impact extends beyond the ice. The contributions to the hockey community go beyond his local hockey community. Oshie has always been one to give to charities or spend time supporting causes that are close to his heart. His involvement with several Alzheimer\u2019s initiatives that fundraise, educate, and raise awareness is particularly noteworthy. T.J.\u2019s father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2014 and passed in May of 2021. After his father\u2019s passing, Oshie returned to the ice and scored a hat trick in the first game back, a powerful tribute to his father\u2019s memory. Oshie\u2019s commitment to giving back to the hockey community is evident in his regular donations to Warroad Hockey Co and youth hockey programs in Warroad, Minnesota. \n\nThe Oshies plan to stay local to the Capitals, and with that, fans hope to see him in a coaching or staff capacity in the future.", "summary": "After 16 years in the NHL, T.J.

The United States lost in the bronze medal game, but Oshie\u2019s heroics were the standout moment of the tournament.\n\nGetting away from his international play, Oshie was a consistent top-six player back in the NHL. The 2005 first-round pick made his debut with the St. Louis Blues in 2008\u201309, a season in which he accumulated 39 points in 57 games. At a rate of 56 points per 82 games, he kept that exact pace throughout his career, despite playing until age 37.\n\nOshie spent seven seasons with the Blues and put up 310 points (110 goals, 200 assists) in 443 games, along with a plus-71 rating. He went to the playoffs semi-regularly\u2014five times\u2014but failed to reach the Western Conference Final. After establishing himself as a fan favorite in St. Louis, he was dealt to the Capitals for a package centered around fellow winger Troy Brouwer.\n\nIn Washington, Oshie was the same player but was able to build a strong playoff r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He had just nine points in 30 postseason contests as a Blue, yet hit the double-digit point mark in three consecutive runs with the Capitals. The peak of which came in 2018, where he had 21 points in 24 games en route to D.C.\u2019s first Stanley Cup championship. He had a team-leading six power-play goals.\n\nOshie\u2019s time in Washington wasn\u2019t just playoff excellence, though. Across 567 regular-season games, he had 385 points (192 goals, 193 assists) and a plus-16 rating.\n\nWith the United States, Blues, and Capitals, Oshie had a memorable impact. He retired as one of 404 players to dress in 1,000 games.", "summary": "On June 9, 2025, an injury-stricken T.J. Oshie announced his retirement.

Another first-class move by them to have my retirement here, invite all the people out. It really made this day special.\u201d\n\nThe announcement had been expected for quite some time, with Oshie\u2019s contract expiring. The 38-year-old did not play this past season because of a nagging back injury that sidelined him off and on, going on long-term injured reserve instead.\n\nOshie said in the spring of 2024 he would only return to the Capitals if he found a permanent solution or fix to the issue. His final game was at home on April 28 last year against the New York Rangers, a 4-2 loss in the first round that eliminated Washington in a sweep.\n\n\u201cI was fully prepared that could be my last game: I got the pictures taken of me taking off the skates to prove it,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought too much about (the end), honestly, besides that moment. Even before that moment, knowing how tough it was on really the whole team with me, what I was going through, actually saying the words out loud at the podium with my family in front of me and the Caps organization, my teammates, all my close friends, it was emotional.\u201d\n\nTaken 24th in the 2005 draft by St. Louis, Oshie played 1,116 regular-season and playoff games in the league with the Blues and Capitals since making his debut in 2008. He had 336 goals and 428 assists for 764 points, including 21 points during Washington\u2019s Cup run.\n\nOshie made an international name for himself at the Olympics, earning the nickname \u201cT.J. Sochi\u201d for going 4 for 6 in shootout attempts against Sergei Bobrovsky during the U.S.-Russia preliminary round game in that tournament.\n\nU.S. Olympic coach Dan Bylsma figured one game would go to a shootout, hence the choice of bringing Oshie. Bylsma kept going back to him over and over.\n\n\u201cT.J. had been on fire that season in the shootout, and with the scouting report on Bobrovsky we felt T.J. would have a great chance against him,\u201d Bylsma told The Associated Press by text message Monday. \u201cEven when he didn't score, he had beaten Bob with his move, so we kept rolling with him.\u201d\n\nIn the NHL, his biggest impact came after he was traded from the Blues to the Capitals in 2015. Oshie took on an immediate leadership role as a key addition to the core of Alex Ovechkin, Backstrom and Carlson, helping the team make the playoffs in eight of his nine seasons in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to give credit to my teammates, because without them, I was nowhere near good enough to do it without a group like that,\u201d Oshie said.\n\nOshie\u2019s 76 power-play goals in D.C. are the fifth most in franchise history. He scored 49 times in the shootout, tied for third all time since it was implemented in 2005.\n\n\u201cI like to think that when I was playing, that I was playing for my teammates, for my coaches, for my family, for my fans.

Six players -- three on each side -- received misconduct penalties out of the 35 total penalties recorded.

Rodrigues then slid a pass to Verhaeghe inside the left circle. The Panthers forward pulled the puck back before unleashing a sizzler between the upper left corner of the net and Skinner's right shoulder.\n\nThe Oilers cut into the deficit when forward Corey Perry scored off a power play 1:40 into the second period, but the Panthers answered 1:20 later, with Reinhart beating Skinner for a 3-1 edge.\n\nThe Oilers, who held a shot advantage for the majority of the night, then lost their composure, triggering scrums and drawing repeated penalties over the final two periods.\n\nLuostarinen fed the puck to Bennett for a breakaway less than 4:30 later. Bennett delivered two crushing hits before pealing back and ripping up the ice. He pulled in the Luostarinen feed, swapping the puck between his backhand and forehand and eventually shoveled a shot by Skinner.\n\nDefenseman Aaron Ekblad beat Skinner for a fifth Panthers score off a power play 3:27 into the third period. The Oilers pulled Skinner after that goal and replaced him with Calvin Pickard.\n\nRodrigues beat Pickard for the Panthers' third power-play score about four minutes later.\n\nThe Oilers outshot the Panthers 33-31, but logged a dozen giveaways, compared to seven for their foes.\n\nThe Panthers (2-1) will host the Oilers (1-2) in Game 4 at 8 p.m. EDT Thursday at Amerant Bank Arena.

This included many major games such as \u201cFortnite\u201d and the upcoming \u201cGrand Theft Auto VI.\u201d \n\nAmong the final sticking points resolved this past month were rules that would allow performers who had given their consent for digital replicas based on their likeness, voice and performance to withdraw that consent in the event of a strike so that the replicas could not be used to complete struck work. \n\nThe companies also agreed to remove the clause offering to pay a flat rate to performers \u2014 at least six times the pertinent minimum wage \u2014 for three years of unlimited use of a digital replica. SAG-AFTRA said such a rate would undermine the ability of their members to make a living as performers as any performance with enough required material to make a digital replica viable would offer more money if the performer did the job themselves. \n\n\u201cOur video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world\u2019s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game,\u201d SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement Monday night.\n\n\u201cEveryone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike. Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers\u2019 livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains. Thank you, Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Chair Sarah Elmaleh and Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez for your hard work and advocacy in pursuit of this contract,\u201d the guild\u2019s National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said.\n\nmore to come\u2026", "summary": "The guild's national board will now review the proposed agreement\n\n\nThe post SAG-AFTRA, Video Game Companies Reach Tentative Deal to End Strike appeared first on TheWrap.", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/sag-aftra-video-game-companies-reach-tentative-deal-to-end-strike/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sag-aftra-logo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 04:15:39", "author": "Jeremy Fuster", "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.019}, {"id": 329789856, "title": "SAG-AFTRA and Video Game Companies Reach Tentative New Deal, Strike End In Sight", "text": "The video game actors\u2019 strike may soon come to an end.

The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the game companies came to a resolution on Monday, more than two years after their previous agreement covering interactive media expired. The deal is subject to review and approval by the SAG-AFTRA National Board and ratification by the membership in the coming weeks, the union said. Specific terms of the deal were not immediately available. Terms of a strike suspension agreement are expected to be finalized with employers soon, the union said. Until then, though, SAG-AFTRA members will remain on strike. SAG-AFTRA members must vote on whether to ratify the new contract, which covers roughly 2,600 performers doing voice-acting, performance- and motion-capture work in the video game industry. Since fall 2022, video game performers have been fighting for a new contract containing AI protections, wage increases to keep up with inflation, more rest periods and medical attention for hazardous jobs. Game actors went on strike in late July after contract talks broke down over AI. Throughout the walkout, performers demanded a deal that would require video game producers to obtain informed consent before replicating their voices, likenesses or movements with AI. During the first few months of the strike, SAG-AFTRA reached numerous side deals with individual game companies that agreed to follow the union's AI rules in exchange for a strike pardon. By Nov. 18, the labor organization announced that it had made AI pacts with the developers of 130 different video games. \u201cThe sheer volume of companies that have signed SAG-AFTRA agreements demonstrates how reasonable those protections are,\u201d Sarah Elmaleh, chair of the union's video game negotiating committee, said in a statement in September. While some companies earned the union's approval, others felt its wrath. Halfway through October, SAG-AFTRA added the popular computer game \"League of Legends\" to its list of struck titles in an effort to punish audio company Formosa Interactive for allegedly violating terms of the walkout. SAG-AFTRA also filed an unfair labor practice charge against Formosa, which provides voice-over services to \u201cLeague of Legends,\u201d according to the union. Formosa denied SAG-AFTRA's allegations. The biggest sticking point for actors under the umbrella of AI involved on-camera performers, whose job is often to disappear into the characters they are bringing to life. They expressed concerns that the companies' AI proposal would leave them defenseless against the technology. The game companies argued that their AI proposal already contained robust protections that would require employers to seek prior consent and pay actors fairly when cloning their performances. \u201cAll performers need AI protections,\u201d said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, in an interview with The Times months ago. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at risk, and it\u2019s not OK to carve out a set of performers and leave them out of AI protections.\u201d This work stoppage marked SAG-AFTRA's second video game strike in less than a decade and second overall strike in roughly a year. While the walkout persisted, video game performers weren't allowed to provide any services \u2014 such as acting, singing, stunts, motion capture, background and stand-in work \u2014 to struck games. Union actors were also barred from promoting any struck projects via social media, interviews, conventions, festivals, award shows, podcast appearances and other platforms. AI was also a major sticking point during the film and TV actors' strike of 2023. That walkout culminated in a contract mandating that producers obtain consent from and compensate performers when using their digital replica.", "summary": "SAG-AFTRA and the video game companies have reached a tentative contract deal, potentially ending a strike by video game actors over artificial intelligence.", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-06-09/video-game-strike-over-sag-aftra-deal", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a20fb08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fab%2Fba%2F578cb4624d6abc43ed652eb305da%2F1469256-fi-video-game-", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 05:40:02", "author": "Christi Carras", "authors": ["Christi Carras"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.328}]}, {"news": [{"id": 329753538, "title": "Renowned \u201cDay of the Jackal\u201d Author Frederick Forsyth Passes Away at 86", "text": "Share this @internewscast.comFacebookXRedditPinterestFrederick Forsyth, renowned British writer known for thrillers like The Day of the Jackal, has passed away at 86 following a brief illness, his literary agent confirmed.\n\nJonathan Lloyd, his agent, said Forsyth died at home early on Monday surrounded by his family.\n\n\u201cWe mourn the passing of one of the world\u2019s greatest thriller writers,\u201d Lloyd said.\n\nFamous thriller writer Frederick Forsyth has died aged 86.

Biles then seemed to adjust her earlier take on transgender athletes in women's sports. \"These are sensitive, complicated issues that I truly don\u2019t have the answers or solutions to, but I believe it starts with empathy and respect. I was not advocating for policies that compromise fairness in women\u2019s sports,\" Biles wrote. \"My objection is to be singling out children for public scrutiny in ways that feel personal and harmful.

On Friday, Biles tweeted at Gaines, saying that the former Kentucky swimmer is \"truly sick\" for trying to protect women's sports from the invasion of biological males. Biles then \"body-shamed\" Gaines and said, essentially, that Gaines looks like a man. The post is admirable, whether it was written entirely by Biles or massaged by a PR team. Biles also brought up a very fair point that many of us at OutKick have said: it's not the fault of the kids who believe they are \"transgender\" for competing in girls' sports. They are children, many of them very confused and misled by the adults in their lives, and they are just following the rules that are in place. Even though President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ban males from women's sports, several states have elected to defy the order and kept rules in place that allow males to compete on sports teams that align with their \"gender identity.\" While that's a reality and biology-denying position to take, it's incumbent on the policymakers to rectify their disastrous decisions and not up to the children to solve the problems. Unfortunately, they've been put in a terrible position and Biles is right to point out that we adults should have empathy for their situations. Biles is also right to point out that fairness is a cornerstone of athletic competition, something that she should understand as well as anyone. Fairness should not be sacrificed at the altar of \"gender ideology.\" It's not fair for males to compete in girls' and women's sports.

Hegseth has deployed about 700 active-duty Marines to assist more than 4,100 National Guard troops in protecting federal buildings and personnel. But there are questions about what the troops will have to do and how much it will all cost.\n\nUnder the Posse Comitatus Act, troops are prohibited from policing U.S. citizens on American soil. Invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to do that, is incredibly rare, and it\u2019s not clear if Trump plans to do it.\n\nThe commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, will be on Capitol Hill testifying at a separate budget hearing at the same time as Hegseth and is likely to face similar questions.\n\nWhat Hegseth has focused on so far\n\nHegseth has spent vast amounts of time during his first five months in office promoting the social changes he\u2019s making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.\n\nMost recently, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. His spokesman, Sean Parnell, said the renaming was needed to ensure \u201cthe names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the commander-in-chief\u2019s priorities, our nation\u2019s history, and the warrior ethos.\u201d\n\nHegseth has posted numerous videos of his morning workouts with troops or of himself signing directives to purge diversity and equity programs and online content from the military. He has boasted of removing transgender service members from the force and firing so-called woke generals, many of whom were women.\n\nHe was on the international stage about a week ago, addressing an annual national security conference in Asia about threats from China. But a trip to NATO headquarters last week was quick and quiet, and he deliberately skipped a gathering of about 50 allies and partners where they discussed ongoing support for Ukraine.\n\nHis use of the Signal messaging app\n\nHegseth\u2019s hearing Tuesday before the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee will be his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Cabinet member.\n\nWhile he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.\n\nSet up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders and was used to share information about upcoming military strikes in Yemen.\n\nThe chat became a public embarrassment because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in this chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.\n\nMultiple investigations are looking into his use of Signal. The Defense Department\u2019s acting inspector general has been looking into the initial chat at the request of the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon\u2019s watchdog also is reviewing whether any of Hegseth\u2019s aides were asked to delete any Signal messages.\n\nControversial Pentagon spending\n\nWhile any number of those issues could come up at the House Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday, money issues are more likely to be the focus of the hearings Tuesday in the House and Wednesday before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee.\n\nAlready defense leaders have been grilled in other hearings on the plans to retrofit the Qatari jet and the costs of the military parade.

Meanwhile, Merge co-founder Mac McCaughan will continue in his role as label president and head of A&R, though co-founder and co-president Laura Ballance will leave the business. \n\n Other Merge staffers maintain their roles within the company, including label director Christina Rentz, Merge marketing director Jamie Beck and head of digital Wilson Fuller.\n\n Merge was founded by MacCaughan and Ballance in North Carolina in 1989 as a means of independently releasing music made by those within their immediate circle of friends. This included groups such as MacCaughan\u2019s Bricks and Wwax, alongside Metal Pitcher and Superchunk, which both featured MacCaughan and Ballance as members.\n\n Merge would attract plenty of attention throughout the \u201990s and \u201900s thanks to releases by bands such as Neutral Milk Hotel, The Magnetic Fields and Arcade Fire, with the latter proving to be a breakout success in the new millennium, giving the label their first appearance on the Billboard 200 with 2004\u2019s Funeral, and first chart-topper with 2010\u2019s The Suburbs.\n\n \u201cWe continue to be inspired and amazed by the musicians we work with,\u201d MacMcCaughan said in a statement. \u201cI have known many of the people in the Secretly world for decades, and I know that they share Merge\u2019s dedication to artists and getting their music into the hands of as many people as possible. \n\n \u201cWe have seen this in action working with Secretly Distribution\u2019s international team since 2012, and are excited about what the future looks like with the strength and experience of Secretly Distribution working for Merge artists around the world, and now here at home. I know Laura has her own exciting future ahead, and I am excited to continue and expand upon the label we\u2019ve run for 36 years.\u201d\n\n \u201cIt was never my goal to start a record label when I was 21 and run it for the rest of my life,\u201d Ballance said of her exit from the company. \u201cI have been doing this for 36 years now. Life is short. There are other things I have always wanted to do: make more art, travel for fun, volunteer more, write a book and lots of other things that being so entrenched in running a business does not allow me to do. \n\n \u201cMerge Records started as a literal bedroom label, in my bedroom, and lived there for a few years before we were able to give it some space of its own. It has always been a labor of love. I am going to miss it and all the people and bands tremendously.\u201d\n\n \u201cWhen we heard that Laura was looking to move on from Merge, we immediately engaged in conversations with Mac and Laura about what a new partnership with Secretly could look like,\u201d explained Waldorf, Secretly co-founder.\n\n \u201cWe looked up to Merge as we started our labels. We are not just fans of the music they\u2019ve released, but their independent ethos and commitment to being an artist-first company,\u201d he added. \u201cBecoming a partner in Merge is beyond a dream for me \u2013 I saw Superchunk for the first time when I was a teenager, before I even knew you could have a full-time job in independent music, and attended Merge\u2019s 5th Anniversary celebration at the Cat\u2019s Cradle while I was a college student in Athens, GA, making this a real \u2018pinch me\u2019 moment three decades later.\u201d\n\n As MacMcCaughan noted, Merge has already been working with Secretly Group\u2019s sister company Secretly Distribution for marketing and distribution services outside of North America for over a decade now. As part of the new partnership, Merge will continue to operate as a standalone label based in Durham, NC, while utilizing Secretly Distribution\u2019s worldwide distribution arm and aspects of the Secretly ecosystem such as accounting, artist royalties, business affairs, licensing, IT and HR.\n\n \u201cOur aim is to support Merge with the independent ecosystem we\u2019ve built at Secretly, while preserving what\u2019s truly special about what Mac and Laura have built over the past 36 years, such that we can support Merge\u2019s growth in the decades to come,\u201d added Swanston, Secretly Co-Founder. \n\n The first new album to be released following this partnership, and the first to be distributed worldwide by Secretly, will fittingly be Superchunk\u2019s Songs in the Key of Yikes, which is scheduled for an Aug. 22 release.", "summary": "\"We are not just fans of the music they've released, but their independent ethos and commitment to being an artist-first company,\" says Secretly co-founder Phil Waldorf.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/secretly-group-merge-records-partnership-laura-ballance/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2506-Secretly-Group-cr-Anna-Powell-Teeter.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 15:00:00", "author": "Tyler Jenke", "authors": ["Tyler Jenke"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.324}, {"id": 330022116, "title": "Secretly Group and Merge Records Form Partnership", "text": "Secretly Group has acquired a 50% stake in Merge Records, the influential indie label that released classic albums by the likes of Neutral Milk Hotel, Spoon, the Magnetic Fields, and Arcade Fire.

The conflict between the two men just further escalates existing tensions throughout the town and threatens to destroy the already tenuous bonds between its neighbors. \n\nThe new \u201cEddington\u201d trailer, which climaxes with Phoenix\u2019s Joe Cross unloading an entire machine gun\u2019s worth of bullets onto his town\u2019s deathly quiet streets, teases just some of the chaos and violence that moviegoers can expect to see when the film hits theaters this summer. You can watch the trailer yourself below.\n\nIn addition to Phoenix and Pascal, \u201cEddington\u201d also features \u201cThe Penguin\u201d star Deirdre O\u2019Connell, Emma Stone and Austin Butler. Stone stars in the film as Louise, the wife of Phoenix\u2019s Joe, while Butler portrays Vernon, a popular right-wing YouTuber. Together, the actors make up easily the most star-studded cast of Aster\u2019s career to date.\n\nLike Aster\u2019s last film, 2023\u2019s \u201cBeau is Afraid,\u201d \u201cEddington\u201d looks primed to be one of the year\u2019s most divisive films. It divided the critics who caught it at Cannes in May, and it currently holds a 65% Tomatometer score based on 49 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. In TheWrap\u2019s review, critic Ben Croll called the film \u201ca social satire as blunt and broad as America itself.\u201d\n\nIn the new \u201cEddington\u201d trailer, Phoenix\u2019s Joe urges everyone to free their hearts and question the cost of going to war with their neighbors, while also adding further fuel to several dangerous social fires. At Cannes, Aster revealed that he wrote \u201cEddington\u201d when he found himself caught in a \u201cstate of fear and anxiety about the world,\u201d and there is certainly a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety present in the footage that has so far been released from his latest film.\n\n\u201cEddington\u201d is set to hit theaters on Friday, July 18.", "summary": "The satirical thriller from director Ari Aster hits theaters July 18\n\n\nThe post &#8216;Eddington&#8217; Trailer: Joaquin Phoenix Goes to War With His Neighbors in A24&#8217;s COVID Western appeared first on TheWrap.", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/eddington-trailer-joaquin-phoenix-pedro-pascal-ari-aster-covid-movie/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Joaquin-Phoenix-Pedro-Pascal-Eddington.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 13:07:32", "author": "Alex Welch", "authors": ["Alex Welch"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.174}, {"id": 330014918, "title": "Eddington trailer: Pedro Pascal and Joaquin Phoenix trade blows in Ari Asters latest", "text": "Hereditary and Midsommar writer/director Ari Aster pits Pedro Pascal and Joaquin Phoenix against one another in the critically heralded thriller, Eddington. Eddington returns audiences to May of 2020, when COVID-19 brought the world to a standstill and protests over racial division and the murder of George Floyd rocked the US. In the small town of Eddington, New Mexico, the convergence of these issues has created a major rift, with Pascal's progressive Mayor Ted Garcia on one side and Phoenix's Sheriff Joe Cross on the other. When Joe challenges Ted in the next mayoral election, their rivalry sparks a powder keg that could have disastrous consequences for the entire town. (All 2,345 citizens.)\n\n Summer Movie Preview: What's coming to theaters and streaming?\n\nWhile Aster made his name in horror, the trailer for Eddington suggests it's more of a Western thriller, with the titular town not being big enough for both Joe and Ted's ambitions. Between Western staples like stand-offs and shootouts, the trailer above also re-visits the pandemic bubble of 2020, featuring everything from COVID-19 nasal swabs (ouch) to discussions of social distancing.The 2020 setting also allows Aster to explore the increased role social media and conspiracy theories played during social isolation. But Eddington goes beyond mere doomscrolling. Emma Stone plays Joe's conspiracy-obsessed wife Louise, while Austin Butler portrays the cult leader she latches onto. Get a sneak peek of their unsettling performances in the trailer above, which threads the needle between absurdity and the all-too real anxieties of 2020.Eddington also stars Luke Grimes, Deirdre O'Connell, Micheal Ward, Am\u00e9lie Hoeferle, Clifton Collins Jr., and William Belleau.Eddington hits opens exclusively in theaters on July 18.", "summary": "Ari Aster's \"Eddington,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, and Austin Butler, hits theaters July 18.", "url": "https://mashable.com/video/eddington-trailer-ari-aster-pedro-pascal", "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/01VjAPtQASy8z1fAdrQ3HqJ/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1749561240.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 14:17:28", "author": "Belen Edwards", "authors": ["Belen Edwards"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.376}]}, {"news": [{"id": 329927720, "title": "Paramount to cut 3% of U.S. workforce as it deepens cost-cutting", "text": "Paramount Global is cutting its U.S.-based staff by 3.5%, or several hundred employees, in the latest round of layoffs at the media company as it contends with the decline of the traditional pay-TV bundle and macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nThe company notified its staff of the impending layoffs on Tuesday morning, according to a memo viewed by CNBC.

The suit claims that CBS' \"60 Minutes\" program intentionally misled the public in its editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris about her presidential candidacy. The network has repeatedly said the claims are \"completely without merit.\" Legal experts have said they view the lawsuit as \"frivolous\" and an infringement on First Amendment rights.

The state said in its lawsuit that the Justice Department had \"no right to make such a demand\" and cited \"no authority which would allow them to issue or enforce the Certification Demand Letter\" to each local education agency. California defended the laws that have come into question, which allow athletes to participate in sports \"consistent with\" their gender identity and doesn\u2019t violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The state requested an injunction from the demand letter. Last week, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital that public school districts must \"certify in writing\" by June 9 that they will not abide by the California Interscholastic Federation\u2019s gender identity rules. \"Knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Dhillon wrote in the letter. RILEY GAINES TALKS PUBLIC'S REACTION TO SIMONE BILES' PERSONAL ATTACK: 'ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR HER' The California Interscholastic Federation governs public and private high school sports in the state and has a bylaw that requires its members to recognize gender identity in sports. All students should be able to participate in school sports \"in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on a student\u2019s records,\" the bylaw states. Dhillon, a former California-based conservative attorney, said the certifications she is seeking from the public school districts will \"ensure compliance\" with Title IX and help them to \"avoid legal liability.\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement the lawsuit was filed \"in anticipation of imminent legal retaliation against California\u2019s school systems\" failing to adhere to Dhillon\u2019s demand, according to the Los Angeles Times. \"The President and his Administration are demanding that California school districts break the law and violate the Constitution \u2014 or face legal retaliation.

The DOJ previously filed a lawsuit against Maine after the state repeatedly thumbed its nose at President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order to keep males out of girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.

During the episode, which was released on Tuesday, June 10, Paris broke her silence on their split and how a phone call from Powell changed everything \u2014 and addressed the romance rumors between the star and his Anyone But You costar Sydney Sweeney while they were dating.\n\n Paris revealed that the pair's relationship, which PEOPLE confirmed was over in April 2023, began to break down six months before their eventual split, which came amid fan speculation about a romantic relationship between Powell, 36, and Sweeney, 27.\n\n While not naming Powell or Sweeney, Paris referenced the speculation online about the pair and shared, \"It was just, this is what I have to do for my job. I had two options. I could either pretend like I was going along with everything and have everyone wonder, like, 'Are they hooking up? Are they not hooking up? Is she okay with this? What the f---?' Or stand up for myself and say, 'No, I'm actually not okay with this, and I'm walking away.' So that's what I decided to do ... I was shattered.\"\n\n \"I just wanted respect, especially if it's gonna be public,\" she continued. \"Like, don't make an ass out of me. Like, just don't make a fool out of someone you've been with for over three years talking about forever with. Just have some decency, you know? And at the end of the day, it was like, well, work comes first. And if that's the case, power to you, that's your priority. I gotta walk away. What sucked was how it was handled. I felt like I was just fed to the dogs.\"\n\n Paris then went on to criticize Powell for not shutting down the rumors at the time.\n\n \"Where are you when you just need to stand up and say, 'No, I would never cheat on my girlfriend. I wouldn't do that.' That's all that needed to be said. And that wasn't said ... Never once.\"\n\n \"It was serving them for their PR. Later on, it turned out that it was all, I don't know if there was a relationship there or not, but then they came out to say it was all a PR scheme at the expense of our relationship. Like, it was just crazy.\"\n\n \"Just to sell a movie or not, who knows?\" she continued, \"And I honestly hoped that they'd end up together, because I was like, at least it would make it worth it for me, you know? I hope they are in love or whatnot.\"\n\n Representatives for Powell and Sweeney did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n During the promotional tour of Anyone But You in April 2023, Powell and Sweeney touted their chemistry during an appearance for the rom-com at CinemaCon in Las Vegas.\n\n Months later, Sweeney addressed the romance rumors during an interview with Variety.\n\n \"It\u2019s a rom-com. That\u2019s what people want!\" she said. \"Glen and I don\u2019t really care. We have so much fun together, and we respect each other so much; he\u2019s such a hard worker, and I\u2019m a hard worker.\"\n\n The Euphoria star added, \"They want it. It\u2019s fun to give it to \u2019em.\u201d\n\n During an interview with Insider in December 2023, Powell opened up about the tension in his personal life, between his breakup with Paris and his promotional appearances with Sweeney ahead of their rom-com's premiere.\n\n \"Well, look, the only reason it made things harder for me to lean into that stuff was that I was going through a very real breakup amidst a promotional tour,\" Powell said of his and Sweeney's decision to \"lean in\" to their onscreen chemistry.\n\n The PEOPLE App is now available in the Apple App Store! Download it now for the most binge-worthy celeb content, exclusive video clips, astrology updates and more!\n\n \"I was with someone that I really loved and cared about and was trying to kind of make sense of a lot of stuff,\" the Twisters star shared. \"It was a lot easier for Sydney to lean into something like that because she's in a very committed and wonderful relationship and she's very happy. So it was a little harder for me.\" (At the time Sweeney was engaged to Jonathan Davino, though they called it off earlier this year.)\n\n Klipstein went on to ask Paris if she ever got \"clarity of whether or not you were cheated on,\" to which Paris responded, \"I have heard so many different sides of the story. I have no confirmation of what actually happened. I just know what my standards are. And for me, it just wasn't okay the way it was handled, period.\"\n\n In April 2023, PEOPLE confirmed that the actor and Paris broke off their relationship after three years of dating. According to a source, their relationship had previously been on the rocks, and his various filming locations put a strain on the dynamic.\n\n \"Gigi and Glen had broken up several times,\" the source told PEOPLE in 2023 at the time of their breakup. \"They had been on the rocks since Top Gun came out. Gigi was never happy with the long distance filming and when she came to Australia [where Powell was filming Anyone But You] they both decided to break up for good.\"\n\n During her podcast appearance, Paris denied distance was behind the split and detailed flying to Australia \u2014 where Powell was filming Anyone But You \u2014 to end things with the actor after a phone call she got from him changed everything.\n\n \"I got a phone call from him right when I was about to go to Australia to work,\" Paris said, adding that \"all this s--- was coming out on the Internet.\"\n\n \"And he called and said, the producers and I have discussed that I think it's best that you don't come to visit ... And that's when I hung up. And I was like, this motherf----- is done to me,\" she added.\n\n \"That phone call really is what broke me,\" she continued. \"I thought we had hope, like, maybe when I got there that, like, things would maybe get better. But once I got that phone call, I just knew it was done. I had lost whoever that person was that I loved.\"\n\n \"I went anyways just to look him in the eye and break up with him,\" Paris said, adding \"it was the hardest thing I'd ever had to do.\" \"But then I was stuck there for two weeks doing my jobs. And there was a rule, like, I was not allowed near set. I was not allowed anywhere near production. It was very bizarre,\" she added.\n\n The Hit Man star and Paris were first linked in early 2020 when they were spotted on a romantic vacation in Mexico. The couple made their relationship Instagram official a year later.\n\n Amid their split, some speculated that Powell's chemistry with Sweeney played a role, especially after Paris unfollowed the Euphoria actress on Instagram. However, another source told PEOPLE there was no truth to the rumors.\n\n \"Gigi only unfollowed Sydney on social media because Sydney never followed her back. This had nothing to do with Glen and Sydney. Gigi is aware that Glen and Sydney never hooked up,\" the insider said, adding that the model felt the distance when Glen was on set. \"He takes his work very seriously, and it was tough on the relationship.\"\n\n Paris also addressed the more recent rumors about Powell and Sweeney amid Sweeney's breakup from her fianc\u00e9 Davino. \"Like I said, like, I hope that if they're meant to be, that they're meant to be. It's really none of my business anymore. Like, that's what I really wanted the end to be, is to just to walk away from that, because it's a f------ circus,\" she said, adding, \"Like, the way that they handle things for headlines or whatnot, like, I don't live that way. So you do you. It's none of my business anymore.\"", "summary": "The 'Top Gun: Maverick' actor and model broke up in early 2023 after about three years of dating", "url": "https://people.com/glen-powell-ex-gigi-paris-breaks-silence-breakup-sydney-sweeney-romance-rumors-11750931", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/sIptYSjJA8B99ygZLxqCUVnc0x8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(752x186:754x188)/glen-powell-gigi-paris-sydney-sweeney-061025-1a-543cea0781ec4578a98ef920831cb55c.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 11:56:02", "author": "Kirsty Hatcher,Zoey Lyttle", "authors": ["Kirsty Hatcher", "Zoey Lyttle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.353}, {"id": 329976134, "title": "Glen Powell Ex Gigi Paris Breaks Silence on Sydney Sweeney Rumors", "text": "Since starring in Speed together in 1994, rumors have raced over the decades that Keanu and Sandra had an off-screen romance.

At the time, Sweeney was engaged to her longtime partner and co-producer, businessman Jonathan Davino, although they called it off earlier this year.\n\n \"I just wanted respect, especially if it's gonna be public,\" Paris told Klipstein of seeing the headlines speculating a relationship between Powell and Sweeney \u2014 although she doesn't name either actor.\n\n \"Like, don't make an ass out of me,\" she continued. \"Like, just don't make a fool out of someone you've been with for over three years talking about forever with. Just have some decency, you know? And at the end of the day, it was like, well, work comes first. And if that's the case, power to you, that's your priority. I gotta walk away. What sucked was how it was handled. I felt like I was just fed to the dogs.\"\n\n The model recalled the moment that kicked off the beginning of the end \u2014 fan fervor over something Powell had shared on Instagram. \"I'm getting tagged over something he wrote on a photo and I screenshot it to him and said, 'Hey, the whole world is watching what you say so just like, proceed with caution. Please.' And that wasn't received well.\"\n\n Paris lamented that she felt there wasn't a desire to \"meet me halfway\" when she addressed her concerns. \"It wasn't [gaslighting], it was just, 'This is what I have to do for my job.'\"\n\n Reps for Glen Powell did not immediately respond to Entertainment Weekly's request for comment.\n\n Powell and Sweeney starred as the leads in Anyone but You, a twist on Shakespeare\u2019s Much Ado About Nothing that follows two exes on an enemies-to-lovers trajectory after they hatch a fake dating scheme to trick their friends and family. They frequently made headlines in 2023 when fans spotted them looking cozy together in Australia while filming the movie \u2014 despite both stars being in relationships.\n\n During her podcast appearance, Paris said, \"I had two options. I could either pretend like I was going along with everything and have everyone wonder, like, 'Are they hooking up? Is she okay with this?' Or stand up for myself and say, 'No, I'm actually not okay with this, and I'm walking away.' So that's what I decided to do ... I was shattered.\"\n\n \"I hit a threshold of what I could take and that was that,\" she recalled, saying that she had 'flew halfway across the world' to confront Powell in person. \"It just seemed as if make-believe was more important than the real thing.\"\n\n Paris went on to say that it was a phone call before she was flying to Australia where Powell was filming that affirmed their relationship was over.\n\n \"He called and said, 'The producers and I have discussed that I think it's best that you don't come to visit ... And that's when I hung up. And I was like, this motherf---er is done to me,\" Paris said.\n\n \"That phone call really is what broke me. I thought we had hope, like, maybe when I got there that, like, things would maybe get better,\" she added. \"But once I got that phone call, I just knew it was done. I had lost whoever that person was that I loved.\"\n\n Paris recalled experiencing \"a weird whiplash of emotions\" after moving out of her shared space with Powell because there was still speculation about a romance between him and Sweeney.\n\n \"The bare minimum of any relationship is to have your partner's back. Where are you when you just need to stand up and say, 'No, I would never cheat on my girlfriend. I wouldn't do that.' That's all that needed to be said. And that wasn't said ... Never once,\" she said.\n\n The model griped that the acting duo later \"came out to say it was all a PR scheme,\" which she said was a priority \"at the expense of our relationship.\"\n\n When Klipstein asked Paris if she ever got \"clarity of whether or not you were cheated on,\" Paris said, \"I have no confirmation of what actually happened. I just know what my standards are. And for me, it just wasn't okay the way it was handled, period.\"\n\n Want more movie news?

Like, that's what I really wanted the end to be, is to just to walk away from that, because it's a f---ing circus.

Gavin Newsom do not want and that the police chief says makes it harder to handle the protests safely.\n\n\"We stated very publicly that it's 60 days because we want to ensure that those rioters, looters and thugs on the other side assaulting our police officers know that we're not going anywhere,\" Hegseth told members of the House appropriations defense subcommittee.\n\nAfter persistent questioning from members of Congress, Hegseth turned to his acting comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, who provided the total and said this \"is largely just the cost of travel, housing and food.\"\n\nShe said the money will come from operations and maintenance accounts.\n\nMarine Corps Gen. Eric Smith told a budget hearing on Capitol Hill that the battalion has not yet been sent to any protests. The Marines were trained for crowd control but have no arrest authority and are there to protect government property and federal personnel, he said.\n\nTrump doubled the number of Guard troops being deployed soon after the first wave of 2,000 began arriving Sunday following days of protests driven by anger over the president's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws that critics say are breaking apart migrant families.\n\nThe demonstrations continued Monday but were far less raucous, with thousands of people peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds more protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles, a city of 4 million people, have largely been centered in several blocks of downtown. At daybreak Tuesday, guard troops were stationed outside the detention center, but there was no sign of the Marines.\n\nTrump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. They say he is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement that he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department would present a \"significant logistical and operational challenge.\"\n\nNewsom called the deployments reckless and \"disrespectful to our troops\" in a post on the social platform X.\n\n\"This isn't about public safety,\" the governor said. \"It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego.\"\n\nThe protests began Friday after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people across the city. The smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, a day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.\n\nProtests against the immigration raids spread Monday to other cities nationwide, including San Francisco and Santa Ana, California, as well as Dallas and Austin, Texas. Authorities in Austin appeared to use chemical irritants to disperse a crowd that gathered near the state Capitol. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted on social media that more than a dozen protesters were arrested.\n\nCalifornia pushes back against presence of federal troops\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters that Trump had \"trampled\" the state's sovereignty.\n\n\"We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops,\" Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.\n\nTrump said the city would have been \"completely obliterated\" if he had not deployed the Guard.\n\nU.S. officials said the Marines were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel, including immigration agents. A convoy of buses with blacked-out windows and escorted by sheriff's vehicles, left the base at Twentynine Palms in the desert east of Los Angeles late Monday and headed toward the city, stopping overnight at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, south of LA.\n\nDespite their presence, there has been limited engagement so far between the Guard and protesters while local law enforcement implements crowd control.\n\nProtests remained peaceful Monday\n\nThousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally Monday before a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest Friday while protesting immigration raids became a rallying cry for people angry over the crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers.\n\nProtesters danced and linked hands in front of a line of police officers outside the downtown federal detention center where Huerta was being held. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organizers at times to de-escalate moments of tension.\n\nAs the crowd thinned, police began pushing protesters away from the area, firing crowd-control munitions as people chanted, \"Peaceful protest.\" Officers became more aggressive in their tactics in the evening, occasionally surging forward to arrest protesters that got too close. At least a dozen people were surrounded by police and detained.\n\nOutside a clothing warehouse in LA County, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.\n\nThe family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him.\n\n\"Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,\" Vasquez's brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.\n\nSeveral dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend protests. Authorities say one was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.\n\nGuard deployment is a nearly unprecedented escalationThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.\n\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is \"a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\"\n\nSullivan reported from Minneapolis and Baldor reported from Washington.

Then, late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riot allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response, and Activision confirmed Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast after players expressed concern about new voices.\n\nNow, however, the union said it has reached a \"tentative agreement,\" subject to review and approval of its national board.

The complaint alleged that over the last six months, Llama Productions (owned by Epic Games) had failed to bargain in good faith with SAG-AFTRA's video game actors and had made \"unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work\" on Fortnite.\n\nAnd in March, Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed an AI Aloy video that leaked online, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors. Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling \u201cworried about game performance as an art form,\u201d and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the video game voice actors strike.\n\n\u201cCurrently what we\u2019re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you\u2019re using this AI double,\u201d Burch explained.\n\n\u201cI feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone\u2019s performance attached to it, that does have someone\u2019s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn\u2019t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.

SAG-AFTRA members struck specific games and studios over \"critical AI protections\" to ensure voice actors wouldn't be working to replace their own jobs with generative AI.\nAs the 30 Apex Legends actors who refused to sign an agreement back in February of this year put it, there's been not entirely unsubstantiated fear that \"give up our expertise to train the generative AI that will replace us tomorrow\".\n\nRelated articles\n\n8 months into their strike, videogame voice actors say the industry's latest proposal is 'filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse'\n\nSAG-AFTRA makes exception for student devs and game jams in 8-month videogame performance strike: 'I'm thrilled that these types of projects can now be accommodated'\n\nSAG-AFTRA files unfair labor practice complaint against Epic over Fortnite's AI-powered Darth Vader: 'We must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members'\n\nOther major voice actors from games like Baldur's Gate 3, Mass Effect, and more have shown fear and frustration\u2014both at the rise of generative AI technology, and games companies speaking effusively about it, seeming downright excited to cut out the kind of creative talent responsible for their past successes.\n\nAs SAG-AFTRA's official announcement reads, the union has \"reached a tentative agreement on terms for the Interactive Media Contract, subject to review and approval by the National Board and ratification by the membership in the coming weeks. Specific details of the agreement will be released with the ratification materials.\"\nThe agreement, in particular, is with some big names, \"which include Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.\"\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's national executive director and chief negotiator, says the agreement \"puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers\u2019 livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nIt's been a particularly brutal strike in a particularly brutal year (years, if we're being honest) for the games industry at large\u2014with strikebreaking voice actors, replacing the roles of actors on strike, causing turmoil in game communities like Genshin Impact.\nThose particular waters have been further muddied by players' frustration that their English cutscenes have gone unvoiced for a while, despite SAG-AFTRA fighting for the working rights of the actors they're missing out on\u2014conspiracy theories, unfortunately, abound.\nAs one actor put it at the time: \"'Keeping the characters hostage from us and hurting our experience' WHAT?!?

This follows the deployment of the National Guard and several days of protests in San Francisco and Los Angeles that local and state police have struggled to get under control. Of course, the administration hasn't decided what the rules of engagement are just yet. Or where the deployed troops should sleep:\n\n You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are \u2014 being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/4i8VIiYZLr pic.twitter.com/sUYD2KHu6O \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) June 9, 2025\n\n\"A statement by the U.S. Northern Command said that 2,100 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines will protect federal personnel and property under the command of Task Force 51, the headquarters that has been assigned the mission,\" reports The Wall Street Journal. \"The forces have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force, the command said.\" But California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has objected to these deployments, saying this is escalatory and a violation of state sovereignty. And yesterday, the state sued the Trump administration over its deployment of state troops and U.S. Marines, calling it \"illegal.\"\n\nBloomberg notes:\n\nThe law strictly limits the federal deployment of troops within US borders. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, along with amendments and supporting regulations, generally bars the use of the active-duty U.S. military\u2014the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines\u2014from carrying out domestic law enforcement. Important exceptions to the 1878 law are contained in the 1807 Insurrection Act and its modern iterations, which allow the president, without congressional approval, to employ the military for domestic use in certain circumstances. The Insurrection Act has been used very rarely to deploy troops under federal control domestically without a request from a state government, with examples mostly dating from the Civil Rights era.\n\nSo this might explain Trump's use of insurrectionist language: He's giving himself legal room, and he's already made clear he loves using statutes from the 18th and 19th centuries, meant for times of war, to expand his own power. \"The people who are causing the problems are bad people, they are insurrectionists,\" the president told a group of reporters Monday. He added that Newsom, a vociferous critic of the administration's actions, is \"a nice guy\" but also \"grossly incompetent.\"\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan has been making the TV rounds, promising arrests for anyone who obstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's ability to do its job\u2014hinting that even public officials might meet a sorry fate.\n\n\"Come and get me, tough guy,\" Newsom had told Homan, antagonizing him a bit. \"I'd do it if I were Tom,\" said the president. But like so much of partisan politics right now, all that appears to have been bluster. \"There's no intention to arrest\" California's governor, Homan backtracked yesterday.\n\nRFK Jr.'s big shakeup: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. just fired the entire 17-member Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), which reports its findings to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"to avoid conflicts of interest\" and to \"restore public trust in vaccines.\"\n\n\"The U.S. faces a crisis of public trust,\" writes Kennedy in The Wall Street Journal. \"Whether toward health agencies, pharmaceutical companies or vaccines themselves, public confidence is waning. Some would try to explain this away by blaming misinformation or antiscience attitudes. To do so, however, ignores a history of conflicts of interest, persecution of dissidents, a lack of curiosity, and skewed science that has plagued the vaccine regulatory apparatus for decades.\"\n\nKennedy cites the Rotashield incident as an example: \"Committee members regularly participated in deliberations and advocated products in which they had a financial stake,\" he argues in the Journal. \"The CDC issued conflict-of-interest waivers to every committee member. Four out of eight ACIP members who voted in 1997 on guidelines for the Rotashield vaccine, subsequently withdrawn because of severe adverse events, had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies developing other rotavirus vaccines.\" This was further confirmed by the HHS Inspector General's report in 2009.\n\nSome of these now-dismissed ACIP appointees had been selected by former President Joe Biden in January. The last-minute series of appointments seems to have been intended to preserve a pro-vaccine majority on ACIP heading into a potential shift like the one we're seeing now. But Biden may not have taken into account the degree to which the Trump administration prefers to move fast and break things.\n\nLike with so much of what RFK Jr. peddles, there's a grain of truth within: The Rotashield incident was disturbing, and increased transparency into advisory committee actions would be good; but an incident from 30 years ago (that was subsequently investigated and rectified) doesn't necessarily mean the whole advisory board should be thrown out or that all of their decision making is invalidated. And Kennedy relies on strange reasoning at times, objecting to the \"exploding\" immunization schedule. But the sheer number of doses recommended does not tell us very much about whether those vaccines are safe and valuable, and what types of risks are present.\n\nIt's hard to say how much this actually changes things or how worried you should be: ACIP reviews new vaccines but is also tasked with evaluating existing vaccines. Lots of families already make the choice to deviate from the standard vaccination schedule, mostly in minor ways that don't really cause significant issues with herd immunity (i.e. delaying a less-important vaccine\u2014think rotavirus or PCV, not polio\u2014by six months or 1 year, or spacing out the doses). The traditional childhood vaccines\u2014polio, MMR, DTaP\u2014still have rather high uptake rates (over 90 percent; higher for polio), and newer vaccines not generally required by public schools like HPV and COVID have high opt-out rates. Though skepticism toward the MMR vaccine has increased at times since the '90s, uptake is still decently high.\n\nIt will probably take a long time for school immunization schedules to drastically change, and parents' decisions will probably continue to roughly track those requirements; but it is also possible that a new ACIP could overhaul all of this, give parents worse recommendations for how to vaccinate their children that lead to cyclical outbreaks (like measles), or that a showdown could take place where school districts and the federal government are at odds as to what requirements ought to exist.\n\n\"I support vaccines,\" RFK Jr. said in his confirmation hearings back in January. \"I support the childhood [immunization] schedule.\" Maybe so, but in his new posting, he has an awful lot of power to alter both requirements and recommendations. Turns out Cabinet appointments have real consequences.\n\n The state Senate passed the Medical Aid in Dying assisted suicide bill yesterday. Now it heads to Gov. Kathy Hochul's desk. But a few components of this bill make it very different from others in states like Oregon and Vermont: There's no waiting period and physicians aren't required to fill out reports to state authorities (so it will be very hard to track data to learn how many people are availing themselves of this option). Furthermore, the text specifies that assisted suicide is only available to patients who will be dead within six months according to \"reasonable medical judgment\" but it does not specify whether this means with or without treatment.\n\n\"There is no waiting period in the New York bill. That's the first time I've seen this,\" bioethicist Richard Doerflinger told The Free Press. A patient could say \"in a moment of despair at first getting his or her diagnosis, 'Oh my God, I just want to die,' and sign off, and that's the end of the process.\"\n\n Waymo will be suspending service in San Francisco, where protests are also underway, after part of its taxi fleet was damaged by L.A. protesters and rioters. (\"Waymos don't have human drivers, they're devoid of humanity,\" one San Francisco activist told The New York Times. Destroying the robot taxis is \"symbolic of the attempts, throughout the history of this country, by the tech industry to strip us of community.\") Inside Peru's gang-driven crime wave \"Elon Musk's allies inside the Trump administration are newly vulnerable after the mogul's bitter public breakup with the president,\" reports Semafor. \"MAGA loyalists are taking advantage of the Trump-Musk rift to threaten the standing of anyone in the administration who's perceived as too close to the Tesla CEO. Leading that charge is former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, whose long-running animosity toward Musk peaked last week with the former calling to deport Musk from the US and the latter deeming Bannon a 'Communist retard.'\" Bannon has started criticizing David Sacks in particular, apparently.

The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines would support the soldiers, who have been placed under federal command, to protect federal personnel and buildings, said John Ingle, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command.\n\nBy 2:45 p.m. Monday afternoon, the Marines\u2019 status was moved to \u201cactivated\u201d for deployment. The number of Marines requested by the Northern Command, which is overseeing this operation, was increased from 500 to 700, Ingle said.\n\n\u201cThat means they are no longer preparing to deploy, but they\u2019ve been given the thumbs up to begin the process to move out,\u201d Ingle said. A second spokesperson said later on Monday, the Marines would leave the desert base on Monday night.\n\nThe Marines, a 1st Marine Division infantry battalion, will be \u201ckitted up similar to what the National Guard uses,\u201d he added, but didn\u2019t specify the actual weapons and vehicles that would be used.\n\nThe unit is trained in de-escalation, crowd control and in standing rules for the use of force, Northern Command said.\n\nDeploying the Marines is leading some to call the order an \u201coverreach of authoritarian power,\u201d especially as the military servicemembers could find themselves facing off with civilians.\n\n\u201cOur Marines are trained for deadly combat, not law enforcement,\u201d Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, said in a statement. \u201cThis politicizes our Armed Forces and it clearly will not end well. If the president truly wants law and order, he must de-escalate, order our service members back to their bases, and allow our courageous state and local law enforcement officers to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe state has sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard. State officials said the move was unnecessary and Attorney General Rob Bonta said it \u201ctrampled\u201d California\u2019s sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThe level of escalation is completely unwarranted, uncalled for, and unprecedented \u2014 mobilizing the best-in-class branch of the U.S. military against its own citizens,\u201d the governor\u2019s press office said in a tweet Monday about the readying of the Marines.\n\nIngle said the use of the Marines comes by order of the president and the secretary of defense.\n\n\u201cThey can be deployed to protect federal employees and buildings, similar to Marines who were used to fight the California wildfires and those who were sent to the border,\u201d Ingle said.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell, on Monday, released a statement that he had not received notification that the Marines were inbound.\n\n\u201cThe possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles \u2014 absent clear coordination \u2014 presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us charged to safeguard this city,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThe Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, has decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so effectively and professionally. That said, our top priority is the safety of the public and the officers on the ground. We are urging open and continuous lines of communication between all agencies to prevent confusion and avoid escalation.\u201d\n\nLevin called Trump\u2019s use of the Marines an \u201castounding overreach of authoritarian power,\u201d adding that the state has not asked for the National Guard, let alone the Marines.\n\n\u201cI support the right to protest peacefully\u2014it\u2019s essential for a healthy democracy. I also strongly condemn the agitators who are committing acts of violence. Their behavior is unacceptable and they are giving Trump the images he wants,\u201d Levin added.\n\n\u201cOur state and local authorities have the capacity to handle the protests in Los Angeles,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBy deploying warfighters to American cities, Trump is escalating and destabilizing a volatile situation. He is putting our service members in an untenable situation where they will be asked to repress civilians.\u201d\n\nUnder an 1878 law called the Posse Comitatus Act, it is normally illegal to use federal troops on domestic soil for policing purposes.\n\nBut an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, creates an exception to that ban for situations in which the president decides that \u201cunlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States,\u201d make it \u201cimpracticable\u201d to enforce federal law.\n\nA president last used federal troops for domestic policing purposes in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush invoked the Insurrection Act to suppress widespread rioting that broke out in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted police officers who had been videotaped beating a Black motorist, Rodney King.\n\nIn that case, though, then Gov. Pete Wilson and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley had asked for federal assistance in restoring order.\n\nPresidents have not used federal troops without the permission of state governors since the civil rights movement, when Southern governors defied court orders to desegregate public schools.\n\nStaff Reporter Kaitlyn Schallhorn and the New York Times contributed to this report.", "summary": "A U.S. Northern Command spokesman said the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines were expected to head out by trucks to Los Angeles Monday night.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/10/500-marines-from-twentynine-palms-are-preparing-to-support-national-guard-in-l-a/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LDN-L-GUARD-PROTESTS-0609-5-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 13:22:05", "author": "Erika I.

There's no news about casting, release, or even who exactly is writing \"Wonder Woman\".Still, even with such sparse details, this should be good news for \"Wonder Woman\" fans who have experienced a tough few years of news. It was just earlier this year that an announced \"Wonder Woman\" video game had been canceled by Warner Bros.Then, of course, there was \"Wonder Woman 3,\" which would have seen the return of Gal Gadot to her signature role. Final confirmation that the threequel was as dead as the DCEU didn't come until last year.Gal Gadot debuted as Wonder Woman in 2016's \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\" before starring in her own film, 2017's \"Wonder Woman\". The latter feature remains one of the more universally embraced chapters of the DCEU, critically and commercially.\"Wonder Woman 1984\", released in 2020, was not as well received as its predecessor.Gadot would go on to reprise the role for \"Justice League\", \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\", \"Shazam! Fury of the Gods\", and \"The Flash\".Whoever takes over the role from Gadot will certainly have big boots to fill.Whenever it arrives, \"Wonder Woman\" won't be the only content planned revolving around the iconic heroine. There's also the \"Paradise Lost\" series planned for HBO Max about the Amazons of Themyscria, Wonder Woman's homeland.About the series' development, Gunn told EW it was \"slow moving, but it's moving.\"\"Superman\" hits theaters July 11 and the success or failure of the blockbuster will likely have a lot to do with the DCU as a whole moving forward.Should ticket sales meet or exceed expectations, and everything from the introductions of Wonder Woman to that of a new Batman in \"The Brave and the Bold\" may start moving at a much quicker pace.More Comics:Chris Evans Shares Brutally Honest Feelings About 'Avengers: Doomsday'Ryan Coogler Confirms Denzel Washington Has a Part in 'Black Panther 3", "summary": "DC Studios co-head James Gunn confirms a new 'Wonder Woman\" movie is on the way.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/comics/james-gunn-confirms-wonder-woman-movie-works-2083546", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1888328/gal-gadot-wonder-woman.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 16:46:54", "author": "Michileen Martin", "authors": ["Michileen Martin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.099}, {"id": 330040256, "title": "New \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Movie Is Being Written Right Now, DC Studios Head James Gunn Says", "text": "It is still early days for DC Studios and James Gunn\u2018s plans to reboot its cinematic universe, but he has revealed that moves are being made for Wonder Woman to eventually be a part of it. \n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the \u201cSuperman\u201d director revealed that a new \u201cWonder Woman\u201d film is \u201cbeing written right now,\u201d alongside an already-announced HBO series \u201cParadise Island,\u201d which will focus on the superhero\u2019s homeland of Themyscira and which Gunn says development is \u201cslow moving, but it\u2019s moving.\u201d\n\nWonder Woman made her big screen debut in 2017 with Gal Gadot playing her in an origin tale that sees Diana Prince leave her idyllic home with American pilot Steve Trevor to join the fight in World War I.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: OnLeaks)\n\nSamsung's talking up the Galaxy Z Fold 7's apparently groundbreaking design in a new teaser, making some pretty big claims about its new foldable in the process.\n\nPer the post written on Samsung's news site: \"The newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet \u2013 meticulously crafted and built to last.\"\nThe post ends with a repeat of the last teaser's closing line: \"The Ultra experience is ready to unfold.\" There's disagreement about what exactly Samsung's hinting at with this phrase. We may be about to see a new Galaxy Z Fold 7 UItra model, a new name for an otherwise familiar foldable, or some other plan by Samsung to emphasize the power of its new Z Fold at the launch event.\n\nYou may like\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be the thinnest foldable ever made\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 dimensions leak \u2014 this really could be the world's thinnest foldable\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 thickness could mean reduced battery life \u2014 what we know\n\n(Image credit: Samsung)\nThese evocative words are accompanied by a graphic of what we assume is the Galaxy Z Fold 7. There's minimal detail, but it backs up the thin and light promise made by the text.\n\nThere's no sign of rear cameras in this GIF though, which we're assuming is because of artistic license rather than Samsung going against the leaked renders and cutting the camera bumps off of its new foldable.\nBIg promises\nEarlier in the post, Samsung talks about the point of the Galaxy Z Fold being a device that \"blends versatility with portability,\" and how \"Samsung engineers and designers are refining each generation of the Galaxy Z series to be thinner, lighter and more durable than the last.\"\nSamsung also makes reference to 2019's Galaxy Fold, and what a cutting-edge device it was. That we won't dispute, although we have to point out how troubled that particular phone's launch was, with the Galaxy Z Fold 2 being Samsung's first proper attempt at a foldable phone for normal buyers.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nWe're a long way from the days of the first foldable phones though, and Samsung's models through to the current Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 have been consistently good.\nHowever, they have fallen behind the thinner and more innovative competition from brands like OnePlus and Oppo, Honor and Xiaomi, and even Google to an extent with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Change is needed, and the two teasers we've had so far suggests Samsung knows it's got something worth shouting about this year.\nLeaked specs suggest the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be considerably larger and lighter than the previous model, with an internal specs bump to keep up with the best Android phones already launched this year.\nWith the next Galaxy Unpacked event coming in July, potentially a month or less away from now, it hopefully won't be long until we understand exactly what Samsung was driving at with these teasers, and if it'll be enough to put Samsung back at the top of our best foldable phones guide.\nMore from Tom's Guide\n\nDelete these 20 apps right now if you downloaded them from the Play Store \u2014 they\u2019re malicious\nWWDC 2025 Live: iOS 26, Liquid Glass and all the biggest Apple event announcements\niOS 26 announced \u2014 here's all the new features for your iPhone\n\nToday's best Samsung Galaxy S25 deals\n\n $799.99Preorder\n\n $799.99View\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nSee more Phones News\n\nRichard Priday\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nAssistant Phones Editor\n\nRichard is based in London, covering news, reviews and how-tos for phones, tablets, gaming, and whatever else people need advice on.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future)\n\nSamsung has confirmed that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be thinner, lighter, and more durable than the previous model\nThe company appears to also be saying that the same will be true of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\nUnsurprisingly, these phones are also said to be the company's most advanced foldables\n\nWe\u2019re expecting the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 to both be unveiled in July, but ahead of that Samsung is already teasing these devices, and a new blog post gives us some idea of what to expect from their designs.\n\nA post on Samsung Newsroom specifically states that \u201cthe newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet.\u201d\nSo in other words the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be thinner and lighter than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, and while the article seems focused on the Fold, it says \u2018Galaxy Z\u2019 rather than \u2018Galaxy Z Fold\u2019, suggesting that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will also probably be thinner and lighter than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.\n\nYou may like\n\nA new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leak may have revealed the foldable phone's dimensions and super-thin bezels\n\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung might have finally stopped treading water\n\nWe just got a big hint that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 are on schedule\n\nSamsung doesn\u2019t get specific about how slim and light, but leaks have suggested the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be just 3.9mm thick when unfolded and either 8.2mm or 8.9mm thick when folded. That\u2019s down from 5.6mm and 12.1mm for the Z Fold 6 when unfolded and folded respectively. The Z Fold 6 is also 239g, so the Galaxy Z Fold 7 should be lighter than that.\n\nPrior to today we hadn\u2019t heard any reports of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 being slimmer, but for reference the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is 6.9mm thick when unfolded and 14.9mm when folded, and it weighs 187g.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)\nBuilt to last\nAs well as being slimmer and lighter than their predecessors, Samsung\u2019s upcoming foldables will also be more advanced and more durable according to this post.\nIt would be surprising if they weren\u2019t more advanced, but hearing that they\u2019re set to be more durable is reassuring, since foldable phones are inherently quite fragile.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nAgain, Samsung doesn\u2019t get specific about how the durability will be improved, but leaks have suggested that both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could have a more durable hinge mechanism, while the former could also have better water resistance and a tough titanium backplate.\nWe should find out exactly what upgrades Samsung has planned soon, as leaks suggest both phones could land on July 10.\nYou might also like\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 could have a huge screen with tiny bezels\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tipped to bring 'industry-first' features \u2013 here's what they could be\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 will launch with Android 16\n\nSee more News about Phones\n\nJames Rogerson\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

Samsung announced in a brief, almost hilariously vague blog post on its website on Tuesday that the \"the newest Galaxy Z series\" will be the thinnest and lightest batch of foldables from the company to date. That's...pretty much the only bit of news in the blog post. Samsung didn't say when the foldables will be shown off, how many foldables there will be, what they will be called, or even specifically how thin and light they will be. However, we can use a combination of common sense and leaks to fill in some of those blanks. Samsung announces new foldables every summer, so it probably won't be long now before we actually see these devices. Barring a true surprise, there will almost certainly be two foldables: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, assuming Samsung sticks to its usual routine. If Samsung's specific verbiage in the blog post is to be trusted, both will be thinner and lighter than before.\n\n You May Also Like\n\n window.videoEmbeds = window.videoEmbeds || [];\n let data = [];\n data.excoPlayListId = '6825f5751ad7f3226d4a8257';\n data.excoPlayListVideos = {\"437bc9a7-ce8b-4423-abb8-2f472919cbf1\":\"039WK52j7sLJWhl7SkIM2C8\",\"567e577c-b758-4a66-bf72-deed9ffb906f\":\"036WSJSV1xYrDxGXK2lGCEz\",\"5730cfd6-9841-41f0-b64a-4b9cd9510a46\":\"00BNjjW6HAiFI1iomfJYbrG\",\"5b084e45-7c10-438c-afd7-82fe6e3e47b2\":\"00IxrAaQCMoxgGvGRxA3qSE\",\"63740f1f-a851-4805-a6c0-24949d15a6f5\":\"04Kw19Z0LrOlJYMW2VH9T5R\",\"a71352f2-a32d-49c1-ba68-8765bea60aee\":\"07Il2yJpaPmz658hGQvgrNm\",\"bd3ad3e6-2b32-4c54-a1b6-f7ab803aad49\":\"007QkEa3SoGojzBMXRczPPb\",\"e4571d8c-cd58-439d-9e5c-7e09980246af\":\"04dZ0EYuzGHFASND7S4Vc7y\",\"f00f1d26-b172-4ac3-9e17-3f30d0c2a775\":\"0308oKOG8pdqiZnLItidscb\",\"f2ecef65-dcd2-40a3-a66d-74f8b198aaac\":\"02JYtCHw9udB9WTnGKOuID6\"};\n data.playlistItemCallback = function (item, index) {\n if (item.title) {\n document.getElementById(\"video-title-container-6825f5751ad7f3226d4a8257\").innerText = item.title;\n\n window.videoEmbeds.push({\n elemId: 'video-container-6825f5751ad7f3226d4a8257',\n data: data,\n videoPlayerType: 'related-contextual',\n\n 7 Samsung Galaxy S25 settings to change right away (and 1 you definitely shouldn't)\n\nBeyond that, prolific tech leaker @UniverseIce on X (via TechRadar) claimed in May that the Z Fold 7 specifically will be just 3.9mm thick in its unfolded state and 8.9mm when folded.

During his time at Vogue, he spearheaded a number of initiatives and projects, including the Vogue Vintage Market, which raised more than $500,000 this year for victims of the Los Angeles wildfires. He also previously served for nearly three years as the editor-in-chief of GARAGE and worked before that as an Arts Editor at Vogue from 2012 to 2017.\n\nHis new appointment marks a full-circle moment for Guiducci, who began his professional career as an assistant to the managing editor at Vanity Fair.\n\n\u201cThe world today is spinning faster than ever, as the forces of Hollywood, politics, the arts, money, and style collide with all the drama of a Verdi opera in its final act. At the center of it all, documenting the stakes and the spectacle, is Vanity Fair,\u201d Guiducci said in a statement of his own Tuesday. \u201cMy first job out of college was here and it proved to be the most extraordinary journalism school I could have imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo return now, fifteen years later, as global editorial director\u2014reuniting with former colleagues and meeting new ones around the world\u2014is the honor of my career. I am profoundly grateful to Roger, Stan and Anna for this opportunity and cannot wait to get started,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt will be a great adventure.\u201d", "summary": "He has served as creative editorial director at Vogue since 2020\n\n\nThe post Cond\u00e9 Nast Names Mark Guiducci as Vanity Fair&#8217;s First Global Editorial Director appeared first on TheWrap.", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/vanity-fair-global-editorial-director-mark-guiducci-conde-nast/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mark-Guiducci.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-10 17:05:44", "author": "Alex Welch", "authors": ["Alex Welch"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.449}]}, {"news": [{"id": 329972172, "title": "How to get carbide scraps in Dune: Awakening", "text": "Skip to main content\n\nPC Gamer THE GLOBAL AUTHORITY ON PC GAMES\n\nSearch PC Gamer\n\nView Profile\n\nMovies & TV\n\nGaming Industry\n\nPC Gaming Show\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\nCommunity Guidelines\n\nAffiliate Links\n\nMeet the team\n\nAbout PC Gamer\n\nPC Gamer Magazine Subscription\n\nWhy subscribe?\n\nSubscribe to the world's #1 PC gaming mag\nTry a single issue or save on a subscription\nIssues delivered straight to your door or device\n\n From\u00a335.99View Deal\n\nPC Gaming Show\nSummer Game Fest\nDune: Awakening\nElden Ring: Nightreign\n\nRecommended reading\n\nHow to get flour sand in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to get erythrite crystals in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to get spice sand in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to get spice-infused copper dust in Dune: Awakening\n\nWhere to find iron in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to find buried treasure in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to get a sandbike in Dune: Awakening\n\nDune: Awakening\n\nHow to get carbide scraps in Dune: Awakening\n\nRory Norris \n\n10 June 2025\n\nFight your way to this valuable resource.\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Funcom)\n\nLet's face it, getting an ornithopter to completely avoid the worm-infested sands of Dune: Awakening is the main goal. It's quick, it's easy, and you can haul resources back and forth. As you'd expect, though, it's expensive to craft, requiring the extremely hard-to-find carbide scraps.\n\nBelow, I'll go over the one location where you can find carbide scraps, as well as a vendor that sells it, so you can get to crafting your very own ornithopter in no time. Just be prepared to fight for it.\nHow to get carbide scraps in Dune: Awakening\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\n(Image credit: Funcom)\n\n(Image credit: Funcom)\n\nYou'll find carbide scraps in containers in the Mysa Tarill outpost, a region in the top left corner of the map, past Western Vermillius Gap, right next to the Crossroads tradepost. This makes for a convenient fast-travel location once you've visited it for the first time.\n\nRelated articles\n\nHow to get flour sand in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to get erythrite crystals in Dune: Awakening\n\nHow to get spice sand in Dune: Awakening\n\nThis area is particularly well-guarded, so bring a powerful weapon, some sturdy armour, and lots and lots of bandages. Once you've cleared it out, search every chest in the area to find a few carbide scraps, as well as the usual intel hidden in outposts.\n\nDon't fancy fighting for it? If you've got the cash to splash, then you can also buy carbide scraps for 3,500 solaris from Zoe at the Crossroads tradepost in Mysa Tarill, or from the weapon merchants in Arrakeen and Harko Village. Given how expensive this can get, I don't recommend taking this option. Try your luck in the Mysa Tarill outpost first.\nYou'll need heaps of carbide scraps and diamondine dust to build vehicles, including the prized scout ornithopter and buggy. In fact, you need 14 diamondine dust and seven carbide scraps for a complete ornithopter, so you'll likely need to clear Mysa Tarill a few times before you have what you need. It's also used in a handful of gear recipes as well, including the Adept sword, and the Regis sword and rapier.\n\nDune: Awakening guide: All our tips and tricks\nDune: Awakening best classes: Top mentor, homeworld, and caste\nDune: Awakening Trial of Aql locations: Spicy\nDune: Awakening trainer locations: Basic and advanced mentors\nDune: Awakening sandbike: Get your first ride\nDune: Awakening fast travel: Arrakis taxis\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRory Norris\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nGuides Writer\n\nRory has made the fatal error of playing way too many live service games at once, and somehow still finding time for everything in between.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Funcom)\n\nAs you progress in Dune: Awakening, you'll need ever more obscure and rare materials. Long gone are the days of taking just a few steps and mining copious amounts of copper and iron to craft everything you need to survive the sands. Better gear demands better materials, so eventually you'll need to get diamondine dust.\n\nBeing an industrial byproduct, you don't need to mine anything to get this diamondine dust, though that actually makes it somewhat more challenging, as you'll need to know exactly where to loot to find it. Below, I'll go over the one location you can get diamondine dust, as well as a vendor that sells it\u2014so long as you've got the solaris.\nHow to get diamondine dust in Dune: Awakening\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\n(Image credit: Funcom)\n\n(Image credit: Funcom)\n\nYou can find diamondine dust in containers in Mysa Tarill, a region in the top left corner of the map, past Western Vermillius Gap, right next to the Crossroads tradepost\u2014a fast-travel location.

This outpost in particular is very challenging, though, thanks to the wide open arena and enemy snipers pinning you down. But your hard work will be rewarded. Search every chest in the outpost, and you're sure to find at least a few pieces of diamondine dust.\n\nIf you've got the solaris to splash, you can also buy diamondine dust from Zoe at the Crossroads tradepost in Mysa Tarill, or from the weapon merchants in Arrakeen and Harko Village. But keep in mind that it costs 2,500 solaris for a taxi to the faction strongholds, on top of the 3,500 solaris to buy just one diamondine dust, so it's not very economical.\nAlongside carbide scraps, diamondine dust is primarily used to build vehicles, including most parts of the scout ornithopter and buggy, making it a valuable material to stock up on as soon as you can. However, it's also used in a handful of gear recipes as well, including House, Adept, and Regis weapon sets.\n\nDune: Awakening guide: All our tips and tricks\nDune: Awakening best classes: Top mentor, homeworld, and caste\nDune: Awakening Trial of Aql locations: Spicy\nDune: Awakening trainer locations: Basic and advanced mentors\nDune: Awakening sandbike: Get your first ride\nDune: Awakening fast travel: Arrakis taxis\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRory Norris\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nGuides Writer\n\nRory has made the fatal error of playing way too many live service games at once, and somehow still finding time for everything in between.

Speak to the ornithopter pilot in Griffin's Reach to unlock fast travel.Regardless, when you're at Griffin's Reach speak to the ornithopter pilot, who is in the corner of the main building, opposite the contracts board. You can ask them to fly you to one of three locations: Hagga Basin, Arrakeen, and Harko Village. Harko Village is a Harkonnen stronghold, Arrakeen is where House Atreides hole up, and Hagga Basin lists the locations you've already visited. You can select any of those to quickly fly to them. While you can't access fast travel via the main map screen, there's usually a Tradepost pretty close by, at least in the first few hours of the game.

Scott, currently awaiting trial on other charges in Milwaukee County, had authored the letters as part of a plot aimed at getting Morales Reyes deported. The two are connected because Scott allegedly robbed Morales Reyes, and the latter man is expected to testify in the upcoming criminal trial.\n\nScott already faced charges of armed robbery and aggravated battery in that case, but has also now been charged with felony witness intimidation, identity theft and bail jumping in connection to the forged letters.\n\nProsecutors say Scott admitted to police and in recorded calls from inside prison that he had written the letters, aiming to get Morales Reyes deported and to get his criminal case dismissed.\n\nMorales Reyes lives with his wife and three children in Milwaukee and has recently applied for a U visa, which is for people in the country illegally who become victims of serious crimes, his attorney Kime Abduli told the Associated Press.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s hearing, activists held a protest outside of the courtroom at Monroe and Wabash, saying they were aiming to stand up for undocumented immigrants who they say deserve to be in the United States.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are trying to make a better life for themselves they bring richness to our city they bring a richness to our neighborhoods and their hard-working people who are just trying to race families and get ahead.
