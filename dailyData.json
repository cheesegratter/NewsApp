The deliberations follow a marathon day of closing arguments in which a Manhattan prosecutor accused Trump of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d voters in the 2016 presidential election by participating in a hush money scheme meant to stifle embarrassing stories he feared would torpedo his campaign. \u201cThis case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\u201d prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors during summations that stretched from early afternoon into the evening. Trump\u2019s lawyer, by contrast, branded the star prosecution witness as the \u201cgreatest liar of all time\u201d as he proclaimed his client innocent of all charges and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal. The lawyers\u2019 dueling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility, Trump\u2019s culpability and the strength of evidence, offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury as it prepares to embark upon the momentous and historically unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It\u2019s unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment. Jurors will have the option of convicting Trump of all counts, acquitting him of all counts, or delivering a mixed verdict in which he is found guilty of some charges and not others. If they deadlock after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, Judge Juan M. Merchan may declare a mistrial. The trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments , including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her, Michael Cohen, can be trusted. \u201cPresident Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\u201d Blanche said. Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. Trump, for instance, has said he and Daniels never had sex and has repeatedly attacked Cohen as a liar. The prosecutor acknowledged that Daniels\u2019 account about the alleged 2006 encounter in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, which Trump has denied, was at times \u201ccringeworthy\u201d but he said the details she offered \u2014 including about decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump\u2019s toiletry kit \u2014 were full of touchstones \u201cthat kind of ring true.\u201d And, he said, the story matters because it \u201creinforces (Trump\u2019s) incentive to buy her silence.\u201d \u201cHer story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d Steinglass said. He told jurors: \u201cIn the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\u201d The payoff unfolded against the backdrop of the disclosure of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women sexually without their permission. Had the Daniels story emerged in the aftermath of the recording, it would have undermined his strategy of spinning away his words, Steinglass said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to appreciate this,\u201d Steinglass said. At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d Trump \u201cwas negotiating to muzzle a porn star,\u201d the prosecutor said. Blanche, who spoke first, sought to downplay the fallout by saying the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was not a \u201cdoomsday event.\u201d Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution\u2019s case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial. \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It\u2019s not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It\u2019s whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\u201d Steinglass said. Though the case featured sometimes seamy discussion of sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges concern something decidedly less flashy: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the payments. The reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family. In his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump\u2019s \u201cdeny everything\u201d approach, Blanche castigated the entire foundation of the case. He said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and rejected the prosecution\u2019s caricature of a details-oriented manager, suggesting instead that Trump was preoccupied by the presidency and not the checks he was signing. And he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference. \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\u201d Blanche said. As expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination. Mimicking the term \u201cGOAT,\u201d used primarily in sports as an acronym for \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d Blanche labeled Cohen the \u201cGLOAT\u201d \u2014 greatest liar of all time \u2014 and also called Cohen \u201cthe human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\u201d Blanche said, a reference to Cohen\u2019s relentless and often bitingly personal social media attacks on Trump and the lucrative income he has derived from books and podcasts about Trump. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L.

The 12 Manhattan residents will be tasked with reaching a unanimous verdict on each of the 34 felony counts of falsification of business records that Trump faces. Prosecutors allege he disguised the purpose of a year's worth of reimbursements to his attorney Michael Cohen, who paid $130,000 in \"hush money\" to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty. Before deliberations get underway, Justice Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing the trial, will issue crucial instructions to the jury, laying out the legal issues they must consider and the conclusions they must reach to find Trump guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge mostly sided with prosecutors during a hearing last week over what exactly those instructions will entail. On Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the case presented their closing arguments in the Manhattan courtroom where the trial has unfolded over the past six weeks. Trump's attorney Todd Blanche took direct aim at Cohen, saying his testimony was littered with lies and claiming that he acted on his own when he made the payment to Daniels. Blanche argued that there were plenty of reasons to doubt the story told by prosecutors, and said their case hinged on Cohen's unreliable testimony. Joshua Steinglass, a prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said that Cohen was far from a perfect witness, but asked jurors to focus on the documents that he said corroborate his account. He portrayed Trump as a micromanager who would not have signed $35,000 checks to Cohen if he did not know their true purpose.

The historic deliberations follow Tuesday\u2019s whirlwind of closing arguments, which stretched into the evening hours as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass accused Trump of intentionally deceiving voters by allegedly participating in a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d scheme to bury stories that might obliterate his 2016 presidential bid. Steinglass further suggested that Trump operated with a \u201ccavalier willingness\u201d to hide payoffs and did so in a way that left \u201cno paper trail.\u201d The defense approached its summation much in the same way it approached cross-examination: by targeting the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen. Defense lawyer Todd Blanche branded Trump\u2019s former lawyer as \u201cthe greatest liar of all time\u201d while urging jurors to quickly acquit his client. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. He has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were falsely logged as \u201clegal expenses\u201d to hide the true nature of the transactions. The case is the first of Trump\u2019s four indictments to reach trial and is the first-ever criminal case against a former U.S. president.

Jury deliberations in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that\u2019s intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it\u2019s hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. ANOTHER FAMOUS FACE AT THE COURTHOUSE Donald Trump will not be the only big name appearing before a judge in lower Manhattan on Wednesday \u2014 fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected to appear for a hearing related to the retrial of his landmark #MeToo-era rape case. The hearing will take place in the same courthouse where Trump is currently on trial and where Weinstein was originally convicted in 2020. Weinstein\u2019s conviction was overturned in April after the court found that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case. His retrial is slated for sometime after Labor Day. A MOTION THAT STILL HASN\u2019T BEEN DECIDED The judge in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial might have one last piece of business to address on Wednesday before jurors receive instructions and can begin deliberations. Last Monday, defense lawyers filed a motion asking the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that prosecutors had failed to prove their case and there was no evidence of falsified business records or an intent to defraud. Prosecutors rebutted that assertion, saying \u201cthe trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each element\u201d of the alleged offenses, and the case should proceed to the jury. Judge Juan M. Merchan did not indicate at the time when he would issue a decision on the request. More than a week later, it remains unclear whether he will address it before the case goes to the jury. WHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION? Jurors in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are expected to begin deliberations on Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge on the law that governs the case and what they can consider as they strive toward a verdict in the first criminal case against a former U.S. president. The panel has a weighty task ahead of them \u2014 deciding whether to convict or acquit Trump of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he\u2019s charged with. But what had to be proved for a conviction? To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors had to convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense needed to convince at least one juror that prosecutors didn\u2019t prove Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. If the jury deadlocks after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial.", "summary": "Jury deliberations in Donald Trump's criminal trial are expected to begin following a whirlwind day of closing arguments that stretched late into the evening.

After weeks of testimony from more than 20 witnesses, the piercing glare of the legal spotlight now shifts firmly to the anonymous 12-member panel that holds Trump's fate in its hands. After receiving final instructions from the judge, the jury will retire to consider a verdict that -- whichever way it goes -- will have an outsized impact on Trump, and the country as a whole. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse a $130,000 payment to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels, when her account of an alleged sexual encounter imperiled his 2016 presidential campaign. If Trump is found guilty, the political repercussions would far outweigh the seriousness of the charges as, barely five months before the presidential election, the candidate would also become a convicted criminal. In a full day of closing arguments on Tuesday, his defense team insisted the evidence for a conviction simply did not exist, while the prosecution countered that it was voluminous and inescapable. \"The defendant's intent to defraud could not be any clearer,\" said prosecutor Joshua Steinglass, urging the jurors to use their \"common sense\" and return a guilty verdict. To return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous -- one holdout means a mistrial. If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time. A conviction would not bar him from the November ballot. - 'Hatred for Trump' - In its concluding remarks to the jury, the defense has painted star prosecution witness Michael Cohen as a convicted liar consumed by \"outright hatred for Trump.\" \"There was no intent to defraud and beyond that there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election,\" said Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche. Steinglass countered that there was a mountain of corroborating evidence in addition to Cohen's testimony. Speaking to reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom Tuesday, Trump called it a \"very dangerous day for America.\" Trump chose not to testify in his defense. Instead, he used his trips to court to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail. Polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden and the verdict will inflame passions as the White House race intensifies. In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House. The New York case is the only one likely to come to trial by election day.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-andrew-kelly-afp.jpg?id=52351026&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=11%2C0%2C7%2C0\"/><br/><br/><p>Jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial begin deliberating Wednesday on whether to return the first criminal conviction of a former president -- a momentous decision that could upend the November presidential election.</p><p>After weeks of testimony from more than 20 witnesses, the piercing glare of the legal spotlight now shifts firmly to the anonymous 12-member panel that holds Trump's fate in its hands.</p><p>After receiving final instructions from the judge, the jury will retire to consider a verdict that -- whichever way it goes -- will have an outsized impact on Trump, and the country as a whole.</p><p>Trump is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse a $130,000 payment to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels, when her account of an alleged sexual encounter imperiled his 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>If Trump is found guilty,", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/jury-to-begin-deliberating-on-trump-s-fate-at-n-y-trial/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-andrew-kelly-afp.jpg?id=52351026&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C59%2C0%2C55", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:12:46", "author": "Agence France-presse", "authors": ["Agence France-presse"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.44}, {"id": 225009376, "title": "Trump\u2019s hush money case heading to jury deliberations after marathon day of closing arguments\u2014from trying to \u2018hoodwink\u2019 voters to the \u2018GLOAT\u2019", "text": "The deliberations follow a marathon day of closing arguments in which a Manhattan prosecutor accused Trump of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d voters in the 2016 presidential election by participating in a hush money scheme meant to stifle embarrassing stories he feared would torpedo his campaign. \u201cThis case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\u201d prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors during summations that stretched from early afternoon into the evening.

Former President Donald Trump arrives at Manhattan Criminal Court, Tuesday, May 28, 2024, in New ... [+] York. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson, Pool) Associated Press Key Facts After several days of jury selection last month, the judge and lawyers for both sides assembled a 12-person jury consisting of seven men and five women, including six who are married and three with children (six alternate jurors were also selected). All but three indicated during jury selection they had a college education, and they come from a wide array of professional backgrounds, according to multiple reports\u2014including two lawyers, two educators, a software engineer, a security engineer, a physical therapist, a salesman, an investment banker, a businessman, a product manager and a retired wealth manager. A majority are not native New Yorkers, with nine indicating they lived somewhere else before coming to New York, and two previously lived outside the U.S.\u2014the jury foreman lived in Ireland while another juror lived in Lebanon. At least five indicated they don\u2019t follow the news closely: One juror who works as a teacher, for instance, indicated her colleagues had strong opinions on Trump, but she appreciated his candor, didn\u2019t have a strong opinion either way, tried to stay out of politics and doesn\u2019t like the news, according to press reports from jury selection. While all the jurors insisted they believed they could be impartial, two expressed more significant disagreements with the former president\u2014one juror acknowledged she did not agree with \u201ca lot of his politics and his decisions as a president\u201d but believed she could be a \u201ctotally impartial juror,\u201d while another said she didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s persona, but believed it didn\u2019t impede her from being impartial. When asked about their opinions on Trump, the remaining jurors all indicated they either had no strong opinions, or were ambivalent\u2014agreeing with some things but disagreeing with others. Where Do The Jurors Get Their News? The New York Times was the most frequently mentioned source of news among the jurors, according to pool reports, among frequently cited mainstream outlets like the Wall Street Journal. Social media was also frequently cited. One juror who works as an investment banker indicated he kept up to date with a variety of sources, frequently seeing Trump\u2019s Truth Social posts via X, while also following former Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2014a witness against Trump in the hush money case\u2014and longtime Trump ally Kellyanne Conway. Crucial Quote \"I don't like some of my co-workers,\u201d said one juror about her feelings on Trump, according to pool reports. \u201cBut I can hear him out and understand his point of view and understand his issues.\" Surprising Fact Two of the jurors are attorneys: one a civil litigator and the other a corporate lawyer. Legal experts have noted it\u2019s unusual for one lawyer, let alone two, to be seated on a jury, according to Politico. Former Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN lawyers can sometimes become very strong voices on the jury because of their background and knowledge\u2014but they might also cut a jury cut through difficult technical language. What To Watch For There\u2019s no time limit for jurors to reach a verdict, but they will need to come to a unanimous conclusion. They could find Trump guilty of all, some or none of the counts. If they can\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict, Merchan could declare a hung jury and a mistrial. Key Background Prosecutors and attorneys for Trump wrapped up their cases in court on Tuesday. Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, in connection to alleged efforts to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence on an alleged affair with Trump, which Trump has long denied. Finding a jury was an exhaustive process in a case that has made history as the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Judge Juan Merchan culled through nearly 200 potential jurors, largely removing those who claimed they couldn\u2019t be impartial, and allowing each side 10 \u201dstrikes\u201d \u2014- allowing them to dismiss a juror without giving a reason. Trump, the Republican candidate for president, had said the Manhattan venue was unfair, given its traditionally Democratic leanings, and called for it to be moved to the more right-leaning Staten Island. As the Washington Post reported, a large number of jury candidates voiced complaints about Trump, with Trump at one point muttering a rebuttal\u2014which prompted a rebuke from Merchan, warning against jury intimidation. Tangent Judge Juan Merchan has been protective of the juror\u2019s identities throughout the case, given the potential for backlash or harassment\u2014Merchan has restricted access to jurors\u2019 identities and has ordered the media to be cautious about reporting on identifying features. Prior to the seating of the jury, two previously seated jurors had been dismissed\u2014one over concern about privacy. Follow me on Twitter. Send me a secure tip.

The historic deliberations follow Tuesday\u2019s whirlwind of closing arguments, which stretched into the evening hours as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass accused Trump of intentionally deceiving voters by allegedly participating in a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d scheme to bury stories that might obliterate his 2016 presidential bid. Steinglass further suggested that Trump operated with a \u201ccavalier willingness\u201d to hide payoffs and did so in a way that left \u201cno paper trail.\u201d The defense approached its summation much in the same way it approached cross-examination: by targeting the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen. Defense lawyer Todd Blanche branded Trump\u2019s former lawyer as \u201cthe greatest liar of all time\u201d while urging jurors to quickly acquit his client. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. He has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were falsely logged as \u201clegal expenses\u201d to hide the true nature of the transactions. The case is the first of Trump\u2019s four indictments to reach trial and is the first-ever criminal case against a former U.S. president.

The jury in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial is comprised of 18 Manhattan residents. The main jury includes seven men and five women. There are also six alternate jurors who\u2019ve listened to the testimony, but won\u2019t join in the deliberations unless one of the main jurors needs to drop out or is removed. The jury represents a diverse cross-section of the borough and come from various professional backgrounds, including a sales professional, a software engineer, a security engineer, a teacher, a speech therapist, multiple lawyers, an investment banker and a retired wealth manager. Jurors\u2019 names are being kept from the public. A RECAP OF TESTIMONY JURORS HEARD IN THE CASE Across more than four weeks of testimony, prosecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Among the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses: Trump\u2019s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, porn actor Stormy Daniels, tabloid publisher David Pecker and lawyer Keith Davidson, who negotiated hush money deals for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen testified that he paid $130,000 in hush money to Daniels at Trump\u2019s behest weeks before the 2016 election to keep her quiet about her claims of a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. Trump denies the encounter took place. Cohen also said Trump was involved in an arrangement to repay him and log the payments as legal expenses. Daniels gave an at-times graphic account of the alleged encounter. Pecker testified about agreeing to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign by tipping Cohen off to negative stories, including Daniels\u2019 claim. Davidson talked about negotiating the deals and what he said was Cohen\u2019s frustration after the Daniels deal that Trump still hadn\u2019t repaid him. The defense\u2019s big witness was attorney Robert Costello, who testified last Monday and Tuesday about negotiating to represent Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s properties in 2018. HOW WILL THE JURY DELIBERATIONS WORK? Jury deliberations in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that\u2019s intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it\u2019s hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. ANOTHER FAMOUS FACE AT THE COURTHOUSE Donald Trump will not be the only big name appearing before a judge in lower Manhattan on Wednesday \u2014 fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected to appear for a hearing related to the retrial of his landmark #MeToo-era rape case. The hearing will take place in the same courthouse where Trump is currently on trial and where Weinstein was originally convicted in 2020. Weinstein\u2019s conviction was overturned in April after the court found that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case. His retrial is slated for sometime after Labor Day. A MOTION THAT STILL HASN\u2019T BEEN DECIDED The judge in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial might have one last piece of business to address on Wednesday before jurors receive instructions and can begin deliberations. Last Monday, defense lawyers filed a motion asking the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that prosecutors had failed to prove their case and there was no evidence of falsified business records or an intent to defraud. Prosecutors rebutted that assertion, saying \u201cthe trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each element\u201d of the alleged offenses, and the case should proceed to the jury. Judge Juan M. Merchan did not indicate at the time when he would issue a decision on the request. More than a week later, it remains unclear whether he will address it before the case goes to the jury. WHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION? Jurors in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are expected to begin deliberations on Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge on the law that governs the case and what they can consider as they strive toward a verdict in the first criminal case against a former U.S. president. The panel has a weighty task ahead of them \u2014 deciding whether to convict or acquit Trump of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he\u2019s charged with. But what had to be proved for a conviction? To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors had to convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense needed to convince at least one juror that prosecutors didn\u2019t prove Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. If the jury deadlocks after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial.", "summary": "Jury deliberations in Donald Trump \u2018s criminal hush money trial are expected to begin Wednesday after the panel receives instructions from the judge on the law governing the case and what they can take into account in evaluating the former president\u2019s guilt or innocence.", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/29/the-latest-trumps-criminal-trial-to-enter-deliberations-phase-after-jury-receives-instructions/", "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Trump_Hush_Money_06108.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:03:10", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.195}, {"id": 225024270, "title": "Jury in Trump's hush money case will begin deliberations after hearing instructions from the judge", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin deliberations Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge on the law and the factors they may consider as they strive to reach a verdict in the first criminal case against a former American president. The deliberations follow a marathon day of closing arguments in which a Manhattan prosecutor accused Trump of trying to ''hoodwink'' voters in the 2016 presidential election by participating in a hush money scheme meant to stifle embarrassing stories he feared would torpedo his campaign. ''This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,'' prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors during summations that stretched from early afternoon into the evening. Trump's lawyer, by contrast, branded the star prosecution witness as the ''greatest liar of all time'' as he proclaimed his client innocent of all charges and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal. The lawyers' dueling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility, Trump's culpability and the strength of evidence, offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury as it prepares to embark upon the momentous and historically unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment. Jurors will have the option of convicting Trump of all counts, acquitting him of all counts, or delivering a mixed verdict in which he is found guilty of some charges and not others. If they deadlock after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, Judge Juan M. Merchan may declare a mistrial. The trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments, including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her, Michael Cohen, can be trusted. ''President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said. Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. Trump, for instance, has said he and Daniels never had sex and has repeatedly attacked Cohen as a liar. The prosecutor acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, which Trump has denied, was at times ''cringeworthy'' but he said the details she offered \u2014 including about decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit \u2014 were full of touchstones ''that kind of ring true.'' And, he said, the story matters because it ''reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\" ''Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,'' Steinglass said. He told jurors: ''In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.'' The payoff unfolded against the backdrop of the disclosure of a 2005 ''Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women sexually without their permission. Had the Daniels story emerged in the aftermath of the recording, it would have undermined his strategy of spinning away his words, Steinglass said. \"It's critical to appreciate this,'' Steinglass said. At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as ''locker room talk,'' Trump ''was negotiating to muzzle a porn star,'' the prosecutor said. Blanche, who spoke first, sought to downplay the fallout by saying the ''Access Hollywood'' tape was not a ''doomsday event.'' Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial. ''It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,'' Steinglass said. Though the case featured sometimes seamy discussion of sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges concern something decidedly less flashy: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the payments.

Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, all tied to the former president\u2019s role in a hush-money payment to the porn star, Stormy Daniels. The charges do not involve the hush deal itself but Mr. Trump\u2019s reimbursements for it to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who gave $130,000 to Ms. Daniels to buy her silence days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors said that the repayments were deliberately mislabeled as \u201clegal expenses\u201d in business ledgers to hide the deal. If convicted, Mr. Trump faces probation or up to four years in prison. That payoff was not the only such deal that prosecutors highlighted with the 20 witnesses they called to the stand. Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Trump had orchestrated a broader scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by directing his allies to purchase damaging stories about him to keep them under wraps. The defense called two witnesses. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He also assailed the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, for bringing the charges, accusing him of carrying out a politically motivated witch hunt, and he has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan. Catch up on the trial here. The accusations The charges trace to the $130,000 payment to Ms. Daniels, which Mr. Cohen testified he had made at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction. Ms. Daniels also testified about her account of having sex with Mr. Trump, saying it happened in 2006 in Nevada after they met at a celebrity golf tournament. While serving as the commander in chief a decade later, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and the way he did so constituted fraud, prosecutors said. In internal records, Mr. Trump\u2019s company classified the repayment as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, the prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional, too. Mr. Trump\u2019s defense team has said there was a valid oral retainer that had not been recorded on paper. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 counts involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump\u2019s trust. Additional hush payments Mr. Bragg\u2019s office linked Mr. Trump to three hush-money deals that prosecutors argued were made to bury negative news during his presidential campaign. Two of the deals were paid for by The National Enquirer, which helped promote Mr. Trump during the campaign while also suppressing negative headlines about him, its former publisher testified. The first involved the tabloid\u2019s payment of $30,000 to a former Trump Tower doorman who claimed to know that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false. The Enquirer also paid Karen McDougal, Playboy\u2019s Playmate of the Year in 1998 who, during the 2016 campaign, wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump beginning in 2006. She reached a $150,000 agreement with the tabloid, which bought the rights to her story to suppress it \u2014 a practice known as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d The felony charges Falsifying business records in New York State can be a misdemeanor, but it can become a felony if prosecutors prove that the records were falsified to conceal another crime. Mr. Bragg has accused Mr. Trump of concealing a federal campaign finance violation and a state election-law crime. Those, prosecutors say, involve the hush-money payoffs to Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal. The payments, they argue, were illegal donations to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Prosecutors did not have to charge Mr. Trump with a secondary crime or prove that he committed it, but they had to show to the jurors that there was intent to \u201ccommit or conceal\u201d a second crime. The witnesses Much of Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses, including former White House aides such as Hope Hicks. The defense argued that Mr. Trump was a victim of extortion, led by Mr. Cohen. His lawyers portrayed Mr. Cohen as a Trump-hating liar, pointing out that he and the former president had a falling-out years ago. The defense\u2019s main witness was a lawyer linked to Mr. Trump\u2019s circle, Robert J. Costello, who in 2018 had acted as Mr. Cohen\u2019s back channel to Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team. Defense lawyers used his fractious testimony to paint Mr. Cohen as untrustworthy. Mr. Trump did not take the stand. Justice Merchan Justice Merchan is a veteran judge known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist. The judge issued a gag order to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol. And yet the former president continued to post articles with pictures of the justice\u2019s daughter. In the trial\u2019s early days, Justice Merchan fined Mr. Trump $10,000 for 10 violations of that order. The maximum sentence The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category of felonies in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could throw Mr. Trump behind bars. But nothing in the law requires Justice Merchan to imprison Mr. Trump if he\u2019s convicted by a jury. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.

The deliberations follow a marathon day of closing arguments in which a Manhattan prosecutor accused Trump of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d voters in the 2016 presidential election by participating in a hush money scheme meant to stifle embarrassing stories he feared would torpedo his campaign. \u201cThis case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\u201d prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors during summations that stretched from early afternoon into the evening. Trump's lawyer, by contrast, branded the star prosecution witness as the \u201cgreatest liar of all time\u201d as he proclaimed his client innocent of all charges and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal. The lawyers' dueling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility, Trump's culpability and the strength of evidence, offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury as it prepares to embark upon the momentous and historically unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It\u2019s unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment. Jurors will have the option of convicting Trump of all counts, acquitting him of all counts, or delivering a mixed verdict in which he is found guilty of some charges and not others. If they deadlock after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, Judge Juan M. Merchan may declare a mistrial. The trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments, including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her, Michael Cohen, can be trusted. \u201cPresident Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\u201d Blanche said. Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. Trump, for instance, has said he and Daniels never had sex and has repeatedly attacked Cohen as a liar. The prosecutor acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, which Trump has denied, was at times \u201ccringeworthy\u201d but he said the details she offered \u2014 including about decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump\u2019s toiletry kit \u2014 were full of touchstones \u201cthat kind of ring true.\u201d And, he said, the story matters because it \u201creinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\u201d \u201cHer story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d Steinglass said. He told jurors: \u201cIn the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\u201d The payoff unfolded against the backdrop of the disclosure of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women sexually without their permission. Had the Daniels story emerged in the aftermath of the recording, it would have undermined his strategy of spinning away his words, Steinglass said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to appreciate this,\u201d Steinglass said. At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d Trump \u201cwas negotiating to muzzle a porn star,\u201d the prosecutor said. Blanche, who spoke first, sought to downplay the fallout by saying the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was not a \u201cdoomsday event.\u201d Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial. \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It\u2019s not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It\u2019s whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\u201d Steinglass said. Though the case featured sometimes seamy discussion of sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges concern something decidedly less flashy: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the payments. The reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family. In his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \u201cdeny everything\u201d approach, Blanche castigated the entire foundation of the case. He said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and rejected the prosecution\u2019s caricature of a details-oriented manager, suggesting instead that Trump was preoccupied by the presidency and not the checks he was signing.

The deliberations are poised to commence after judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law. Merchan\u2019s directives on the law are intended on guiding jurors about how they are supposed to weigh the case. The former president is charged with falsifying business records in relation to paying off adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Trump is the first US president, former or present, to face a criminal trial. Manhattan prosecutors allege that Trump\u2019s then attorney, Michael Cohen, shuttled $130,000 to Daniels days before the election, so that her claim of an extramarital sexual liaison wouldn\u2019t go public and tank his chances at the polls. This next step of Trump\u2019s trial marks a pivotal moment. If jurors reach a verdict, they will determine whether he is guilty or not guilty. If Trump is found guilty, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate faces the prospect of jail \u2013 albeit unlikely \u2013 when he\u2019s sentenced. Trump has denied the charge against him. Trump also faces three other criminal cases: one for trying to influence the 2020 election in Georgia, another for his conduct around the January 6 Capitol attack, and a third one involving his treatment of sensitive documents after he left the White House. These other three cases have been pushed back and it\u2019s unlikely that any would conclude before the November election. Trump\u2019s legal woes do not appear to have affected him in the polls. He still boasts a narrow edge over Joe Biden in some polls and is proving strong in some key states that are key to winning the race. On Tuesday, the defense and prosecution presented their summations. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass insisted that the case was about far more than paying off Daniels. Rather, Steinglass said, Trump\u2019s plot with Cohen and tabloid honcho David Pecker in summer 2015 \u2013 where the scandal sheet publisher said he\u2019d keep an eye out for damaging information about the then-candidate \u2013 deprived Americans of true choice at the ballot box. \u201cThree rich and powerful men, high up in Trump Tower, tried to become even more powerful by controlling the information that reached voters,\u201d Steinglass said. \u201cThe value of this corrupt bargain. It turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions to the Trump campaign. This scheme cooked up by these men, at this time, could very well be what got Donald Trump elected.\u201d \u201cIn simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive,\u201d Steinglass said at one point. Trump\u2019s defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, insisted that Cohen was a liar and that even if there were a conspiracy, it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if there was a conspiracy to try and win an election,\u201d Blanche said of the alleged scheme involving Trump, who is accused elsewhere of election meddling and fostering civil unrest to stop Biden from taking office. \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate.\u201d Blanche phrased this as a hypothetical \u2013 he didn\u2019t admit there was a conspiracy and in fact, denied one. But, even if there were, Blanche insisted it was business as usual. \u201cMany politicians work with the media to try and promote their image,\u201d Blanche said, telling jurors at one point that in order for it to be a legal problem, \u201cyou have to find that this effort was done by unlawful means\u201d.", "summary": "<p>If jurors reach verdict after judge Juan Merchan\u2019s directives on the law, they\u2019ll determine whether ex-president is guilty or not guilty</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/may/29/jury-trump-hush-money-trial-latest-updates\">Trump trial \u2013 live updates</a></li></ul><p>Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York inches towards its concluding stages Wednesday with the expected start of jury deliberations.</p><p>The deliberations are poised to commence after judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law.

Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels and illicitly influence the 2016 presidential election. Who said what Trump lawyer Todd Blanche \"had a clear message for jurors: The prosecution's case rests on the testimony of Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen, and he can't be believed,\" The Associated Press said. He called Cohen \"literally the greatest liar of all time,\" and showed jurors a PowerPoint labeled \"Case Turns on Cohen.\" Blanche also argued prosecutors had Daniels testify about her sexual encounter with Trump to \"embarrass\" him. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said the \"messy\" and \"uncomfortable\" Daniels testimony showed why, after a recording of Trump boasting of sexual assault emerged right before the election, he agreed to secretly pay her the $130,000 in hush money allegedly disguised as legal fees. \"Stormy Daniels is the motive,\" he said. \"This case is about Donald Trump,\" not Cohen, who is merely a useful \"tour guide\" through the mountains of hard evidence, Steinglass added. You don't have to like him, but \"like all fixers, Cohen knew where the bodies were buried.\" What next? Judge Juan Merchan will give the 12 jurors their instructions Wednesday, then they \"could take anywhere from a few hours to weeks to reach a verdict,\" The New York Times said.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and MICHELLE L. PRICE (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jurors in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are expected to begin deliberations Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge on the law and the factors they may consider as they strive to reach a verdict in the first criminal case against a former American president. \u201cIt is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours,\u201d Judge Juan M. Merchan told jurors. The deliberations follow a marathon day of closing arguments in which a Manhattan prosecutor accused Trump of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d voters in the 2016 presidential election by participating in a hush money scheme meant to stifle embarrassing stories he feared would torpedo his campaign. \u201cThe name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man who benefited the most: the defendant, former President Donald Trump,\u201d prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors. Trump\u2019s lawyer, by contrast, branded the star prosecution witness as the \u201cgreatest liar of all time\u201d as he proclaimed his client innocent of all charges and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal. The lawyers\u2019 dueling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility, Trump\u2019s culpability and the strength of evidence, offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury as it prepares to embark upon the momentous and historically unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It\u2019s unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment. Jurors will have the option of convicting Trump of all counts, acquitting him of all counts, or delivering a mixed verdict in which he is found guilty of some charges and not others. If they deadlock after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, Merchan may declare a mistrial. To convict Trump, jurors must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely and did so with the intent to deceive and the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Under the law, if they do not find that prosecutors have proven one or both of those elements, they must acquit Trump. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide breaches of campaign finance law and a violation of a state election law alleging a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election. The trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments, including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her, Michael Cohen, can be trusted. \u201cPresident Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\u201d Blanche said. With the start of deliberations just hours away, Trump posted another all-caps rant about the trial, the judge and Cohen on his social media network before leaving Trump Tower for the courthouse Wednesday morning. He called it a \u201cKangaroo Court!\u201d and falsely claimed that the judge barred him from defending himself by claiming that his alleged actions were taken on the advice of his then-lawyer, Cohen. Trump\u2019s lawyers in March notified the court that they would not rely on that defense. \u201cThere was no crime, except for the bum that got caught stealing from me!\u201d Trump said, apparently referring to Cohen. He added, again in all capital letters, \u201cIn God We Trust!\u201d Steinglass sought during his cloing arguments to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. The prosecutor acknowledged that Daniels\u2019 account about the alleged 2006 encounter in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, which Trump has denied, was at times \u201ccringeworthy.\u201d But he said the details she offered \u2014 including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump\u2019s toiletry kit \u2014 were full of touchstones \u201cthat kind of ring true.\u201d And, he said, the story matters because it \u201creinforces (Trump\u2019s) incentive to buy her silence.\u201d \u201cHer story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d Steinglass said. He told jurors: \u201cIn the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\u201d The payoff unfolded against the backdrop of the disclosure of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women sexually without their permission. Had the Daniels story emerged in the aftermath of the recording, it would have undermined his strategy of spinning away his words, Steinglass said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to appreciate this,\u201d Steinglass said. At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d Trump \u201cwas negotiating to muzzle a porn star,\u201d the prosecutor said. Blanche, who spoke first, sought to downplay the fallout by saying the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was not a \u201cdoomsday event.\u201d Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution\u2019s case did not rest solely on Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial. \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It\u2019s not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It\u2019s whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\u201d Steinglass said. Though the case featured sometimes seamy discussion of sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges concern something decidedly less flashy: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the payments. The reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family. In his own hourslong address to the jury, Blanche castigated the entire foundation of the case. He said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement, and he rejected the prosecution\u2019s caricature of a details-oriented manager. He suggested instead that Trump was preoccupied by the presidency and not the checks he was signing. And he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference. \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\u201d Blanche said. As expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen. Mimicking the term \u201cGOAT,\u201d used primarily in sports as an acronym for \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d Blanche labeled Cohen the \u201cGLOAT\u201d \u2014 greatest liar of all time \u2014 and called Cohen \u201cthe human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\u201d Blanche said, a reference to Cohen\u2019s relentless and often bitingly personal social media attacks on Trump and the lucrative income he has derived from books and podcasts about Trump. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of former President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.", "summary": "Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.

The 12-person jury will be tasked with ruling on 34 counts against the former president related to falsifying business documents in an attempt to cover up an alleged affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied that the affair took place. Merchan's instructions will detail what the jury must consider as it weighs its decision. The jury must reach a unanimous decision. When a decision is reached it will be read to the court. Trump did not speak to the press on his way into the courtroom on Wednesday morning, something he has typically done throughout the trial. Closing arguments wrapped up Tuesday afternoon after more than 20 witnesses gave testimony throughout the trial. Daniels and Trump's former \"fixer\" Michael Cohen were the star witnesses for the prosecution. Defense attorney Todd Blanche attempted to discredit Cohen, alleging that his testimony did not contain any facts. He repeatedly called Trump's former attorney a liar while downplaying Trump's role and knowledge of any hush-money payments. Blanche also urged that the trial is not about whether Trump had an affair but about business documents that he says are all legitimate. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass argued that Cohen and Daniels gave context to a \"catch and kill\" scheme that ultimately may have helped Trump get elected in 2016. He showed the jury a series of phone calls involving the key players in the scheme, including Cohen, former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and publisher David Pecker.

Former President Donald Trump raises his fist as he arrives for his criminal trial at Manhattan ... [+] Criminal Court on May 29 in New York City. Getty Images Key Facts Jurors started deliberating at approximately 11:30 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday after Judge Juan Merchan delivered the jury instructions, following closing arguments on Tuesday that stretched into the evening hours. Merchan instructed the jury to base their verdict based only on the evidence and not on any personal biases, and they must find there\u2019s proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records as a way to cover up efforts to \u201cconspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means\u201d\u2014which makes the falsifying of records a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. Trump has been indicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records based on reimbursement checks he sent to ex-attorney Michael Cohen in 2017, after Cohen paid adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 right before the 2016 election to silence her allegations of an affair with Trump (which the ex-president has denied). Trump\u2019s lawyers have sought to discredit Cohen, who testified Trump was aware of both the payment to Daniels and the reimbursement scheme, with attorney Todd Blanche decrying him in closing arguments as \u201cthe MVP of liars\u201d and claiming Cohen \u201ctold [jurors] a number of things from the witness stand that were lies.\u201d Prosecutors countered that argument on Tuesday, telling jurors there\u2019s corroborating phone records and other evidence to back up Cohen\u2019s testimony and arguing that Trump hired Cohen specifically \u201cfor the same qualities that his attorneys now urge you to reject his testimony because of\u201d\u2014namely that he would \u201clie and cheat on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf.\u201d What We Don\u2019t Know How long it will take the jury to deliberate. Court watchers cited by Politico Wednesday speculated a decision will come sooner rather than later\u2014either on Wednesday or by the end of the week at the latest. But ultimately it\u2019s still too early to say when there could be a verdict or what the jury will do, and jurors can take as long as they need. What To Watch For The jury will decide to either acquit or convict Trump on some or all of the charges, or the case could end in a hung jury if they can\u2019t reach a unanimous decision. If Trump\u2019s convicted, the charges against him are each punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 per offense and/or up to four years in prison. That means Trump faces up to $170,000 in fines and 136 years in prison if he were convicted on every count\u2014though legal experts believe it would be unlikely, but not unheard of, for Trump to go to prison as a first-time offender. Chief Critic Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, railed against the case in a series of Truth Social posts before proceedings began on Wednesday, decrying the so-called \u201cKANGAROO COURT\u201d and the length of prosecutors\u2019 closing arguments and exclaiming about his hush money deal with Daniels, \u201cNDA\u2019s ARE TOTALLY LEGAL AND ACCEPTED!\u201d The ex-president did not make any comments to reporters before he entered the courtroom, as he typically does. Key Background Trump\u2019s Manhattan trial marks the first of the ex-president\u2019s four criminal cases to go to trial, and the first time a former or sitting president has been tried on criminal charges. He was indicted in March 2023 following a yearslong investigation, with prosecutors alleging he falsified records by falsely labeling his reimbursement checks to Cohen as being for legal services. Trump has pleaded not guilty and his attorneys have maintained his innocence in court, arguing the checks for Cohen were for his legal work for the then-president and were thus correctly labeled. Cohen served as the trial\u2019s key witness, spending four days on the stand as he testified Trump personally approved his payment to Daniels and was present during a meeting in which then-Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg told Cohen the reimbursement checks would be labeled as being for legal services. The jury\u2019s deliberations come after Trump has also already been punished during the trial for violating a gag order that bars him from speaking about witnesses, jurors and others involved with the case, with Merchan ordering him to pay $1,000 for each of his ten violations.

It is yours,\u201d Judge Juan M. Merchan told jurors. The deliberations follow a marathon day of closing arguments in which a Manhattan prosecutor accused Trump of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d voters in the 2016 presidential election by participating in a hush money scheme meant to stifle embarrassing stories he feared would torpedo his campaign. \"The name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man who benefited the most: the defendant, former President Donald Trump,\u201d prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors. Trump's lawyer, by contrast, branded the prosecution's star witness as the \u201cgreatest liar of all time\u201d as he proclaimed his client innocent of all charges and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal. The lawyers' dueling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility, Trump's culpability and the strength of evidence, offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury as it prepares to embark on the momentous and historically unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It\u2019s unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment. Jurors will have the option of convicting Trump of all counts, acquitting him of all counts, or delivering a mixed verdict in which he is found guilty of some charges and not others. If they deadlock after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, Merchan may declare a mistrial. To convict Trump, jurors must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely and did so with the intent to deceive and the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Under the law, if they do not find that prosecutors have proved one or both of those elements, they must acquit Trump. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide breaches of campaign finance law and a violation of a state election law alleging a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election. The trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments, including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her, Michael Cohen, can be trusted. \u201cPresident Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said. With the start of deliberations just hours away, Trump posted another all-caps rant about the trial, the judge and Cohen on his social media network before leaving Trump Tower for the courthouse Wednesday morning. He called it a \u201cKangaroo Court!\u201d and falsely claimed that the judge barred him from defending himself by claiming that his alleged actions were taken on the advice of his then-lawyer, Cohen. Trump\u2019s lawyers in March notified the court that they would not rely on that defense. \u201cThere was no crime, except for the bum that got caught stealing from me!\u201d Trump said, apparently referring to Cohen. He added, again in all capital letters, \u201cIn God We Trust!\u201d Steinglass sought during his closing arguments to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. The prosecutor acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, which Trump has denied, was at times \u201ccringeworthy.\u201d But he said the details she offered \u2014 including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump\u2019s toiletry kit \u2014 were full of touchstones \u201cthat kind of ring true.\u201d And, he said, the story matters because it \u201creinforces [Trump's] incentive to buy her silence.\" \u201cHer story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d Steinglass said. He told jurors: \u201cIn the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\u201d The payoff unfolded against the backdrop of the disclosure of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\" recording in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women sexually without their permission. Had the Daniels story emerged in the aftermath of the recording, it would have undermined his strategy of spinning away his words, Steinglass said. \"It\u2019s critical to appreciate this,\u201d Steinglass said. At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d Trump \u201cwas negotiating to muzzle a porn star,\u201d the prosecutor said. Blanche, who spoke first, sought to downplay the fallout by saying the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was not a \u201cdoomsday event.\u201d Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial. \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It\u2019s not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It\u2019s whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\u201d Steinglass said. Though the case featured sometimes seamy discussion of sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges concern something decidedly less flashy: reimbursement checks Trump gave Cohen for the payments. The reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family. In his own hours-long summation to the jury, Blanche castigated the entire foundation of the case. He said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement, and he rejected the prosecution\u2019s caricature of a details-oriented manager. He suggested instead that Trump was preoccupied by the presidency and not paying attention to the checks he was signing. And he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference. \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\u201d Blanche said. As expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen. Mimicking the term \u201cGOAT,\u201d used primarily in sports as an acronym for \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d Blanche labeled Cohen the \u201cGLOAT\" \u2014 greatest liar of all time \u2014 and called Cohen \u201cthe human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\u201d Blanche said, a reference to Cohen's relentless and often bitingly personal social media attacks on Trump and the income he has derived from books and podcasts about Trump.

A motorcade brought the current GOP nominee from Trump Tower, but he did not address reporters as he typically has been doing upon arrival. However, as he has been doing for weeks, Trump posted on Truth Social before hitting the road. \u201cKANGAROO COURT!,\u201d he posted Wednesday. \u201cTHERE WAS NO CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THE BUM THAT GOT CAUGHT STEALING FROM ME! \u2026 IN GOD WE TRUST!\u201d The \u201cBUM\u201d in this case was a reference to Michael Cohen, the prosecution witness and former Trump lawyer who allegedly arranged a hush-money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the late stages of the 2016 election. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, claims there was no payment, and he and his legal team made great efforts to paint Cohen as a serial liar throughout the process. Trump was threatened with jail time and fined multiple times in April for violating a gag order by Judge Manuel Merchan meant to prevent the former president from attacking jurors, witnesses and court staff in interviews and on social media. It wasn\u2019t immediately known whether prosecutors or the judge would flag his Wednesday morning posts for potential sanctions. In giving his instructions, Merchan reminded jurors of their responsibility, underscoring that they are to set aside any personal biases. \u201cAs a juror, you are asked to make a very important decision about another member of the community,\u201d telling them to \u201cset aside any personal bias you may have in favor of or against\u201d Trump and decide the case \u201cfairly based on the evidence of the law.\u201d The panel is made up of 18 Manhattan residents, six of whom are alternates. The seated jury includes seven men and five women from various professional backgrounds including several lawyers, an investment banker, a software engineer, a teacher and a retired wealth manager, the Associated Press reported. The trial saw 22 witnesses testify \u2013 just two for the defense \u2013 across more than four weeks of testimony. Besides Cohen and Daniels, other witnesses included tabloid publisher David Pecker and lawyer Keith Davidson, who testified that he negotiated hush money deals for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump faces 34 felony charges of falsifying business records with the intent to violate federal campaign finance limits, influence the 2016 election and commit tax fraud.

Judge Juan Merchan told the jury that the burden of proof is on the prosecution and not Trump, while noting that Trump not testifying in the case cannot be used as a factor for determining whether he is guilty or innocent \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d However, Merchan affirmed that the jury need not agree on what the other crime is that Trump allegedly sought to conceal when he allegedly falsified documents. \u201cMerchan just delivered the coup de grace instruction,\u201d George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said while listening to instructions from within the courtroom. Merchan said the jurors \u201ccan disagree on what the crime was among the three choices\u201d presented by prosecutors, Turley noted, which include violations of tax laws, falsification of other business records, or violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act, known as FECA. \u201cThus, this means that they could split 4-4-4 and he will still treat them as unanimous,\u201d Turley added. Although Merchan said that the jury must be unanimous in deciding whether Trump is guilty on each count of falsification of business records, legal experts in the room suggested there does not appear to be much flexibility for a mixed verdict, or a finding that Trump was guilty or innocent of some but not all charges. \u201c34 guilty verdicts or 34 not guilty verdicts or a hung jury. I cannot foresee a verdict with some counts as guilty and others as not,\u201d former federal prosecutor Trey Gowdy said. Merchan told the jurors that reasonable doubt does not mean having no doubts at all, explaining that \u201cthere are very few things in this world that are known without some uncertainty.\u201d But he gave a caveat that for the jury, \u201cit is not sufficient to conclude the defendant is probably guilty.\u201d The judge also referenced the witnesses brought by the prosecution in the case, namely former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who made the $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that prosecutors say was concealed through the alleged business record falsifications at issue. Merchan said that Cohen is legally viewed as an \u201caccomplice\u201d in Trump\u2019s case, and that they may not convict Trump solely on Cohen\u2019s testimony. \u201cOur law is especially concerned about the testimony of an accomplice\u2026 particularly when the accomplice has received, expects or hopes for a benefit in exchange for their testimony,\u201d Merchan said. In other words, even if jurors find Cohen\u2019s testimony believable, despite his history of perjury in the courtroom, they \u201cmay not convict the defendant solely based on that testimony unless you find it is corroborated by other evidence.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER At the end of instructions, Merchan explained there is a laptop they will access to view all the evidence during deliberations.

PRICE (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jury deliberations began Wednesday in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, putting the outcome of the historic case in the hands of a dozen New Yorkers who have vowed to be fair and impartial in the face of their unprecedented task. The jury of seven men and five women was sent to a private room just before 11:30 a.m. to begin weighing a verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. The jurors\u2019 discussions will be secret, though they can send notes to the judge asking to rehear testimony or see evidence. That\u2019s also how they will notify the court of a verdict, or if they are unable to reach one. \u201cIt is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours,\u201d Judge Juan M. Merchan told jurors. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records at his company in connection with an alleged scheme to hide potentially embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 Republican presidential election campaign. The charge, a felony, arises from reimbursements paid to then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen after he made a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to silence her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump is accused of misrepresenting Cohen\u2019s reimbursements as legal expenses to hide that they were tied to a hush money payment. Trump has pleaded not guilty and contends the Cohen payments were for legitimate legal services. To convict Trump, jurors must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely and did so with the intent to deceive and the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Under the law, if they do not find that prosecutors have proven one or both of those elements, they must acquit Trump. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide breaches of campaign finance law and a violation of a state election law alleging a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election. Just hours before the start of deliberations, Trump posted another all-caps rant about the trial, the judge and Cohen on his social media network before leaving Trump Tower for the courthouse Wednesday morning. He called it a \u201cKangaroo Court!\u201d and falsely claimed that the judge barred him from defending himself by claiming that his alleged actions were taken on the advice of his then-lawyer, Cohen. Trump\u2019s lawyers in March notified the court that they would not rely on that defense. \u201cThere was no crime, except for the bum that got caught stealing from me!\u201d Trump said, apparently referring to Cohen. He added, again in all capital letters, \u201cIn God We Trust!\u201d The jurors \u2014 a diverse cross-section of Manhattan residents and professional backgrounds \u2014 often appeared riveted by testimony in the trial, including from Cohen and Daniels. Many took notes and watched intently as witnesses answered questions from Manhattan prosecutors and Trump\u2019s lawyers. Jurors started deliberating after hearing final pitches from the prosecution and defense in the form of closing arguments and after getting instructed in the law by the Merchan, who offered some guidance on factors the panel can use to assess witness testimony, including its plausibility, its consistency with other testimony, the witness\u2019 manner on the stand, and whether the person has a motive to lie. But, the judge said, \u201cthere is no particular formula for evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of another person\u2019s statement.\u201d The principles he outlined are standard but perhaps all the more relevant after Trump\u2019s defense leaned heavily on questioning the credibility of key prosecution witnesses, including Cohen. Any verdict must be unanimous. During deliberations, six alternate jurors who also sat through every minute of the trial will be kept at the courthouse in a separate room in case they are needed to replace a juror who falls ill or is otherwise unavailable. If that happens, deliberations will start anew once the replacement juror is in place. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of former President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.", "summary": "Jury deliberations have begun in Donald Trump&#8217;s hush money trial, putting the outcome of the historic case in the hands of a dozen New Yorkers who have vowed to be fair and impartial in the face of their unprecedented task.

The payment, allegedly made to help Trump\u2019s election bid, exceeds the amount an individual can contribute to a campaign, prosecutors argued. Over six weeks of testimony the jury heard from 22 witnesses, including Cohen, who testified that he fronted the hush money payment to Daniels and was repaid by the Trump Organization, which logged the checks as legal expenses. Daniels also took the stand, delivering bombshell testimony about how she allegedly had a \u201cbrief\u201d sexual encounter with Trump in the \u201cmissionary position\u201d and how he didn\u2019t wear a condom, unlike the male porn actors she had worked with. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has taken every opportunity in front of media cameras at court and on Truth Social to rip the case as \u201celection interference\u201d and a politically motivated witch hunt. Before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan gave the jury instructions on the law Wednesday morning, Trump \u2014 in a post on Truth Social \u2014 blasted the fact that prosecutors delivered five hours of closing arguments, while his lawyer only gave 3.5 hours of closings. He also attacked the gag order that has been in place throughout trial barring him from speaking out about witnesses, jurors and court staff. \u201cTHE D.A.\u2019s OFFICE WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON WITH 5 HOURS OF BULL\u2026.

It was far from certain how long jurors might take to reach a verdict in the first criminal trial of a U.S. president. Trump, 77, is charged with falsifying business documents to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star shortly before the 2016 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. \u201cMother Teresa could not beat these charges,\u201d he told reporters outside the courtroom, referring to the late Nobel Peace Prize laureate. \u201cThe whole thing is rigged.\u201d Shortly before deliberations began, the judge overseeing the trial told jurors that they cannot rely solely on the testimony of star witness Michael Cohen, who played a central role in the hush money payment at the heart of the case. Justice Juan Merchan told jurors to apply extra scrutiny to Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer, because he testified he was directly involved in Trump\u2019s alleged effort to cover up the payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. \u201cEven if you find the testimony of Michael Cohen to be believable, you may not convict the defendant solely on that testimony unless you find it was corroborated by other evidence,\u201d Merchan said. Merchan\u2019s comments were part of his detailed instructions to the 12 jurors and six alternates who have sat silently in a New York courtroom for weeks while prosecutors laid out their case and Trump\u2019s lawyers tried to knock it down. \u201cYou must set aside any personal opinions or bias you might have in favor of or against the defendant,\u201d Merchan said. A guilty verdict could upend the 2024 presidential race, in which Trump, the Republican candidate, is seeking to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Merchan\u2019s instructions underlined the pivotal role played by Cohen, who was Trump\u2019s lawyer and fixer for roughly a decade before they had a falling out. Cohen testified that he paid $130,000 out of his own pocket to prevent Daniels from telling voters about the alleged sexual encounter with Trump that she says took place 10 years before the 2016 election. Cohen testified that Trump approved the payoff and agreed after the election to a plan to reimburse Cohen through monthly installments disguised as legal fees. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued that jurors cannot rely on Cohen, a convicted felon with a long track record of lying, to tell the truth. \u201cHe is literally the greatest liar of all time,\u201d Trump lawyer Todd Blanche toll jurors on Tuesday. In his closing argument on Tuesday, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass walked jurors through voice messages, emails and other documents that he said backed up Cohen\u2019s testimony. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office say the Daniels payment could have contributed to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton by keeping an unflattering story out of the public eye. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know if this effort to hoodwink the American voter impacted the election,\u201d Steinglass told jurors on Tuesday. Prosecutors face the burden of proving Trump\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the standard under U.S. law. A conviction will not prevent Trump, from trying to take back the White House. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show Trump and Biden locked in a tight race. But Reuters/Ipsos polling has found that a guilty verdict could cost Trump support among independent and some Republican voters. A verdict of not guilty would remove a major legal barrier, freeing Trump from the obligation to juggle court appearances and campaign stops. If convicted, he would be expected to appeal. Trump faces three other criminal prosecutions, but they are not expected to go to trial before the Nov. 5 election. Biden campaign officials say any verdict will not substantially change the dynamics of the election.", "summary": "<p>NEW YORK, >> Jurors in Donald Trump&#8217;s criminal hush money trial began deliberations today, retreating behind closed doors to weigh the evidence and testimony they have heard and seen over the last five weeks.</p>", "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/05/29/breaking-news/jury-begins-deliberations-in-trump-criminal-hush-money-trial/", "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/web1_2024-05-29T163916Z_1095329433_RC2608AW5RUD_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK.JPG", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 16:30:00", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.698}, {"id": 225118244, "title": "What to know as jury in Trump \"hush money\" trial begins deliberations", "text": "What to know as jury in Trump \"hush money\" trial begins deliberations Jurors began deliberating on a verdict in former President Donald Trump's \"hush money\" criminal trial in New York.

The natural question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether he\u2019ll be convicted or acquitted. But while a simple verdict is possible, it\u2019s not guaranteed. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the options, with the caveats that we don\u2019t know what will happen or how long it will take. Straight guilty verdict Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Each count corresponds to a particular record \u2014 invoices, vouchers, checks \u2014 and the jury decides each count separately. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty, will be convicted on all counts if the jury agrees unanimously that the prosecution has proved each instance beyond a reasonable doubt. Mixed verdict Another option is that the jury convicts on some counts but not others. Trump will be acquitted on any individual count of the 34 if all 12 jurors agree that the prosecution failed to prove that count beyond a reasonable doubt. Or, if the jury can\u2019t decide them, it will be a hung jury on those counts. Hung jury The jury could also hang on all counts if it\u2019s unable to decide any of them. A hung jury wouldn\u2019t end the case. Legally, it puts the parties back where they started before trial, meaning that we could hypothetically go through this whole thing again if Manhattan prosecutors want to retry the case. Straight acquittal While seemingly the least likely option, it\u2019s possible that the jury fully acquits Trump on all counts. That would end the case. Though defendants can appeal convictions, prosecutors can\u2019t appeal acquittals. It would not, however, end Trump's legal jeopardy, as he has three other, unrelated state and federal indictments pending, to which he has likewise pleaded not guilty.

Jury deliberations began Wednesday in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. The seven-man, five-woman panel is tasked with deciding whether Trump is guilty of any of 34 felony counts of falsifying his company\u2019s records. Prosecutors say Trump falsified the records to veil reimbursements to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, who had paid porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign not to air her claim that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. The former president and presumptive Republican nominee has pleaded not guilty, denies any sexual interaction with Daniels and argues that the payments to Cohen were correctly designated as legal expenses in company records. Now that the case has gone to the jury, here\u2019s a look at how deliberations will work. WHAT IS THE JURY DECIDING? To convict Trump, the jury must unanimously find he created a fraudulent entry in his company\u2019s records, or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of violating, or concealing a violation of a state law making it illegal for conspirators \u201cto promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\u201d While the jury must agree that something unlawful was done to promote Trump\u2019s election, they don\u2019t have to be unanimous on what that unlawful thing was. In this case, jurors could choose between three possible unlawful acts: -- They could find that one of the conspirators broke the Federal Election Campaign Act, which in 2016 made it illegal for a person to give something worth more than $2,700 to a presidential campaign. It also banned corporations from contributing to a campaign. -- They could find that other business records were falsified, including federal tax forms the Trump Organization issued to Cohen, bank records associated with Cohen\u2019s formation of two limited liability companies, bank records associated with a wire transfer Cohen made to Daniels\u2019 lawyer, or an invoice used when the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company paid Karen McDougal, a former model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. -- They could find that false information was submitted on a tax return. For a conviction, each juror would have to find that at least one of those unlawful things happened. WHERE DO DELIBERATIONS HAPPEN? Behind closed doors in a room reserved for the jury. While the 12 deliberate, the six alternate jurors who have also observed the whole trial will be in a separate space in the courthouse. If a jury member is unable to continue because of illness or other reasons, an alternate juror will then take that person\u2019s place, and deliberations will begin anew. Jurors went into deliberations after getting detailed instructions on the relevant laws in the case, what must be proven in order for them to convict, and their duty to acquit if it\u2019s not proven. They had to hand over their cellphones to court officers to hold. WHAT WILL WE KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS? Very little. The deliberations are secret, though jurors \u2014 whose identities are being kept from the public \u2014 can have a court officer deliver notes from them to the judge. For example, they might ask for legal guidance, inquire about scheduling or ask for some testimony to be read to them from the court transcript. (They don\u2019t have the transcript in the jury room but do have a court laptop loaded with documents and other exhibits that were shown during the trial.) If the jury sends such a note, the judge generally reads it in court and then discusses with prosecutors and defense lawyers how to respond, such as exactly which testimony is relevant to the request. Then jurors are brought into court to hear the answer. Court-watchers sometimes speculate about what the contents of a note might imply about the deliberations, but there\u2019s no way to know for sure. Jurors also send a note to signal when they have reached a verdict \u2014 or, sometimes, to say they\u2019re bogged down. WHERE WILL TRUMP BE IN THE MEANTIME? He doesn\u2019t have to stay in the courtroom itself but must be in the building. During the trial, he and his attorneys and security personnel have had the use of a courtroom across the hall for breaks. HOW LONG WILL JURORS DELIBERATE? As long as they need to. The standard court day runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a break for lunch (jurors\u2019 meals will be delivered). But judges sometimes extend the hours if jurors wish. In this case, Judge Juan M. Merchan already has decided that deliberations will proceed on Wednesday, which is normally a day off from the trial. There\u2019s no limit on how many days deliberations can continue. DO THE JURORS GET TO GO HOME? Yes, at the end of each court day. The jury isn\u2019t sequestered, the legal term for isolating the panel from the outside world. That was once mandatory for many felony cases in New York state, but the requirement was lifted in 2001, and sequestration is now rare. WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE\u2019S A VERDICT? Jurors will send a note, via a court officer, saying there is a verdict, but not what it is. The judge will summon Trump, his defense team and prosecutors back to the courtroom if they\u2019re not there already, and then announce that the jury has reached a verdict. Then the jury will be brought in, and the foreperson \u2014 in New York, that job generally goes to the first juror chosen \u2014 will be asked whether the jury has reached a verdict. If the answer is yes, the foreperson will then be asked what the verdict is for each count and will answer either \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Then the jury likely will be asked collectively, \u201cIs this your verdict?\u201d Prosecutors or defense lawyers also can ask to have each juror asked the same question individually. WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE ISN\u2019T A VERDICT? If jurors send a note saying they can\u2019t agree, the judge, in consultation with both sides, must decide what to do next. Defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial. That could be granted, but often, the response is to call the jury in for some form of instruction to keep trying. Prosecutors and defense lawyers often debate what should be said. Judges may look to the New York court system\u2019s sample language for what\u2019s known as a \u201cmodified Allen charge.\u201d It urges jurors to make every possible effort to reach a verdict, and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If deadlock notes continue, the message may be repeated or tweaked. So, too, arguments for a mistrial.

The panelists \u2014 five women and seven men \u2014 could find the ex-president guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, felonies that carry theoretical prison time of up to four years. Here are the details jurors \u2014 including two lawyers, a retired wealth manager, a speech therapist, an engineer, and some who complimented Trump for \u201cspeaking his mind\u201d or criticized his \u201cselfish\u201d public persona \u2014 are weighing while they work toward making a decision. Were these 34 different business documents \u2018falsified\u2019? In order to convict, the jurors must first unanimously agree that 34 different business records involved with Trump\u2019s alleged reimbursement of the hush money his former \u201cfixer\u201d Michael Cohen paid to Daniels were \u201cfalse.\u201d Evidence presented at the seven-week trial in Manhattan Supreme Court shows that Cohen received $35,000 per month from Trump\u2019s trust account throughout 2017. Jurors also saw the handwriting of Cohen and then-Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg on a document describing a scheme to pay Cohen a \u201cgrossed-up sum\u201d of $420,000 that year, including a bonus and to account for income taxes he\u2019d have to pay. Cohen and Weisselberg wrote these notes on a copy of bank statement that described Cohen\u2019s shell company paying Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer $130,000 in October 2016, days before the election. Yet the Trump company documents, including 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks, all describes the purpose of Cohen\u2019s payments as phony \u201clegal services\u201d \u2014 rather than as payback for silencing a porn star, prosecutors said. Did Trump have \u2018intent\u2019 to cover up a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 to elect him in 2016 by \u2018unlawful means?\u2019 If they choose to unanimously find him guilty of first-degree \u201cfalsifying business records,\u201d the jury needs to then find that Trump fudged the records in order to cover up another crime. That crime, according to prosecutors, is a New York state law that makes it illegal to enter into a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to get someone elected to public office by \u201cunlawful means.\u201d David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer magazine, testified to working with Trump and Cohen to bury womens\u2019 stories about affairs with Trump, and to publish puff pieces extolling his virtues. Jurors need to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump had the \u201cintent\u201d \u2014 defined as \u201cconscious objective or purpose\u201d \u2014 to cover up this alleged conspiracy. Follow The Post\u2019s live blog for the latest updates on Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chush money\u201d trial But prosecutors \u201cneed not prove that the other crime was in fact committed,\u201d Justice Juan Merchan explained Wednesday morning. In other words, to convict, jurors need to believe that the conspiracy existed and that Trump tried to conceal it, but don\u2019t need to believe that the conspiracy happened beyond a reasonable doubt. What were those \u2018unlawful means\u2019? Jurors have three choices: If jurors make it this far, they\u2019ll then have to decide whether they believe that the alleged 2016 election conspiracy \u2014 which involves hush money payouts to both Daniels and the Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 was done using what are called \u201cunlawful means.\u201d But panelists can take a choose-your-own-adventure path to deciding what those \u201cunlawful means\u201d are. They have three choices, Judge Merchan explained. They could find that the hush money payouts breached federal campaign finance laws by exceeding the $2,700 cap on individual donations to campaigns, but only if the payouts wouldn\u2019t have happened anyway even if Trump wasn\u2019t running, the judge said. Jurors could also find that the hush money payouts violated tax law, or that more business records were \u201cfalsified\u201d during the alleged conspiracy. For example, jurors could find that the \u201cunlawful means\u201d are that Cohen fudged records by not being honest with banks when he created his shell companies that he used for the payoffs, Merchan said Wednesday morning. Jurors, if they choose to convict, have to agree unanimously that the \u201cunlawful means\u201d happened. But they could individually believe that Trump, Cohen and Pecker used different underlying \u201cunlawful means\u201d and still convict, the judge said. The jury could also choose to acquit Trump on all of the counts \u2014 for which he would not be allowed to be re-tried \u2014 or to convict him on some of the counts, like for example the checks that he signed himself. They could also fail to come to an unanimous verdict and deadlock, in which case the judge could order a mistrial. Any new trial would almost certainly not happen until after November\u2019s presidential election, if at all.", "summary": "A jury of 12 Manhattanites is now weighing whether to convict Donald Trump of illegally concealing a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/us-news/heres-what-jurors-at-trumps-hush-money-trial-are-considering-as-they-deliberate-whether-to-convict-ex-prez/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-rkfiga7fx-1717005936211.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716991893&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/S2dgvjYy-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 18:11:40", "author": "Ben Kochman", "authors": ["Ben Kochman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.412}, {"id": 225162304, "title": "Jury Deliberating Trump Verdict in New York", "text": "Jurors began deliberating in former President Donald Trump\u2019s criminal case in New York on May 29, after New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan spent more than one hour instructing the jury on the law. President Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, meaning the 34 records were allegedly falsified with the intent to conceal another crime. \u201cIntent means conscious objective or purpose,\u201d the judge defined for jurors. \u201cIntent does not require premeditation. In other words, intent does not require advance planning, nor is it necessary that the intent exist in the person\u2019s mind for a given period of time.\u201d The judge set out three possibilities for that other crime: conspiracy to promote or prevent the election of a person to office by unlawful means, they may consider violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), falsification of business records, or violation of tax laws. FECA makes it unlawful to make contributions to presidential candidates over a certain limit. An expenditure made in cooperation, consultant, or concert with a candidate can be considered a \u201ccontribution.\u201d The contribution limit in 2015 and 2016 was $2,700.

They will decide if Trump will be convicted or acquitted of 34 felony counts of falsified business records. This is the first criminal trial against a former or sitting U.S. president. All 12 jurors \u2014 plus six alternates who were asked to stay in case they are needed \u2014 have listened to just over four weeks of testimony as the prosecution argued that Trump was involved in a scheme meant to conceal a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to further another crime. The fact of the payments isn't in dispute. What prosecutors needed to prove is that Trump made them in order to cover up other crimes, such as violating campaign finance law and mischaracterizing the payments for tax purposes. The jury heard from 22 witnesses with often-dramatic testimony. Jurors will weigh evidence, including documents like phone records, invoices and checks, as they try to reach a verdict. Trump has pleaded not guilty. The verdict must be unanimous. If all 12 jurors can\u2019t agree, the jury is considered \u201chung,\u201d and the judge will declare a mistrial. The district attorney prosecuting the case will have to decide whether to try the case again. On Wednesday, New York Judge Juan Merchan reminded the jury of their promise to be impartial and leave their biases at the door. For an hour, he delivered the jury instructions, reminding jurors that some evidence \u2014 such as former Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea to violating federal campaign finance laws, or certain headlines that ran in newspapers \u2014 is used only to establish the credibility of other witnesses, and give context to the timing of events, and not to determine Trump\u2019s guilt. Merchan also explained how the jury should define the law at hand, which includes the intent to defraud and falsify business records. In this case, he said prosecutors argued Trump aimed to conceal breaking New York election law by falsifying business records. In order to determine this, the jury may look at three of the prosecution's theories: Federal Election Campaign Act violation, falsification of other business records or violation of tax laws. The jurors will head into a room, give up their cellphones, and begin deliberation. They have one laptop with all the evidence. They will deliberate until at least 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. The legal teams and Trump have been instructed not to leave the building in case there is a jury note that could indicate a question or a possible verdict. In closing arguments that lasted a day, the defense and the prosecution laid out their final arguments. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche focused intently on the credibility of former Trump lawyer Cohen and argued that influencing an election is not illegal. Prosecutors sought to build up Cohen's testimony by reminding jurors of all the other witnesses they heard from, and walking them through the checks, invoices and ledgers that constitute the 34 counts of falsified business records. Throughout the trial, Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has lamented his inability to campaign as much as he would like, since, per New York criminal law, he has to attend the trial every day that court is in session. He has also accused the judge of being biased. He reiterated those comments \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Wednesday in the hallways as the jurors began their deliberations. \u201cMother Theresa could not beat these charges. The charges are rigged,\" he said. \"The whole thing is rigged.\" What the jury heard In August 2015, two months after Trump announced his 2016 presidential bid, David Pecker, then the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower, according to Pecker\u2019s testimony. At that meeting, Pecker testified, it was agreed that he would be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the Trump campaign. His job was to look out for negative stories from women he could \u201ctake off the marketplace,\u201d by buying up the rights but never publishing them. The plan, as Pecker outlined it, was that he would suppress these stories, and at the same time publish negative stories about Trump\u2019s opponents. Some of these stories, Pecker said, were sent to Trump and Cohen for approval prior to publication. Over the next year, Pecker said he carried out this role. His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented both Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. In about June 2016, McDougal considered going public with her story of a year-long affair with Trump. But Pecker bought the rights to that story, with the expectation that he would be reimbursed by Trump. That never happened. In early October 2016, according to the testimony of former Trump communications aide Hope Hicks, the campaign was rocked by the release of the Access Hollywood tape, where Trump could be heard boasting \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the p****.\u201d The next day, according to Pecker, Cohen and Davidson, Daniels threatened to go public with accusations she'd had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite during a celebrity golf tournament. In her testimony, Daniels testified that there was a \u201cpower imbalance\u201d that made her feel she had to have sex with Trump, when, after leaving the suite\u2019s restroom, she found Trump on the hotel bed in his underwear. She testified that Trump had dangled a possible role on his TV show Celebrity Apprentice. This detail \u2014 that the sex wasn\u2019t entirely wanted \u2014 caused the defense to request a mistrial, which was denied. It also provided a motive for Trump to suppress the story. Prosecutors said, \u201cTrump knew what happened in that hotel room\u201d and didn\u2019t want it to come out. The adult film actor\u2019s testimony also included intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter, some of which Judge Merchan agreed with the defense were not necessary. As October drew to a close, Cohen testified, he frantically opened bank accounts and tried to come up with a way to pay the $130,000 to keep Daniels quiet. But Trump, Cohen said, wanted to delay the payment until after the election, with the idea that after that it wouldn\u2019t matter if Daniels was paid. This point, that Trump was making the payment to influence the election by keeping women voters on board, was corroborated by a number of other witnesses. Hicks, who said Trump, by then in the White House, told her that it was better the story came out in 2018, rather than 2016. Cohen ultimately wired the money himself to Daniels, with the understanding, he said, that he would be repaid. Cohen testified to a number of conversations with Trump, backed up by phone records, including on the day he wired the payments. But the defense rattled Cohen on cross-examination when it presented evidence that one of the calls which Cohen had said was made through Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, was instead with Schiller about threats from a 14-year-old prankster. Still, the heart of the case rests on the testimony of what happened after the election, when the records were allegedly falsified, in particular the handwritten notes and documents from the Trump Organization\u2019s former comptroller, Jeff McConney. McConney authenticated a key record: the bank statement showing Cohen\u2019s wire transfer. That record included handwritten notes from Cohen and Trump\u2019s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, describing the $130,000 payment that would be \u201cgrossed up\u201d to cover Cohen\u2019s taxes. That sum, combined with another reimbursement and a bonus, for a total of $420,000, was paid out over 12 months at a rate of $35,000 per month. The payments would be described as pursuant to a \u201clegal retainer.\u201d (Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial, did not testify.) On the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal \u201cretainers.\u201d Nine of the checks were signed by Trump, himself. Cohen said he and Weisselberg met and discussed the agreement with Trump shortly before he left for Washington, on or about Jan. 17, 2020. Cohen said Trump approved the deal, saying at the end of the meeting that \u201cit was going to be one heck of a ride,\u201d in Washington. Cohen said he and Trump discussed the arrangement again, in early February, in the Oval Office. Photos and White House records corroborate that the two met in the Oval Office at the time. The defense presented just two witnesses, including Robert Costello, an attorney who wanted to represent Cohen after Cohen\u2019s home and office were searched by the FBI in 2018. Costello had been put on the stand to refute Cohen\u2019s claim that Costello was pressuring Cohen to stay on Trump\u2019s \u201cteam.\u201d But Costello\u2019s emails showed that Trump was deciding which of Cohen\u2019s lawyers he wanted to pay, and that Costello was concerned about not giving \u201cthe appearance that we are following instructions from [Rudy] Giuliani or the president,\u201d referring to the former New York City mayor who was Trump\u2019s lawyer at the time. What comes next Jurors could deliberate for hours, days or weeks as they try to reach a unanimous decision. If Trump is convicted, Merchan would later issue the sentence, which may or may not include prison time; some legal experts believe imprisonment for a former president is unlikely. A conviction does not prevent Trump from being the GOP nominee, nor continuing his bid for president. It is likely his legal team would appeal the decision, as they have in past civil trials in New York. If he is acquitted of the charges, Trump cannot be retried for the same charges. The jurors range from all over Manhattan, including Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, Murray Hill and the Upper West Side. They are litigators, teachers, physical therapists and investment bankers. Their hobbies range from wood and metal working, hiking, fly fishing and exploring New York City. There are seven men and five women. Merchan has tried to ensure that the jury remains anonymous, citing safety concerns.

That phone call was only, I believe was a minute and thirty-six seconds long.\u201d She then continued, breaking down the situation: \u201cCohen also in that time said he also spoke to Trump\u2019s body guard, he had to speak to Trump\u2019s bodyguard Keith Schiller and say, \u2018Hey, will you put Trump on,\u2019 and then he spoke with Trump about Stormy Daniels. The defense claim that if it was only a minute and thirty-six seconds that wasn\u2019t enough time for Cohen to have had any substantive discussion with Trump about Stormy Daniels and about this alleged hush money plot.\u201d On Tuesday, closing arguments were given in Trump\u2019s New York hush money case. Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche spoke first and took the opportunity to go after the validity of that phone call Cohen said he had with Trump on Oct. 24, 2016. In his testimony, Cohen said Trump\u2019s bodyguard Schiller put the former president on the phone so they could discuss Cohen paying Daniels. Afterward, Blanche presented Cohen with a text conversation that happened around the same time as Cohen\u2019s phone call claims, and Blanche stated the text chat was merely regarding Trump needing help with a teenage prankster. \u201cWe all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days and forgot to block his number, and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that,\u201d Blanche said. Maddow said the event was one of the most telling moments from the case, specifically as it relates to how it will impact the jurors\u2019 decisions. \u201cFor me, if you\u2019re the jury, the defense has offered \u2026 a few alternate explanations for the fact pattern that\u2019s been presented,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cOne of the most compelling, surprising, memorable moments was when the defense said, \u2018Hey, that call that Cohen described where he had to get Keith Schiller to get Trump on the phone, let me tell you what else is in Michael Cohen\u2019s phone records around there. Let me tell you about this 14-year-old child that was harassing Michael Cohen. You didn\u2019t know about that. This is a rabbit out of a hat.\u201d She went on: \u201cThis is a whole new interpretation of this fact pattern.

Merchan told the jury in former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial that they don\u2019t need a unanimous verdict to convict Trump. AP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. Merchan said that to convict Trump the jury will have to find unanimously, on each of 34 felony counts, that he falsified business records and that he did so with the intent of concealing another crime \u2014 in this case, violating a state election law during his 2016 campaign. The judge said jurors could consider three different ways the law may have been broken and that they don\u2019t have to be unanimous on this decision. THE FACTS: As jury deliberations began Wednesday in Trump\u2019s trial, social media users spread false information about Merchan\u2019s instructions to the seven men and five women who will determine the outcome in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. \u201cHow is this even a fair trial?\u201d reads one Instagram post that had received more than 8,000 likes as of Wednesday. \u201cThe judge just announced that the jury does not even have to be unanimous in their judgment to convict President Trump! This entire process was rigged from the start.\u201d An X post reads: \u201cJudge Merchan has told the jury that they do NOT NEED unanimity to convict. They do not have to all agree on what occurred. 4 can agree on one crime, 4 on a different one, and the other 4 on another. He will treat 4-4-4 as a UNANIMOUS verdict.\u201d But these claims distort Merchan\u2019s instructions. The judge told the jury that to convict Trump on any given charge, they will have to find unanimously \u2014 that is, all 12 jurors must agree \u2014 that the former president created a fraudulent entry in his company\u2019s records or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of committing or concealing a crime. Prosecutors say the crime Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators \u201cto promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\u201d Merchan gave the jurors three possible \u201cunlawful means\u201d they can apply to Trump\u2019s charges: falsifying other business records, breaking the Federal Election Campaign Act or submitting false information on a tax return. For a conviction, each juror would have to find that at least one of those three things happened, but they don\u2019t have to agree unanimously on which it was. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a scheme to bury damaging stories that he feared could hurt his 2016 campaign, particularly as his reputation was suffering at the time from comments he had made about women.___This is part of the AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

They requested to rehear jury instructions, as well as rehear testimony from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where he agreed to identify negative stories for Trump, a phone call he says he had with Trump about the Karen McDougal deal, and his decision not to sell the rights to McDougal\u2019s story to Trump. The jury also asked to hear Michael Cohen's testimony about the same Trump Tower meeting. Judge Juan M. Merchan said it would take some time to gather the requested testimony and about a half hour to re-read it to the jury. Deliberations will resume Thursday morning. The historic deliberations followed Tuesday's whirlwind of closing arguments, which stretched into the evening as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass accused Trump of intentionally deceiving voters by allegedly participating in a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d scheme to bury stories that might obliterate his 2016 presidential bid. The defense approached its summation much in the same way it approached cross-examination: by targeting the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. He has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were falsely logged as \u201clegal expenses\u201d to hide the true nature of the transactions. The case is the first of Trump's four indictments to reach trial and is the first-ever criminal case against a former U.S. president. Currently: \u2014 Cohen\u2019s credibility, campaigning at court and other highlights from closing arguments \u2014 Rallies and debates used to define campaigns. Now they\u2019re about juries and trials \u2014 Biden's campaign shows up outside Trump's trial with Robert De Niro and others \u2014 Another big name will be at the courthouse in Manhattan on Wednesday: Harvey Weinstein \u2014 Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events Here's the latest: WHY DOES GATHERING REQUESTED TESTIMONY TAKE SO LONG? One reason why the process of gathering requested testimony for the jury is somewhat painstaking is that witnesses aren\u2019t always asked about events in one fell swoop. Sometimes lawyers will return to a topic at different points in their questioning, and the same events can be covered again and again on direct examination and cross-examination. One of the goals of sifting through the transcripts is to ensure that no relevant testimony is left out. The lawyers also want to make sure that testimony they feel isn\u2019t relevant to the jury\u2019s request is left out of whatever is read back to the panel. Opposing sides often debate what is and isn\u2019t pertinent. LAWYERS WORK TO ISOLATE PORTIONS OF TRIAL TRANSCRIPTS With Donald Trump gone from the courtroom, a pair of prosecutors and a pair of defense lawyers in his hush money case huddled Wednesday afternoon around the defense table poring over hard copies of the transcripts. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass leaned over a thick, bound transcript, reading through lines as his colleague Susan Hoffinger jotted notes on a notepad. Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove stood at their spots at the defense table, reading through yet more transcripts and conferring with their opposite numbers. At one point, Steinglass looked up from his volume and flashed a broad smile at Blanche, who reacted in kind \u2014 a moment of collegiality among courtroom rivals. JUDGE GRANTS DEFENSE REQUEST Judge Juan M. Merchan granted a defense request Wednesday afternoon to allow Donald Trump to return to his waiting area in the courtroom across the hall while the lawyers continue to work on the transcript issue. However, Trump can\u2019t leave yet \u2014 Merchan said he wants him close by in case any issues arise that require his presence. JURY EXCUSED FOR THE DAY Judge Juan M. Merchan has excused jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial, ending the first day of deliberations. Merchan said the jury can decide on its own if it wants to hear all of the instructions again, or just some, and then send him another note reflecting that decision. He estimated that the rereading aloud of the requested testimony from former National Enquirer Publisher and Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen would take about a half hour, but he added that the relevant transcript pages were still being gathered. Prosecutors estimated to Merchan that the sections of testimony that jurors have asked to rehear are about 30 pages and will take about 30 minutes to be reread. The jurors deliberated for 4\u00bd hours Wednesday. Before excusing jurors for the day, Merchan told them that going forward they can work until 6 p.m. each day \u2014 but the decision is up to them on how long they want to go after the normal end of the court day at 4:30 p.m. Jurors will resume deliberating on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. He said they will be summoned to the courtroom once the transcript pages are ready to be reread aloud for them. JURY SENDS ANOTHER NOTE Jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial have sent another note to Judge Juan M. Merchan \u2014 this time requesting to rehear jury instructions. Merchan said he will bring the jury back into the courtroom to see if it wants to hear a portion or all of the instructions. WHY IS THE JURY SENDING A NOTE WITH REQUESTS? The jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial does not have a transcript of witness testimony from the case. All they have with them is a verdict sheet and a laptop loaded with documents and other exhibits presented in the case. The panel can\u2019t have any of the transcripts of testimony in the case while deliberating, nor can they be given a written copy of the instructions that were read to them Wednesday morning. Instead, the panel must send a note to the judge each time it wants to have a snippet of testimony read out or get a refresher on the instructions it must follow. JURY REQUESTS PECKER'S TESTIMONY AND MORE The jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial has made four requests in a note to the judge. It wants to hear former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker\u2019s testimony regarding the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where he agreed to identify negative stories for Trump, a phone call he says he had with Trump about the Karen McDougal deal, and his decision not to sell the rights to McDougal\u2019s story to Trump. The jury also wants to hear Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony about the same Trump Tower meeting. Judge Juan M. Merchan said it would take some time to gather the requested testimony. Then he\u2019ll bring jurors into the courtroom and have it read to them. JURY SENDS FIRST NOTE TO JUDGE The jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial has sent its first note to the judge. The note\u2019s contents have not yet been made public but will be read in court soon. The jury, which is deliberating in secret in a side room, indicated it had a note by ringing a courtroom bell at 2:56 p.m., about 3\u00bd hours into deliberations. While deliberating, juries can only communicate with the judge by note. They may involve questions such as requests to hear portions of testimony or rehear certain instructions. STUCK WAITING AT THE COURTHOUSE, TRUMP RANTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA Donald Trump's complaints on social media about the hush money case persisted Wednesday as the jury deliberated. \u201cIT IS RIDICULOUS, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND UNAMERICAN that the highly Conflicted, Radical Left Judge is not requiring a unanimous decision on the fake charges against me brought by Soros backed D.A. Alvin Bragg,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA THIRD WORLD ELECTION INTERFERENCE HOAX!\u201d Despite his declaration, any verdict in the case has to be unanimous: guilty or not guilty. If the jurors disagree, they keep deliberating. If they get to a point where they are hopelessly deadlocked, then the judge can declare a mistrial. If they convict, they must agree that Trump created a false entry in his company\u2019s records or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of committing or concealing another crime \u2014 in this case, violating a state election law. What the jurors do not have to agree on, however, is which way that election law was violated. HOW LONG WILL THE JURY DELIBERATE? Jurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial will deliberate as long as they need to. The standard court day runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a break for lunch. But judges sometimes extend the hours if jurors wish. In this case, Judge Juan M. Merchan already has decided that deliberations will proceed on Wednesday, which is normally a day off from the trial. There\u2019s no limit on how many days deliberations can continue. WHITE HOUSE: BIDEN'S ATTENTION ISN'T FOCUSED ON TRUMP'S TRIAL As jury deliberations get underway in Donald Trump's hush money trial, the White House says President Joe Biden's attention is focused elsewhere. \u201cThe president\u2019s focused on the American people, delivering for the American people,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden to Philadelphia, where he has campaign events scheduled Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s his focus.\u201d FACT CHECK: YES, THE JURY MUST COME TO A UNANIMOUS VERDICT As the jury begins its deliberations in Donald Trump's hush money case, claims are spreading across social media that Judge Juan M. Merchan told the panel they don\u2019t need a unanimous verdict to convict Trump. That\u2019s false. To convict Trump, Merchan told the jury they will have to find unanimously \u2014 that is, all 12 jurors must agree \u2014 that the former president created a fraudulent entry in his company\u2019s records or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the intent of committing or concealing another crime. What\u2019s being distorted by some online is the judge\u2019s instruction about how to reach a verdict about that second element. Prosecutors say the crime Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators \u201cto promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\u201d Merchan gave the jurors three possible \u201cunlawful means\u201d: falsifying other business records, breaking the Federal Election Campaign Act or submitting false information on a tax return. For a conviction, each juror would have to find that at least one of those three things happened, but they don\u2019t have to agree unanimously which it was. COURTROOM SHUTTING DOWN FOR LUNCH The jury in Donald Trump's hush money case will deliberate through the lunch hour, but no action will occur and no notes will be passed during the break. Court will resume at 2:15 p.m. THE JURY HAS BEEN SENT TO DELIBERATE. WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN? Jury deliberations proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and through an intentionally opaque process. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it\u2019s hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how long the jury in Donald Trump's hush money case will deliberate for and there\u2019s no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records and that could take some time. A verdict might not come by the end of the week. To reach a verdict on any given count, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. Things will get trickier if the jury can\u2019t reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Judge Juan M. Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If, after that instruction, the jury still can\u2019t reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial. TRUMP: \u2018MOTHER TERESA COULD NOT BEAT THESE CHARGES\u2019 Former President Donald Trump told reporters after jurors began deliberating in his criminal hush money trial that the charges were rigged and again accused the judge of being conflicted. He further said that \u201cMother Teresa could not beat these charges.\u201d \u201cWhat is happening here is weaponization at a level that nobody\u2019s seen before ever and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen,\u201d Trump said. Trump repeated accusations that the criminal charges were brought by President Joe Biden's administration to hit him, as the president's main election opponent. TRUMP MUST STAY IN THE COURTHOUSE After jurors left the courtroom to begin deliberations, Judge Juan M. Merchan told Donald Trump and his lawyers that they were required to remain in the courthouse. \u201cYou cannot leave the building. We need you to be able to get here quickly if we do receive a note,\u201d Merchan said. After Merchan left the bench, Trump turned and walked to chat with his son, Donald Trump Jr. and lawyer Alina Habba. MERCHAN ADDRESSES ALTERNATE JURORS After the main jury in Donald Trump's hush money case left the courtroom Wednesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan told the six alternates who remain in the courtroom that they will remain on standby in the courthouse as deliberations get underway. He thanked them for their service and diligence, noting he saw one of the alternates go through three notebooks. He said, \u201cThere might be a need for you at some point in deliberations.\u201d The alternates will be kept separate from the main jury and must also surrender their phones to court officers while deliberations are in progress. If a member of the main panel is unable to continue, an alternate can take that person\u2019s place and deliberations will begin anew. JURY DELIBER ATIONS UNDERWAY Jurors in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial have begun deliberating after Judge Juan M. Merchan finished instructing them Wednesday morning on the law governing the case and what they can consider as they work toward a verdict. The trial is the first-ever criminal case against a former U.S. president. TWO ELEMENTS PROSECUTORS MUST PROVE FOR A GUILTY VERDICT Prosecutors are required to prove two elements for each of the counts in order to find Donald Trump guilty, Judge Juan M. Merchan told the jurors. They must find that he \u201cpersonally or by acting in concert with another person or persons made or caused a false entry in the records\u201d or a business. Prosecutors must also prove that Trump did so with the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Prosecutors allege the other crime that Trump intended to commit or conceal was a violation of a state election law regarding a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election by unlawful means. The alleged unlawful means that jurors must consider are: EXPLAINING \u2018CONSPIRACY TO PROMOTE OR PREVENT ELECTION\u2019 In reading instructions to the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial, Judge Juan M. Merchan also went over New York's law against \u201cconspiracy to promote or prevent election,\u201d a statute that\u2019s important to the case. Prosecutors claim that Trump falsified business records to cover up alleged violations of the election conspiracy law. The alleged violations, prosecutors say, were hush money payments that really amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Under New York law, it\u2019s a misdemeanor for two or more people to conspire to promote or prevent a candidate\u2019s election \u201cby unlawful means\u201d if at least one of the conspirators takes action to carry out the plot. The judge noted that the law also requires that a defendant have the intent unlawfully to prevent or promote the candidate\u2019s election \u2014 not just that a defendant knows about the conspiracy or be present when it\u2019s discussed. In the defense\u2019s closing argument Tuesday, Trump attorney Todd Blanche urged jurors to reject prosecutors\u2019 election conspiracy assertions, insisting that \u201cevery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate.\u201d EXPLAINING ACC ESSORIAL LIABILITY Judge Juan M. Merchan instructed jurors on the concept of accessorial liability, under which a defendant can be held criminally responsible for someone else\u2019s actions. That\u2019s a key component of the prosecution\u2019s theory of Donald Trump's hush money case because while Trump signed some of the checks at issue, people working for his company processed Michael Cohen\u2019s invoices and entered the transactions into its accounting system. To hold Trump liable for those actions, Merchan said jurors must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he solicited, requested or commanded those people to engage in that conduct and that he acted intentionally. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass touched on accessorial liability in his closing argument Tuesday, telling jurors: \u201cNo one is saying the defendant actually got behind a computer and typed in the false vouchers or stamped the false invoices or printed the false checks.\u201d \u201cBut he set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of the false business records,\u201d Steinglass said. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. HOW TO JUDGE THE TRUTH The judge in Donald Trump's criminal trial gave the jury some guidance on factors it can use to assess witness testimony, including its plausibility, its consistency with other testimony, the witness\u2019s manner on the stand and whether the person has a motive to lie. But, the judge said, \u201cThere is no particular formula for evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of another person\u2019s statement.\u201d The principles he outlined are standard but perhaps all the more relevant after Trump\u2019s defense team leaned heavily on questioning the credibility of key prosecution witnesses, including the ex-president\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Jurors appeared alert and engaged as Judge Juan M. Merchan instructed them Wednesday morning. Several took notes as he recited instructions. JUDGE TO JURORS: PERSONAL BIAS MUST BE PUT ASIDE The judge in Donald Trump's criminal trial reminded jurors Wednesday morning of their solemn responsibility to decide Trump\u2019s guilt or innocence, gently and methodically reading through standard jury instructions that have a special resonance in the former president\u2019s high-profile case. \u201cAs a juror, you are asked to make a very important decision about another member of the community,\u201d Judge Juan M. Merchan said, underscoring that \u2014 in the eyes of the law \u2014 the jurors and Trump are peers. Merchan also reminded jurors of their vow, during jury selection, \u201cto set aside any personal bias you may have in favor of or against\u201d Trump and decide the case \u201cfairly based on the evidence of the law.\u201d Echoing standard jury instructions, Merchan noted that even though the defense presented evidence, the burden of proof remains on the prosecutor and that Trump is \u201cnot required to prove that he is not guilty.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d noted Merchan, \u201cthe defendant is not required to prove or disprove anything.\u201d READING OF JURY INSTRUCTIONS UNDERWAY The jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial has entered the courtroom and taken their seats. Ahead of deliberations, Judge Juan M. Merchan has begun instructing the panel on the law that governs the case and what they can consider as they work toward a verdict. Jurors will not receive copies of the instructions, but they can request to hear them again as many times as they wish, Merchan said. \u201cIt is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours,\u201d he told them. Trump leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes as Merchan told jurors that reading the instructions would take about an hour. TRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT Donald Trump's motorcade has arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan as proceedings in his hush money trial are set to resume. He did not stop to speak to reporters as he typically does before entering court each day. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., joined him in the courtroom Wednesday morning and was in the first row of the gallery behind the defense table, sitting alongside Trump lawyer and spokesperson Alina Habba. TRUMP POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BEFORE HEADING TO COURT Donald Trump posted again on his social media network before he left Trump Tower to head to the courthouse Wednesday morning, making another all-caps rant about the hush money trial, the judge and Michael Cohen. He called it a \u201cKANGAROO COURT!\u201d and falsely claimed that Judge Juan M. Merchan barred him from defending himself by claiming that his alleged actions were taken on the advice of his then-lawyer, Cohen. Trump\u2019s lawyers in March notified the court that they would not rely on that defense. \u201cTHERE WAS NO CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THE BUM THAT GOT CAUGHT STEALING FROM ME!\u201d Trump said, apparently referring to Cohen. He added: \u201cIN GOD WE TRUST!\u201d Trump is prohibited under a gag order from making out-of-court statements about witnesses in the case, and he was previously penalized for comments about Cohen. It\u2019s unclear if Trump\u2019s latest rant would rise to the level of a violation \u2014 or if prosecutors would seek to have the former president sanctioned for it. The judge has also indicated that he\u2019d give Trump leeway in certain instances to respond to attacks from Cohen. TRUMP'S MOTORCADE HEADS TO COURT Donald Trump's motorcade has left Trump Tower and is on its way to the courthouse in lower Manhattan where his hush money trial will resume. The jury in the case is expected to begin deliberations after receiving instructions from the judge later in the day. WHO IS ON THE JURY? The jury in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial is comprised of 18 Manhattan residents. The main jury includes seven men and five women. There are also six alternate jurors who\u2019ve listened to the testimony but won\u2019t join in the deliberations unless one of the main jurors needs to drop out or is removed. The jury members represents a diverse cross-section of the borough and come from various professional backgrounds, including a sales professional, a software engineer, a security engineer, a teacher, a speech therapist, multiple lawyers, an investment banker and a retired wealth manager. Jurors\u2019 names are being kept from the public. A RECAP OF TESTIMONY JURORS HEARD IN THE CASE Across more than four weeks of testimony, prosecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Among the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses: Trump\u2019s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, porn actor Stormy Daniels, tabloid publisher David Pecker and lawyer Keith Davidson, who negotiated hush money deals for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen testified that he paid $130,000 in hush money to Daniels at Trump\u2019s behest weeks before the 2016 election to keep her quiet about her claims of a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. Trump denies the encounter took place. Cohen also said Trump was involved in an arrangement to repay him and log the payments as legal expenses. Daniels gave an at-times graphic account of the alleged encounter. Pecker testified about agreeing to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign by tipping Cohen off to negative stories, including Daniels\u2019 claim. Davidson talked about negotiating the deals and what he said was Cohen\u2019s frustration after the Daniels deal that Trump still hadn\u2019t repaid him. The defense\u2019s big witness was attorney Robert Costello, who testified last Monday and Tuesday about negotiating to represent Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s properties in 2018. HOW WILL THE JURY DELIBERATIONS WORK? Jury deliberations in Donald Trump's hush money trial will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that\u2019s intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it\u2019s hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. ANOTHER FAMOUS FACE AT THE COURTHOUSE Donald Trump will not be the only big name appearing before a judge in lower Manhattan on Wednesday \u2014 fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected to appear for a hearing related to the retrial of his landmark #MeToo-era rape case. The hearing will take place in the same courthouse where Trump is currently on trial and where Weinstein was originally convicted in 2020. Weinstein's conviction was overturned in April after the court found that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case. His retrial is slated for sometime after Labor Day. A MOTION THAT STILL HASN'T BEEN DECIDED The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial might have one last piece of business to address on Wednesday before jurors receive instructions and can begin deliberations. Last Monday, defense lawyers filed a motion asking the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that prosecutors had failed to prove their case and there was no evidence of falsified business records or an intent to defraud. Prosecutors rebutted that assertion, saying \u201cthe trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each element\u201d of the alleged offenses, and the case should proceed to the jury. Judge Juan M. Merchan did not indicate at the time when he would issue a decision on the request. More than a week later, it remains unclear whether he will address it before the case goes to the jury. WHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION? Jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin deliberations on Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge on the law that governs the case and what they can consider as they strive toward a verdict in the first criminal case against a former U.S. president. The panel has a weighty task ahead of them \u2014 deciding whether to convict or acquit Trump of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with. But what had to be proved for a conviction? To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors had to convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense needed to convince at least one juror that prosecutors didn't prove Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. If the jury deadlocks after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/latest-trumps-criminal-trial-enter-100503002.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/q.e8AtoKg2oP9Y7KfcS.0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/903d5cb5e5c0943f6bb536158e4f3f0f", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 21:11:01", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.336}, {"id": 225220284, "title": "Jury in Trump Trial Dismissed for the Day After Deliberating for Hours, Requesting Pecker, Cohen Testimony", "text": "The jury in former President Donald Trump\u2019s business records trial was dismissed for the day on Wednesday after deliberating for hours and requesting to be given testimony from David Pecker \u2014 the former publisher of the National Enquirer \u2014 and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Before being dismissed, the jury signaled that it had a note for Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing Trump\u2019s business records trial. Trump is currently facing 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree regarding payments made to adult entertainment star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty. Jurors requested to have testimony from Pecker\u2019s phone call with Trump. Pecker was the first person to testify in the trial. His tabloid reportedly engaged in \u201ccatch and kill\u201d practices to bury damaging stories about Trump. The jury also requested to have Pecker\u2019s testimony regarding a decision not to finalize and fund former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2019s life rights, Pecker\u2019s testimony regarding a Trump Tower meeting, and Cohen\u2019s testimony on a meeting at Trump Tower.

Various reports came in on what exactly Merchan reportedly told the jurors. Post-summation instructions inform the jurors that whatever verdict on each of the 34 counts they consider, it \u201cmust be unanimous.\u201d \u201cYour verdict, on each count you consider, whether guilty or not guilty, must be unanimous; that is, each and every juror must agree to it.\u201d CNN reported that the jury needed to be \u201cunanimous if they find Trump guilty on each count \u2013 on whether he committed the crime personally, acted in concert with others or both.\u201d John Roberts, the co-anchor of America Reports on Fox News, reported that Merchan informed the jurors that they did not need unanimity in order to convict Trump. Judge Merchan just told the jury that they do not need unanimity to convict. 4 could agree on one crime, 4 on a different one, and the other 4 on another. He said he would treat 4-4-4 as a unanimous verdict. \u2014 John Roberts (@johnrobertsFox) May 29, 2024 George Washington University law school professor Jonathan Turley reported from the courtroom that Merchan had told the jurors that \u201cthere is no need to agree on what occurred. They can disagree on what the crime was among the three choices. Thus, this means that they could split 4-4-4 and he will still treat them as unanimous.\u201d The court is expected to resume on Thursday at 9:30 a.m.", "summary": "<p>The jury in former President Donald Trump's business records trial was dismissed for the day on Wednesday after deliberating for hours.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/05/29/jury-in-trump-trial-dismissed-for-the-day-after-deliberating-for-hours-requesting-pecker-cohen-testimony/\">Jury in Trump Trial Dismissed for the Day After Deliberating for Hours, Requesting Pecker, Cohen Testimony</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/05/29/jury-in-trump-trial-dismissed-for-the-day-after-deliberating-for-hours-requesting-pecker-cohen-testimony/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/trump-trial-640x335.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 22:01:01", "author": "Elizabeth Weibel", "authors": ["Elizabeth Weibel"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.449}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225109966, "title": "Scottie Scheffler PGA Championship charges set to get dropped", "text": "Scottie Scheffler is a free man. Early on Friday, May 17, the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) placed Scheffler under arrest and charged him with four crimes, which included assaulting a police officer to the second degree\u2014a felony. However, a report from Terry Meiners, a radio personality from Louisville, Kentucky, indicates that police will drop these charges. This announcement comes six days after Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel addressed the media and released two videos that detailed the incident. Another press conference featuring Jefferson County Attorney Mike O\u2019Connell and Scheffler\u2019s defense attorney, Steve Romines, is set for Wednesday. Since this session with media is scheduled five days before Scheffler\u2019s arraignment, early indications pointed to prosecutors dropping this case altogether. It makes sense for them to do so, considering the videos released made things look as if Scheffler did nothing wrong. Scheffler tried maneuvering around traffic and entering Valhalla\u2019s front gates before his second-round tee time that morning. A tragic fatal accident had occurred earlier, thus leading to the logjam and an increased police presence. But the two-time Masters champion did not realize that someone had lost their life. He only wanted to get to the course to warm up. Other PGA Tour players admitted to doing the same thing, but Scheffler had a \u201cbig miscommunication\u201d with the police. Given the time of day and the rainy conditions, eyewitnesses on the scene, namely ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington, who broke the story, also reported how difficult it was to see. Another video released early Wednesday also included Scheffler\u2019s perspective. Within that, Scheffler initially did not realize that the officer directing traffic was a police officer. Nevertheless, it looks as if everyone involved in this case can move on from the matter. Jack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation\u2019s Playing Through.

Romines did not comment in court.What happened?Scheffler, 27, was attempting to enter the Valhalla Golf Club in the early morning of May 17 in Louisville, Kentucky, to compete in Round 2 of the PGA Championship. He was detained around 6 a.m. for allegedly driving through a police cordon at the site of a fatal car accident outside of the golf club.The accident was not related to Scheffler. A man, who worked at Valhalla, died.The Louisville Metro Police Department released two videos last week, including one from a dash camera from a police car that showed a long line of cars passing the officers and their vehicles throughout the morning.Officers stopped traffic momentarily, moving some of their cars and the bus that was involved in the crash. A van goes around the bus and through where the police are at 6 a.m. One officer was waving on the van. The situation after is not seen in the dash camera's view.Another car had gone the same direction prior to the bus moving just a minute prior. An officer motioned with his arms for where that car should go.In the second released video, from the road, the car is seen making its way through the police. One officer runs up to the vehicle and seems to throw himself onto the front door. The officer continuously reaches into the window of the driver's seat, even putting his head and shoulders through the window. After the officer emerges, other officers surround the car as well.The car did not move again once the officer was interacting with it.The golfer's arraignment hearing was previously rescheduled to June 3. He was charged with four counts, including assaulting a police officer.The golfer's attorney Steven Romines defended his innocence and plans to litigate the case.\"Scottie Scheffler didn't do anything wrong,\" Romines said. \"We are not interested in settling the case... We are prepared to litigate.\"\"We are going to respect the legal process,\" Greenberg said. \"I'm very hopeful that on June 3, the next step in the legal process, that all parties are in a position to move forward.\"The injured detectiveDetective Bryan Gillis grabbed a hold of the car and Scheffler allegedly dragged him for several yards.Gillis was injured when Scheffler \"refused to comply\" with instructions and \"accelerated forward,\" according to the incident report. Gillis, however, did not activate his body camera.Gillis claims to have been dragged \"to the ground\" and suffered \"pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist.\"But there is no video from Gillis' body camera.\"Due to the confusion in the area at the time, his sense of urgency in responding to the fatal MVA and expediting traffic for the PGA championship, he failed to comply with powering it on,\" according to comments from Gillis's supervisor, Jeremy Allen.Louisville Metro Police Department policy requires officers to \"maintain their [body cameras] in a constant state of operational readiness\" and for them to \"immediately activate their [cameras] in recording mode prior to engaging in all law enforcement activities or encounters.\"At a press conference last week, Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel and Mayor Craig Greenberg announced how they \"want to move forward\" especially now that Gillis has gone through \"corrective action for\" the body camera policy.\"We understand the seriousness of failing to capture this interaction,\" Gwinn-Villaroel said.In a video posted by Max Mitchell, the founder of Flipping the Seen, the body camera footage from the officer interviewing Scheffler after the incident is seen.In the video Scheffler explains he did not know who the man was. He originally thought Gilis was a security guard and admitted he should have listened and pulled over. Gillis however \"didn't tell me he was a police officer\" and Scheffler admits to panicking.\"He grabbed my shoulder and hit me,\" Scheffler said. \"It seemed to be a little bit over aggressive.\"Back to the golf courseScheffler, who won his second major championship back in April at the Masters, was released around 8:40 a.m. that same day.He teed-off at 10:08 a.m. after he stretched \"in the jail cell,\" he said a press conference Friday.Scheffler posted a 5-under 66 par on Friday, remaining in contention for the tournament's victory. That all came undone, however, on Saturday when he finished with a 2-over 73 par, his worst score in almost a year.

Scheffler, 27, had been charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer and the lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. This is a breaking news update. Below is previous CNN coverage. A Kentucky county's top prosecutor and the attorney for world No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler will speak at a hearing in court Wednesday, 12 days after the PGA Tour star was arrested while trying to drive around the scene of a fatal crash while on his way to the PGA Championship in Louisville. Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell will address the court at 1 p.m. ET while attorney Steve Romines will appear on behalf of Scheffler, who lives in Texas and has permission to miss this hearing that only recently appeared on the court docket. Josh Abner, O'Connell's spokesperson, declined to comment on what Wednesday's hearing is about. Last week, Scheffler's arraignment was pushed back to June 3. Romines on Tuesday reiterated to CNN that Scheffler's position is the charges should be dismissed or he will go to trial without a plea deal. The Louisville-based attorney wouldn't say whether a resolution has been reached or whether charges will be dropped Wednesday. He has scheduled a news conference for just 30 minutes after the court hearing begins. Scheffler, 27, faces several charges, including felony second-degree assault on a police officer on suspicion of dragging an officer with his car while arriving at the Valhalla Golf Club early in the morning May 17. He also faces the lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. The date of the arraignment was pushed back after a request from his lawyer. Scheffler has called the incident a \"big misunderstanding,\" and Romines has said his client would plead not guilty. CNN spoke to sources in the police department who have said some officials believe the charges should be reduced. The prosecutors' office said Thursday it was still reviewing evidence and interviewing investigators about the charges. The golfer's arrest was a dramatic shakeup for the PGA Championship, given Scheffler - a new father who one golf writer described as an upstanding, \"squeaky clean\" player - was the overwhelming favorite on the heels of winning his second Masters title last month. He ultimately finished eight shots behind the winner, Xander Schauffele, for a share of eighth place. \"I did my best to leave that behind me and come out here and compete and do what I love, and the support I got from the fans was amazing,\" Scheffler told reporters May 19, following the tournament. \"I think they were cheering extra loud for me this week, and I got a lot of support from the players and caddies as well.\" 'A very chaotic situation' The arrest unfolded around 6 a.m. on May 17, when Scheffler was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the golf major and came upon heavy traffic near the scene of a fatal crash. Earlier in the morning, a pedestrian - John Mills, 69, whose family said he enjoyed working in security at Valhalla - was fatally struck by a bus while trying to cross the main road leading to the course, Louisville police spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said. As a result, police had an increased presence around the course's entrance. Scheffler - driving a marked player courtesy vehicle, according to ESPN - was trying to gain access to the course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket, a Louisville police report says. The officer, Detective Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \"Subject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\" the report states. The detective suffered pain, swelling and cuts to his left wrist and knee and was taken to a hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \"were damaged beyond repair,\" the report adds. At a news conference last week where video of the incident was released, Louisville Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the detective failed to turn on his body-worn camera and \"corrective action for the policy violation\" has been taken. Scheffler was detained and arrested, but he was later released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time four hours later. In a statement shared May 17 on his Instagram account, Scheffler said he believed he was following officers' instructions. \"This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers. It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,\" he said. \"I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\" Romines, Scheffler's attorney, similarly said his client \"did not do anything wrong,\" citing the accounts of multiple eyewitnesses. \"He stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\" Romines said in an earlier statement. \"We will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\" Despite spending part of his morning in a jail cell and getting his mug shot taken in an orange jumpsuit, Scheffler played well May 17 and shot 5-under par, leaving him near the top of the leaderboard. But he struggled the next day, leaving himself with too much ground to make up to clinch a second consecutive major. As for his apparent legal troubles, the golfer was unsure what would come next, telling reporters on May 19, \"I think it's all up in the air.\" \"I think I'm able to get home tonight but we'll see when I leave here,\" he said. \"I haven't really had much chance to assess the situation off the course.\" (The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The dismissal of charges brings to a close one of the strangest incidents in a bizarre era for men's golf. Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell announced during a Wednesday afternoon hearing that all charges against Scheffler would be dropped. O'Connell indicated that the county agreed that Scheffler's version of events did not rise to the level of criminal conduct, and the charges were dismissed with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled. The entire hearing lasted just six minutes. Scheffler, the World No. 1 player, was on his way to Valhalla for an early-morning tee time in the second round of the PGA Championship when he was stopped by police just outside the club's gates. Traffic had been halted around the club because of a fatal traffic accident involving a pedestrian roughly an hour before, and the pre-dawn scene was a chaotic blur of rain and flashing lights. Players were permitted to enter the club, and Scheffler attempted to do so even after being stopped by an officer. Video of the scene does not accurately capture what happened during the incident, because the officer, Det. Bryan Gillis, did not have his body cam turned on. Gillis claimed that Scheffler dragged him along the pavement, causing injury to Gillis and damage to his pants. Scheffler claimed that he stopped when told to, and accepted his arrest without significant protest. Video has emerged of Scheffler talking with an officer while in the backseat of a police car. Scheffler was booked and held briefly in jail before being released in time to make his tee time at Valhalla. He played well coming straight from jail, but struggled on Saturday and fell out of contention. Xander Schauffele went on to win the PGA Championship, having led or co-led wire to wire. Scheffler's arraignment was originally scheduled for the Tuesday after the tournament ended, but was postponed to June 3. Because Scheffler was charged with a felony, he would have needed to be present for any essential court proceeding, such as an arraignment. Thanks to the dismissal, Scheffler is now free to leave this entire episode behind him. He lost out on the opportunity to win a grand slam, finishing eight strokes behind Schauffele, but given how well Schauffele was playing, it's entirely possible Scheffler would have had difficulty keeping up even without the distraction of the Friday-morning incident.", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/charges-against-scottie-scheffler-dropped-in-police-incident-during-pga-championship-170247480.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DqoR8Nckg8TuWxemFqbTgQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/47cde390-1de0-11ef-9db7-4870c2d8e480", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 17:02:47", "author": "Jay Busbee", "authors": ["Jay Busbee"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.53}, {"id": 225124326, "title": "Charges against world\u2019s top golfer Scottie Scheffler dropped after arrest outside PGA Championship", "text": "By DYLAN LOVAN (Associated Press) LOUISVILLE, Ky.

Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell addressed the court Wednesday on a motion to dismiss the charges after he said his office conducted a \"thorough\" review of the case and could not proceed with the prosecution. Scheffler's characterization of the incident as a \"big misunderstanding\" was \"corroborated by the evidence\" and his actions \"do not satisfy the elements of any criminal offenses,\" O'Connell said. Judge Anne Delahanty approved the motion during the brief court appearance. Scheffler's attorney, Steve Romines, did not address the court. The golfer, ranked No. 1 in the world, was driving near the Valhalla Golf Club on May 17 when police alleged he ignored an officer's traffic command and injured the officer with his vehicle. He was arrested hours before his second-round tee time at the year's second major. Scheffler, 27, was arrested on charges of second-degree assault of a police officer -- a felony -- as well as third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding traffic signals from an officer directing traffic, according to police. He was scheduled to be arraigned on June 3. The arrest occurred about an hour after a deadly accident near the golf course. Around 5 a.m. that day, a man was fatally struck by a shuttle bus as he tried to cross a road near the course holding the PGA Championship, according to a statement released by the Louisville Metro Police Department. The victim was identified as PGA Championship volunteer John Mills. A police report alleged that Scheffler refused to comply with a police officer's request to stop and \"accelerated forward,\" dragging the detective to the ground. The officer -- identified as Detective Bryan Gillis -- was taken to the hospital after suffering \"pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist and knee,\" the report stated. In a police record, Gillis stated he was directing traffic following the accident in front of a gate. After PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering the gate, he stated that he stopped an approaching vehicle and advised the driver, Scheffler, he could not proceed due to the bus. \"He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions,\" Gillis wrote. \"I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\" Scheffler called the incident a \"big misunderstanding\" and said that he was \"proceeding as directed by police officers.\" \"It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,\" Scheffler said in a statement following his arrest on social media. \"I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\" Scheffler's attorney, Steve Romines, said in a statement to Louisville ABC affiliate WHAS that Scheffler was following orders from one officer and there was a \"miscommunication\" with the second officer who attempted to stop him. \"In the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer's traffic signals resulting in these charges,\" Romines said in the statement. \"Multiple eyewitnesses have confirmed that he did not do anything wrong but was simply proceeding as directed. He stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle.\" There is no body camera footage of the incident between Scheffler and the officer, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg previously told reporters. Gillis had a body-worn camera but had not switched it on, in violation of department policy, according to Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel. Following an internal investigation, Gillis received a corrective action for failing to turn on his body-worn camera, the chief announced on May 23.", "summary": "The golfer, ranked No. 1 in the world, was driving near the Valhalla Golf Club on May 17 when police alleged he ignored an officer's traffic command and injured the officer with his vehicle.", "url": "https://abc7news.com/post/scottie-scheffler-update-golfers-case-alleged-assault-louisville-court/14886132/", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14886194_052924-wpvi-scheffler-case-update-430a-vo-video-vid.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 17:29:46", "author": "ABCNews", "authors": ["ABCNews"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.711}, {"id": 225126982, "title": "Charges against world\u2019s top golfer Scottie Scheffler dropped after arrest outside PGA Championship", "text": "By DYLAN LOVAN (Associated Press) LOUISVILLE, Ky.

That spawned an internal investigation into whether proper police protocol was followed in the arrest of Scheffler. LMPD released two videos of Scheffler's arrest -- one from a fixed pole camera located across the street and another from a police vehicle's dashboard camera. Footage from the videos show Gillis running towards Scheffler's vehicle and banging his flashlight on the driver side window as the 2024 Masters champion is turning into the entrance of Valhalla. Both failed to capture the initial interaction between the two. The same day those videos were released publicly, a third was posted to Facebook of Scheffler's conversation with an officer in the police car during his arrest. It was not uncovered widely until Wednesday. Scheffler explained to the officer that he mistook the person stopping him as security guard and did not realize he was a member of the police: \"All I saw was a yellow jacket.\" Then he admitted his impatience in the moment given he was \"quite late for my tee time.\" Scheffler also claimed the arresting officer \"grabbed my shoulder and hit me\" after reaching in the car without identifying himself as police. According to the arrest report, the road on which Scheffler's incident occurred was closed in both directions following a fatal accident from earlier that morning. Scheffler allegedly \"refused to comply\" with Gillis' instructions, leading Scheffler to continue moving his vehicle forward with Gillis claiming he was dragged to the ground by the PGA Championship courtesy car. The officer received medical treatment after he \"suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee,\" and his uniform pants, valued at approximately $80, were \"damaged beyond repair.\" Throughout this ordeal, Scheffler's defense attorney, Steven Romines, has insisted his client did no wrong. He insisted there was zero interest in settling the case. Prepared to either go to trial or have the case dismissed, Romines and Scheffler have seen the latter come to fruition. \"We were pleased that the case was dismissed today. Obviously, dismissed with prejudice, which is something that we required,\" Romines said. \"We were prepared to go forward and litigate this matter. We were also prepared to litigate the case civilly. ... Whenever Scottie had to appear in court, we were going to begin the litigation regarding the civil matter. He does not wish to do that. He wants to move on.\"", "summary": "Scheffler will not face further discipline after a chaotic incident that nearly led to him missing the second round of the PGA Championship", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/scottie-scheffler-arrest-all-charges-dropped-against-world-no-1-as-new-video-of-traffic-incident-emerges/", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/21/95a79824-2514-4dcd-a967-c79e80335a12/thumbnail/1200x675/a6fd2f9c37873e23c0e1ae487d0d59c5/scottie-scheffler-usatsi.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 17:42:51", "author": "Patrick McDonald", "authors": ["Patrick McDonald"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.548}, {"id": 225133468, "title": "Charges against golfer Scottie Scheffler dropped after arrest outside PGA Championship", "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Criminal charges against Scottie Scheffler have been dismissed, ending a legal saga that began with images of the world\u2019s top male golfer being arrested and handcuffed in Louisville during the PGA Championship.

The arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis, was outside the gate of Valhalla Golf Course on May 17 directing traffic after a pedestrian death when he encountered Scheffler. The prosecutor said the findings of his office\u2019s review of the case led him to request the dismissal of the charges. \u201cThe evidence we reviewed supports the conclusion that Detective Gillis was concerned for public safety at the scene when he initiated contact with Mr. Scheffler,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cHowever, Mr. Scheffler\u2019s actions and the evidence surrounding their exchange during this misunderstanding do not satisfy the elements of any criminal offenses.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, was asked if he wanted to comment.

O'Connell addressed the court, as seen in a video stream from WDRB News, calling the events that led to 27-year-old Scheffler's arrest a \"confusing and chaotic scene\" on the morning before the second round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club. \"Based on the totality of evidence, my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr. Scheffler,\" O'Connell said on May 29. Scheffler was attempting to drive to the golf course, which had been taken over by a police scene after a man later identified as vendor John Mills was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus as he attempted to cross the street about an hour earlier. Traffic to the golf course had been stopped and the second round, previously scheduled to start at 7:15 a.m., had been delayed by PGA of America officials to 8:35 a.m. Scheffler, who welcomed son Bennett with his wife Meredith just days earlier on May 8, had tried to drive around the the crash by way of the median, and police said at the time that he ignored orders to stop. When Scheffler did stop the car, he was pulled out of the vehicle and placed in handcuffs. He was released around three hours later without bail and resumed playing at the tournament. Scheffler was facing a felony charge of second-degree assault of a police officer, as well as multiple misdemeanor charges including third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding traffic signals from an officer directing traffic before the charges were dropped. Soon after the tournament ended, in which Scheffler finished tied for 8th place, the city announced that there were errors in the police department's handling of the case. On May 23, Mayor Craig Greenberg and Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said that Detective Bryan Gillis had faced penalization after the LMPD found that he failed to activate his body-worn camera during Scheffler's arrest, which violates the department's standard operating procedures. According to a memorandum released by the Louisville Metro Police Department, Det. Gillis completed a Failure to Activate form, in which he explained his \"reason for not recording\" and \"what would have been captured\" if his body-worn camera had been activated. \"I was requested to respond to fatal on Shelbyville Rd. prior to my reporting time for the PGA. When I arrived I immediately started directing traffic in front of Gate 1, and never powered up my BWC,\" Det. Gillis wrote in the form. Describing what the body-worn camera would have captured, the detective wrote, \"While directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1. I observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could to proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\" According to CNN, Det. Gillis has faced \u201ccorrective action\" for the violation, though no further information was given on his penalization.

Scheffler and his attorney are \u201cpleased the case was dismissed today,\u201d lawyer Steve Romines told reporters outside court after the hearing. They had been prepared to litigate the case and also were preparing to file a civil suit that Scheffler no longer wants to pursue, Romines said, citing the cost to taxpayers. \u201cHe\u2019s glad it\u2019s over,\u201d Romines said of his Scheffler, who lives in Texas and had permission to miss Wednesday\u2019s hearing. The case has faced close scrutiny since the arrest on the early morning of May 17. The arresting detective was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time, and some officials had believed the charges should be reduced, police department sources told CNN. \u201cWe respect the County Attorney\u2019s decision, and we respect the judicial process,\u201d the department said Wednesday in a statement. Louisville Metro Police Department \u201cwill remain focused on our mission to serve the city of Louisville and mitigate violent crime.\u201d Scheffler had been charged in connection with the incident that occurred while he was arriving at the Valhalla Golf Club. He was accused of dragging a police officer who was directing traffic after a fatal accident that claimed the life of 69-year-old John Mills, a worker with a vendor for PGA of America, the organizer of the PGA Championship. Scheffler has called the episode a \u201cbig misunderstanding,\u201d and Romines on Wednesday strongly denied the officer had been dragged. The golfer\u2019s arrest was a dramatic shakeup for the PGA Championship, given Scheffler \u2013 a new father who one golf writer described as an upstanding, \u201csqueaky clean\u201d player \u2013 was the overwhelming favorite on the heels of winning his second Masters title last month. He ultimately finished eight shots behind the winner, Xander Schauffele, for a share of eighth place. \u201cI did my best to leave that behind me and come out here and compete and do what I love, and the support I got from the fans was amazing,\u201d Scheffler told reporters May 19, following the tournament. \u201cI think they were cheering extra loud for me this week, and I got a lot of support from the players and caddies as well.\u201d Romines has been in touch with Mills\u2019 family, and the golfer offered his condolences, the attorney told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe really wish to extend our condolences to the Mills family because these kind of tournaments can\u2019t go on without people like John Mills working out there,\u201d Romines said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tragic situation.\u201d \u2018A very chaotic situation\u2019 Wednesday\u2019s hearing unfolded as body camera footage surfaced showing an initial conversation Scheffler had with a law enforcement officer following his arrest. The blurry footage \u2013 apparently filmed at the arrest scene \u2013 is legitimate, a spokesperson for the Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. It appears to show an officer read Scheffler his Miranda rights before questioning the golfer about the incident. \u201cLMPD moved quickly to release footage of Mr. Scheffler\u2019s arrest on May 23rd, just days after the incident occurred,\u201d Scottie Ellis, the mayor\u2019s communications director, said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cAt the press conference where that footage was released, Mayor Greenberg stated that based on a request from the Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s Office, no other video would be released until the conclusion of the legal process,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt is unfortunate and very concerning that an individual leaked information that should have remained confidential until the completion of the investigation.\u201d The arrest unfolded around 6 a.m. on May 17, when Scheffler was trying to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the golf major and came upon heavy traffic near the scene of a fatal crash. Earlier in the morning, a pedestrian \u2013 Mills, whose family said he enjoyed working in security at Valhalla \u2013 was fatally struck by a bus while trying to cross the main road leading to the course, Louisville police spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said. As a result, police had an increased presence around the course\u2019s entrance. Scheffler \u2013 driving a marked player courtesy vehicle, according to ESPN \u2013 was trying to gain access to the course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket, a Louisville police report says. The officer, Detective Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d the report states. The detective suffered pain, swelling and cuts to his left wrist and knee and was taken to a hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. At a news conference last week where video of the incident was released, Louisville Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the detective failed to turn on his body-worn camera and \u201ccorrective action for the policy violation\u201d has been taken. Scheffler was detained and arrested, but he was later released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time four hours later. Scheffler that day said he believed he was following officers\u2019 instructions, according to a statement shared on his Instagram account. \u201cThis morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers. It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\u201d Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, similarly said his client \u201cdid not do anything wrong,\u201d citing witnesses\u2019 accounts. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d Romines said in an earlier statement. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Despite spending part of his morning in a jail cell and getting his mug shot taken in an orange jumpsuit, Scheffler played well May 17 and shot 5-under par, leaving him near the top of the leaderboard. But he struggled the next day, leaving himself with too much ground to make up to clinch a second consecutive major. As for his apparent legal troubles, the golfer was unsure what would come next, telling reporters on May 19, \u201cI think it\u2019s all up in the air.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m able to get home tonight but we\u2019ll see when I leave here,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really had much chance to assess the situation off the course.\u201d (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Jefferson County, Ky., attorney Mike O'Connell announced in court Wednesday all charges are dropped against golfer Scottie Scheffler due to a lack of evidence. Scheffler, 27, initially was charged with second-degree assault on a police officer, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic. \"Based on the totality of the evidence, my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges against Mr. Scheffler,\" O'Connell said in court Wednesday. \"Mr. Scheffler's characterization that this was a 'big misunderstanding' is corroborated by the evidence.\" Jefferson County District Court Judge Anne Delahanty dismissed the charges with prejudice, which means Scheffler cannot be charged at a future date. Delahanty also ordered the arrest record and charges to be expunged within 60 days. Scheffler's attorney, Steve Romines, told news media Scheffler is \"glad it's over\" and was prepared to fight the case and file a civil suit. Now, Scheffler won't pursue a civil suit with the case dismissed and to spare taxpayers any related cost, Romines said. The arresting officer who accused Scheffler of violating his commands and dragging him for 10 yards while \"attached\" to the SUV Scheffler was driving didn't have his body camera on during the incident. The officer and others were at the scene of a vehicular accident that killed a pedestrian near the entrance of the Valhalla Golf Course shortly before sunrise on May 17. Scheffler was scheduled to tee off at 8 a.m. and was driving an official tournament SUV when Det. Bryan Gillis allegedly commanded Scheffler to stop and then grabbed onto the SUV as Scheffler slowly drove past him. Gillis arrested Scheffler, who was processed and released in time to play the day's round, partly due to weather delays. Scheffler said another police officer had told him to proceed to the golf course, which he was doing at a slow speed when Gillis allegedly ordered him to stop.

Bao Li is the offspring of Bao Bao, who was born at the National Zoo in 2013. That makes Bao Li the grandchild of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, the zoo said. The name means \"treasure\" and \"energetic\" in Mandarin Chinese. The female bear, Qing Bao, was born in China on Sept. 12, 2021, the zoo said. Her name means \"green\" and \"treasure,\" the zoo said. Giant pandas were a staple at D.C.\u2019s National Zoo for over 50 years The National Zoo\u2019s longstanding resident pandas, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, departed D.C. last fall, along with their youngest offspring, Xiao Qi Ji, who was born at the zoo in 2020. After an emotional goodbye, the three went to new homes in the China Wildlife Conservation Association, leaving the National Zoo's giant panda habitat vacant for the first time in decades. Pandas first arrived at the National Zoo in the 1970s and evolved into D.C.'s unofficial mascots. The black-and-white bears appeared on Metro cards, street signs and statues around the District. The panda conservation program flourished after Tian Tian and Mei Xiang arrived 20 years ago. Mei Xiang gave birth to four surviving cubs, Tai Shan, Bao Bao, Bei Bei and Xiao Ji Qi \u2014 the first panda in the U.S. born after his mother was artificially inseminated with frozen, instead of fresh, semen. The agreement keeping Tian Tian and Mei Xiang was extended several times. The panda program has always served as a gesture of friendship and a sort of soft diplomacy between China and the United States, so the pullback of pandas at the National Zoo and other zoos in the United States caused some concern. Currently, there are only four pandas in the country \u2013 all at Atlanta\u2019s zoo. But in February, news that China plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo signaled the return of panda diplomacy. Despite the links to U.S.-China diplomacy, the negotiations are researcher-to-researcher and not based in politics, Smith, the National Zoo's director, told News4 last summer. \"We're a bunch of scientists; we're a bunch of animal people,\" Smith said. \"This is not a political conversation. This is absolutely a conversation between colleagues talking about, what's best for the overall program, and also, what can be best for individual animals?\" Want to know what's up for your weekend?

The San Diego Zoo said last month that staff members recently traveled to China to meet pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, which could arrive in California as soon as this summer.

Pandas have long been the symbol of the U.S.-China friendship since Beijing gifted a pair to the National Zoo in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later, Beijing loaned the pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back to panda conservation programs. \u201cI was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to see them off,\u201d Xi said in his speech.

It\u2019s possible that America will welcome another new panda pair before the Atlanta bears depart. The San Diego Zoo said last month that staff members recently traveled to China to meet pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, which could arrive in California as soon as this summer. Chinese President Xi Jinping had signaled during a trip in late 2023 that China would be sending new pandas to the United States. He called them \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d \u201cWe are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation, and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,\u201d Xi said during a speech with business leaders while he was attending a summit of Indo-Pacific leaders and meeting with President Joe Biden. Pandas have long been the symbol of the U.S.-China friendship since Beijing gifted a pair to the National Zoo in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later, Beijing loaned the pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back to panda conservation programs. \u201cI was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to see them off,\u201d Xi said in his speech. He added that he learned the San Diego Zoo and people in California \u201cvery much look forward to welcoming pandas back.\u201d When U.S-China relations began to sour in recent years, members of the Chinese public started to demand the return of giant pandas. Unproven allegations that U.S. zoos mistreated the pandas, known as China\u2019s \u201cnational treasure,\u201d flooded China\u2019s social media. The National Zoo said the pandas coming to Washington are: \u2014 Bao Li, a 2-year-old male whose name means \u201ctreasure\u201d and \u201cenergetic.\u201d He was born Aug. 4, 2021, at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan to father An An and mother Bao Bao. The zoo said Bao Li\u2019s mother was born at the zoo in 2013, and his grandparents Tian Tian and Mei Xiang lived at the zoo from 2000 to 2023. It was Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, along with their cub Xiao Qi Ji, who left the zoo in November. \u2014 Qing Bao, a 2-year-old female whose name means \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201ctreasure.\u201d She was born Sept. 12, 2021.

The first pandas were sent to the U.S. under then-President Richard Nixon, and first lady Pat Nixon donated them to the National Zoo. In the late 2010s, with a straining diplomatic relationship, China began not renewing contracts for pandas to remain in the U.S. In 2019, the pandas at the San Diego Zoo returned to China. Late last year, Washington\u2019s pandas also embarked on their return to China.

Now, National Zoo officials say D.C. will get two new adolescent pandas by the end of the year. The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair. \u201cWe're beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom -- the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China. For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos. Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China. Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat's not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says. The San Diego Zoo is also set to get a new pair of pandas sometime soon, but no date has been announced. The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was born at the National Zoo in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being sent to China in 2017. Bao Li\u2019s grandparents, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, lived at the National Zoo for 23 years before being returned to China last year. \u201cWe need that panda!\u201d Mariel Lally, one of the zoo\u2019s panda keepers, traveled with the bears in the FedEx cargo plane last year on their flight back to China. While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian. \u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn't believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan. \u201cThey're going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says. The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts. After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are no longer considered endangered. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials. At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn't pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales. About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see. \u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says. While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds. \u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.", "summary": "D.C.'s National Zoo will soon welcome a new pair of Giant Pandas", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2024/05/29/nx-s1-4977363/pandas-giant-dc-china-zoo", "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x4644+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2Fca%2Fafcf216a44f0af11625311319982%2Fgettyimages-1768923033.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:15:29", "author": "Jacob Fenston", "authors": ["Jacob Fenston"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.008}, {"id": 225048274, "title": "2 new giant pandas are returning to Washington's National Zoo from China", "text": "Washington's National Zoo is preparing to welcome a pair of new giant pandas by the end of the year about six months after it sent its three pandas back to China.The Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute was previously home to Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who were on loan from China for a research and breeding program. The two pandas and their baby, Xiao Qi Ji, won't be returning, but visitors will soon be able to meet Bao Li and Qing Bao, the zoo said in a news release. Bao Li, a 2-year-old giant panda, is the grandson of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. The second panda, Qing Bao, is also 2 years old. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. They will be transported to the United States by FedEx, which has previously shepherded pandas between the U.S. and China. As the pandas return, so too will the zoo's Panda Cam, which allows people around the world to check in with the pandas in real-time, according to Lonnie G. Bunch, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Pandas were first sent to D.C. in 1972 to help breed and continue the species. In a video shared on social media to announce the return of the pandas, zoo official Brandie Smith referred to the program as \"one of our biggest conservation success stories.\" Just a few zoos hosted the pandas while the program was in effect, including the National Zoo, the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee, and the San Diego Zoo in California. All three zoos returned their pandas as loan agreements lapsed and diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China heightened. The last pandas in the U.S. are at Zoo Atlanta and are expected to go back to China between October and December. A new pair of pandas is also expected to be sent to the San Diego Zoo as early as the end of this summer. The China Wildlife Conservation Association has also signed cooperation agreements with a zoo in Madrid, Spain, and was in talks for such an agreement with a zoo in Vienna, Austria. Pandas have long been a symbol of friendship between the United States and China since the first ones were sent to the National Zoo in 1972 ahead of the normalization of relations between the countries. The zoos also helped breed the pandas and boost the population of the species. There are just over 1,800 pandas left in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and although breeding programs have increased their numbers, the panda's survival is still considered at severe risk.

When Biden asks about attire and menu, Smith dryly replies that the impending guests are \u201cstrict vegetarians\u201d who are \u201cpartial to black and white.\u201d Last November, giant pandas Tian Tian and Mei Xiang and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, went back to China, prompting a nationwide outpouring of farewell from millions of U.S. panda fans of all ages. The trio\u2019s departure left only one panda family remaining in American zoos, at Zoo Atlanta, and those remain scheduled to return to China later this year. Zoo Atlanta is making preparations to return panda parents Lun Lun and Yang Yang along with their American-born twins Ya Lun and Xi Lun, zoo officials said earlier this month. There was no date for the transfer, they said, but it will likely happen between October and December. It\u2019s possible that America will welcome another new panda pair before the Atlanta bears depart. The San Diego Zoo said last month that staff members recently traveled to China to meet pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, which could arrive in California as soon as this summer.

Pandas have long been the symbol of the U.S.-China friendship since Beijing gifted a pair to the National Zoo in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations.

China will send a pair of 2-year-old pandas, male Bao Li and female Qing Bao, under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a press release, to the joy of panda fans throughout the D.C. area and the United States. \u201cThis longstanding program, and this collaboration with our Chinese colleagues, is one of the reasons why giant pandas are no longer listed as endangered, but rather only vulnerable, on the global list of species at risk of extinction,\u201d National Zoo director Brandie Smith said. Bao Li (BOW-lee), whose name means \"treasure\" and \"energetic\" in Mandarin Chinese, is related to the National Zoo\u2019s panda family: He is the son of Bao Bao, who was born in D.C. in 2013. That makes Bao Li the grandchild of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who lived at the National Zoo for about 23 years before returning to China last fall. Bao Li was born on Aug. 4, 2021, and lives at the Shenshuping Base in Wolong. \u201cThe panda\u2019s arrival is not just an exciting event, but it\u2019s proof positive of the success of our giant panda program,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBao Li is just as handsome as his uncles, Tai Shan and Xiao Qi Ji,\u201d Chinese ambassador Xie Feng said at a press conference Wednesday. \u201cI believe he is also excited for the upcoming trip from his hometown in Sichuan to D.C. to see the place where his family lived and get to know the friends here.\u201d As for Qing Bao (ching-BOW), \u201cShe is a star,\u201d Feng said. Qing Bao was the ambassador of the ninth World Wildlife Day when she was a year old. Her name means \"green\" and \"treasure.\". She was born on Sept. 12, 2021, and lives at the Dujiangyan Base in Sichuan. The announcement comes six months after the National Zoo\u2019s three iconic pandas left the zoo with an emotional goodbye as the conservation agreement expired. FedEx is set to fly the new pair to the United States in its \u201cPanda Express service.\u201d The animals will be quarantined for at least 30 days, and then allowed to settle in for a few weeks before the panda exhibit opens to the public. \u201cThe public debut date will be announced as soon as the animal care team feels the bears are ready to meet visitors,\u201d the zoo said. Under the new agreement, the National Zoo will pay $1 million per year to the China Wildlife Conservation Association to \u201csupport research and conservation efforts in China,\u201d according to the zoo. That money does not come from federal funding, according to the zoo. The National Zoo says it is looking to raise $25 million to pay for renovations to the panda exhibit; maintain and upgrade the Giant Panda Cam; pay for costs of operating the panda exhibit and support conservation efforts. China will retain ownership of the bears and any cubs must be returned to China by the age of 4. The Chinese ambassador says he hopes the agreement will bring joy to a new generation of families. \u201cOver the past five decades, pandas have held a special place in the childhood memories of numerous Americans. Today, many of those happy kids have become grandpas and grandmas, dads and moms themselves. They look forward to taking their kids to the zoo to tell their stories with pandas and start new ones for their little boys and girls,\u201d Feng said. Giant pandas were a staple at D.C.\u2019s National Zoo for over 50 years The National Zoo\u2019s longstanding resident pandas, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, departed D.C. last fall, along with their youngest offspring, Xiao Qi Ji, who was born at the zoo in 2020. The three went to new homes in the China Wildlife Conservation Association, leaving the National Zoo's giant panda habitat vacant for the first time in decades. Pandas first arrived at the National Zoo in the 1970s and evolved into D.C.'s unofficial mascots. The black-and-white bears appeared on Metro cards, street signs and statues around the District. The panda conservation program flourished after Tian Tian and Mei Xiang in 2000. Mei Xiang gave birth to four surviving cubs, Tai Shan, Bao Bao, Bei Bei and Xiao Ji Qi \u2014 the first panda in the U.S. born after his mother was artificially inseminated with frozen, instead of fresh, semen. The agreement to keep Tian Tian and Mei Xiang was extended several times. The panda program has always served as a gesture of friendship and a sort of soft diplomacy between China and the United States. The pullback of pandas at the National Zoo and other zoos in the United States sparked some concern. Currently, there are only four pandas in the country \u2013 all at Atlanta\u2019s zoo. But in February, news that China plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo signaled the return of panda diplomacy. Despite the links to U.S.-China diplomacy, the negotiations are researcher-to-researcher and not based in politics, Smith, the National Zoo's director, told News4 last summer. \"We're a bunch of scientists; we're a bunch of animal people,\" Smith said. \"This is not a political conversation. This is absolutely a conversation between colleagues talking about, what's best for the overall program, and also, what can be best for individual animals?\"", "summary": "<p>Giant pandas are set to return to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., by the end of the year, officials announced Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China will send a pair of 2-year-old pandas, male Bao Li and female Qing Bao, under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a press release, to the joy of panda fans throughout the D.C. area and the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis longstanding program, and this collaboration with our Chinese colleagues, is one of the reasons why giant pandas are no longer listed as endangered, but rather only vulnerable, on the global list of species at risk of extinction,\u201d National Zoo director Brandie Smith said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bao Li (BOW-lee), whose name means &#8220;treasure&#8221; and &#8220;energetic&#8221; in Mandarin Chinese, is related to the National Zoo\u2019s panda family: He is the son of Bao Bao, who was born in D.C. in 2013.

China's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng told Reuters on Wednesday that the new panda cooperation agreement was \"a very good sign\" for U.S.-China relations. OUTSIDE OF CHINA, PANDAS ARE ONLY FOUND IN THESE 5 ZOOS AROUND THE WORLD \"To deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples, today I am very glad to share with you some good news,\" he said during remarks at the zoo, announcing that the two pandas named Bao Li and Qing Bao will be headed to Washington.

PANDAS TO RETURN TO SAN DIEGO ZOO AS CHINA BRINGS BACK 'PANDA DIPLOMACY' Bao Li is a two-year-old male. His mother was born at the institute in 2013 and his grandparents Tian and Mei Xiang lived at NZCBI from 2000 to 2023. Qing Bao is a two-year-old female born to Qing Qing and mother Jia Mei. Once they arrive, the pair of pandas will be quarantined for 30 days and then have a few more weeks to settle into their new habitat, the zoo said. A public debut date has yet to be set. The departure of the three pandas from the zoo last November as loan agreements lapsed left Georgia's Zoo Atlanta as the only one in the United States with giant pandas, and that loan deal is set to expire later this year. Chinese President Xi Jinping hinted that he was open to sending more of the \"envoys of friendship\" to the U.S. after meeting President Joe Biden in November in California, where the two men agreed to step up communication despite an intensifying geopolitical rivalry. Xi's remarks prompted the White House to say the U.S. would \"absolutely welcome\" the bears. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP China's communist government has long used \"panda diplomacy\" to enhance the country's soft power, lending the large but cuddly-looking black-and-white bears to zoos in various countries over the decades as goodwill animal ambassadors. Wednesday's announcement is a clear sign of Beijing's approval of stabilized ties with Washington. Beijing presented two giant pandas as gifts to the U.S. in 1972 after President Richard Nixon's historic Cold War visit to the country. Other pandas have since been loaned to the U.S. for research and educational purposes, and the bears have perennially been a top attraction at zoos, drawing millions of adoring visitors.

Panda diplomacy Pandas were first loaned to the National Zoo in the Nixon administration, when formalized national relations between the two countries were formed. For decades, China has loaned pandas to countries it hoped to build ties with, a policy referred to \u201cPanda Diplomacy:. Last year, though, China rescinded those on loan, not only from the U.S. but also from zoos in Scotland. Tensions between the U.S. and China started to heighten during the Trump administration, when sanctions were added to many Chinese-made products, but have increasingly deteriorated. Washington has attempted to deprive China of cutting-edge computer chips, citing national security concerns. Pandas are native to China and zoos that host them are never given full custody. Instead, they \u201crent\u201d them, paying hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to China each year. Long a member of the endangered species list, pandas are no longer considered at severe risk and were downgraded to \u201cvulnerable\u201d to the threat of extinction in 2021.

The news offered a glimmer of hope for US-Chinese relations, which have cooled in recent years amid mounting concerns over the future of Taiwan and economic competition. Last fall, when the zoo said goodbye to its last remaining pandas, there was speculation that China would not sign off on sending more of the animals to Washington, despite the country\u2019s 50-year partnership with the Smithsonian. In its press release, the zoo confirmed that the agreement on the new pandas, which is effective through April 2034, mirrored the terms of past projects. The pandas and any cubs they produce will remain under the ownership of China, and cubs born at the zoo will return to China by the age of four. The agreement will also allow the Smithsonian to conduct panda-related research projects with partners in China.

Chinese President Xi Jinping had signaled during a trip in late 2023 that China would be sending new pandas to the United States. He called them \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d The zoo accompanied the announcement with a light-hearted video featuring Smith, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III and first lady Jill Biden. The trio in the video are gathered to discuss protocol for a reception to welcome unnamed honored guests. When Biden asks about attire and menu, Smith dryly replies that the impending guests are \u201cstrict vegetarians\u201d who are \u201cpartial to black and white.\u201d Last November, giant pandas Tian Tian and Mei Xiang and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, went back to China, prompting a nationwide outpouring of farewell from millions of U.S. panda fans of all ages. The trio\u2019s departure left only one panda family remaining in American zoos, at Zoo Atlanta, and those remain scheduled to return to China later this year. Zoo Atlanta is making preparations to return panda parents Lun Lun and Yang Yang along with their American-born twins Ya Lun and Xi Lun, zoo officials said earlier this month. It\u2019s possible that America will welcome another new panda pair before the Atlanta bears depart. The San Diego Zoo said last month that staff members recently traveled to China to meet pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, which could arrive in California as soon as this summer. A separate agreement was also announced to send a breeding pair of pandas to San Francisco as well. Pandas have been a symbol of U.S.-China friendship since Beijing sent a pair to the National Zoo in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later, Beijing loaned pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back to panda conservation programs. When U.S-China relations began to sour in recent years, members of the Chinese public started to demand the return of giant pandas. Unproven allegations that U.S. zoos mistreated the pandas, known as China\u2019s \u201cnational treasure,\u201d flooded China\u2019s social media. The National Zoo said the pandas coming to Washington are: \u2014 Bao Li, a 2-year-old male whose name means \u201ctreasure\u201d and \u201cenergetic.\u201d He was born Aug. 4, 2021, at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan to father An An and mother Bao Bao. The zoo said Bao Li\u2019s mother was born at the zoo in 2013, and his grandparents Tian Tian and Mei Xiang lived at the zoo from 2000 to 2023.

A research and breeding agreement with the Chinese runs through April 2034 and, like previous ones, says any cubs born at the zoo will move to China by age 4, according to the announcement.

It's official the pandas are coming back to DC,\" Dr. Biden exclaims in the video while holding a panda stuffed animal. Moments of people reacting in excitement are shown through short clips as it is also said that, in addition to being able to see the pandas at the zoo which offers free admission, people from \"across the globe\" will be able to watch them via the \"panda cam.\" Last November, three giant pandas left the zoo to return to China after the zoo\u2019s Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association expired. The agreement, started in December 2000, was renewed three times. The departure of the three bears marked the first time the National Zoo had been without pandas since 2000.

Following the quarantine period, the bears will have \"a few more weeks to settle into their new habitat.\" The public debut date will be announced at a later time. Pandas first came to Washington D.C. in 1972, and shortly after, the species was classified as \"endangered.\" In a 2022 interview with PEOPLE, Janine Brown, who leads the endocrinology lab at the institute, reflected on the \"true collaboration\" between China and the U.S., as well as with other zoo programs around the world. \"They want their flagship species to survive, and we obviously want it as well.

Calls for conservative Justice Samuel Alito to recuse himself from certain Supreme Court cases began ... [+] after reports that symbols supporting former President Donald Trump were displayed at his home. Getty Images Key Facts Alito, a conservative justice on the court, said in a letter to Congress on Wednesday that his wife was the reason the two flags with symbols associated with Jan. 6 and Trump were flying at his houses in recent years, saying that means he does not need to recuse himself. Alito argued in the letter that his wife has a First Amendment right to display what she wants outside of their homes\u2014one of which is jointly owned and one that is \u201ctitled in her name\u201d\u2014and that he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in the decisions to fly the flags. Alito wrote the letter in response to Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who requested a meeting with Chief Justice John Roberts last week to ensure that Alito recused himself in cases related to the 2020 election because of the \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d Earlier this month, The New York Times reported the upside-down flag was outside of the Alitos\u2019 home in 2021, and a second flag tied to Trump supporters was displayed outside the home last year. Crucial Quote \u201cAs I have stated publicly, I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention. As soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused,\u201d Alito wrote in the letter.

Democrats, including top senators, recently urged Justice Alito to recuse after it was found an upside-down American flag flew outside his home and a historical \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag flew at his beach house. Justice Alito, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said the senators are mistaken. The code of conduct says that a justice should recuse in a proceeding where his or her impartiality \u201cmight reasonably be questioned\u201d or \u201cwhere an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.\u201d The upside-down American flag does not introduce such doubt, Justice Alito said, because his wife was the one who put it up, not him. He said later, \u201cI am confident that a reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that the events recounted above do not meet the applicable standard for recusal.\u201d As for the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag, which is also known as the Pine Tree Flag and has been flown in America since the 1700s, Justice Alito says that was also flown by his wife. \u201cI had no involvement in the decision to fly that flag,\u201d the justice said. When he saw the flag, he thought it was being flown to \u201cexpress a religious and patriotic message\u201d and did not know of any connection to a group that has promoted election fraud claims. Neither was Martha Ann Bomgardner Alito, his wife, the justice said. \u201cShe did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings,\u201d Justice Alito said. The justice sent a similar letter to members of the House of Representatives who had also called for his recusal. \u201cEven if you had \u2018no involvement\u2019 in the display yourself, the fact of such a political statement at your home creates, at minimum, the appearance of improper political bias,\u201d the members said. They pointed to a part of the code of conduct that says justices should \u201cshould refrain from political activity.\u201d The Supreme Court is currently considering a number of cases involving President Trump and Jan. 6, including a case about whether the former president has immunity from prosecution for acts he carried out while in office. Some Republicans have said that Justice Alito should not recuse over the flags. \u201cHistorically, the \u2018Appeal to Heaven Flag\u2019 stood for freedom/self-government - the very basis for our revolution against Britain,\u201d Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said on social media recently. \u201cI condemn the demonization of this flag and support Justice Alito\u2019s right to fly it.\u201d", "summary": "Justice issues rare letter to Democrats.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-courts-alito-responds-to-calls-to-recuse-from-trump-cases-5659003", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/15/id5608211-samuel-alito-LSedit-3-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 18:07:34", "author": "Zachary Stieber", "authors": ["Zachary Stieber"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.014}, {"id": 225146178, "title": "Alito Rejects Calls to Step Aside from Supreme Court Cases Because of Flag Controversies", "text": "More Must-Reads from TIME How Selena Gomez Is Revolutionizing the Celebrity Beauty Business Javier Milei\u2019s Radical Plan to Transform Argentina How Private Donors Shape Birth-Control Choices What Happens if Trump Is Convicted ?

Neither incident at Alito\u2019s homes merited his recusal, wrote the justice, who has rejected calls from Democrats in the past to recuse on other issues. \u201cI am confident that a reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that the events \u2026 do not meet the applicable standard for recusal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am therefore required to reject your request.\u201d Supreme Court justices decide for themselves whether to sit out a case and the only potential consequence for refusing to step aside is impeachment by the House of Representatives and removal from office by the Senate. That has never happened in American history. Trump, who was in New York while jurors deliberated in his hush money criminal trial, congratulated Alito for \u201cshowing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u2018GUTS\u2019\u201d in refusing to step aside. \u201cAll U.S. Judges, Justices, and Leaders should have such GRIT,\u201d Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. Some Senate Republicans also quickly took to social media Wednesday to praise Alito for staying involved in the cases. The court is considering two major cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by a mob of Trump supporters on the Capitol, including charges faced by the rioters and whether Trump has immunity from prosecution on election interference charges. The New York Times reported that an inverted American flag was seen at Alito\u2019s home in Alexandria, Virginia, less than two weeks after the attack on the Capitol. The paper also reported that an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag was flown outside the justice\u2019s beach home in New Jersey last summer. The \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag has in recent years come to symbolize sympathies with the Christian nationalist movement and the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump. According to Americanflags.com, the pine tree on the flag symbolized strength and resilience in the New England colonies while the words \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d stemmed from the belief that God would deliver the colonists from tyranny. An upside-down American flag has come to be a symbol associated with Trump\u2019s bogus fraud claims. Dozens of the pro-Trump rioters were carrying similarly inverted flags and chanting slogans like \u201cStop the Steal\u201d on Jan. 6, 2021. The U.S. Flag Code states that the American flag is not to be flown upside down \u201cexcept as a signal of dire distress in instance of extreme danger to life or property.\u201d The inverted flag has been used as a protest symbol on both the left and the right on a range of issues over the decades. Alito said he was unaware that the upside-down flag was flying above his house until it was called to his attention. \u201cAs soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused,\u201d he wrote in nearly identical letters to Democrats in the House and the Senate. He had previously explained to the newspaper that his wife put up the flag as part of a nasty neighborhood dispute. The flag at his beach house was also hoisted by his wife, Alito wrote, noting that the house is in her name and was bought with money she inherited from her parents. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags. I am not,\u201d he wrote. Alito said he was unfamiliar with the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag when it was flown, but he noted it dates back to the American Revolution. \u201cI was not aware of any connection between this historic flag and the \u2018Stop the Steal Movement\u2019 and neither was my wife,\u201d Alito wrote. He said Martha-Ann Alito did not fly that flag to associate herself with the rioters or the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Trump, a Republican, lost to Joe Biden, a Democrat. Calling her an independently-minded private citizen, Alito wrote, \u201cShe makes her own decisions and I honor her right to do so.\u201d Democrats in the House and the Senate sent a total of three letters last week to Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts seeking Alito\u2019s disqualification from the cases. Senators asked for a meeting with Roberts. Alito said it was better that he respond directly. Judicial ethics codes focus on the need for judges to be independent, avoiding political statements or opinions on matters they could be called on to decide. The Supreme Court had long gone without its own code of ethics, but it adopted one in November 2023 in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices. The code lacks a means of enforcement, though, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation last year that would set stricter standards.

The letters follow two New York Times reports that said an upside down American flag was flown outside the home Alito shares with his wife in Virginia and that an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag was flown outside the couple\u2019s New Jersey vacation home. Both flags have been linked to supporters of former President Trump who falsely believe that the 2020 election was stolen. In the letters, Alito reiterated that it was his wife\u2019s decision to fly both flags, adding that neither he nor his wife was aware of the modern political connotations associated with the flags. The Supreme Court, where Alito and his fellow conservatives enjoy a 6-3 supermajority, is considering two cases related to Jan. 6. The first relates to Trump\u2019s claims of immunity in his federal election interference case; the second is an appeal brought by a man convicted for his role in the Capitol riot. Decisions in the cases are expected this summer. Democratic lawmakers argued that the flags outside Alito\u2019s home meant he was unable to be impartial in the cases. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d He said the upside down U.S. flag was in response to a \u201cvery nasty\u201d dispute with a neighbor that made his wife \u201cgreatly distressed.\u201d \"A house on the street displayed a sign attacking her personally and a man who was living at the house trailed her all the way down the street and berated her in my presence using foul language, including what I regard as the vilest epithet that can be addressed to a woman,\" Alito wrote. Alito wrote that he had asked his wife to take it down once he became aware of it, but she declined for several days. \u201cMy wife is a private citizen, and she possesses the same First Amendment rights as every other American,\u201d he added. The Times reported that a couple in the neighborhood had a dispute with Martha-Ann Alito and had at one point called the police because they felt she was harassing them. The couple told the newspaper that their dispute occurred after the flag was taken down. The second flag that has stirred controversy was at the Alito\u2019s beach house in New Jersey. It is a flag that dates back to the American Revolution bearing the legend \u201cAn Appeal to heaven,\u201d but in recent times it has come to be associated with Christian Nationalism and the Stop the Steal movement. Alito said in his letter that neither he nor his wife was aware of that association, and that in any event, it is Mrs. Alito who is the flag-flier in the family, erecting flag poles at both residences and flying a wide array of flags, including flags \u201cthanking veterans, college flags, flags supporting sports teams\u2026flags of places we have visited, seasonal flags, and religious flags.\u201d Alito acknowledged that the beach home flag may have flown over the couple\u2019s vacation home for \u201csome period of time\u201d in the summer of 2023, but he had \u201cno involvement in the decision to fly that flag.\u201d Moreover, he observed, \u201cOur vacation home was purchased with money [Mrs. Alito] inherited from her parents and is titled in her name.

Alito Jr. told Congress on Wednesday he would not step aside from cases involving former President Donald Trump, in the wake of news reports that two flags tied to the effort to overturn the 2020 election were flown outside his properties. In a pair of letters to Democrats in the Senate and House, Alito rejected the request from the lawmakers that he recuse himself in a case about whether Trump as a former president is immune from criminal charges, as well as cases related to the 2020 election or the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Alito, one of the most conservative members of the Supreme Court, cited the court\u2019s code of conduct that justices should disqualify themselves when an unbiased person might reasonably question their impartiality. The flag-flying incidents did not meet those conditions, Alito wrote, and implied that efforts to get him to recuse were based on a desire to influence the result. \u201cA reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am therefore duty bound to reject your recusal request.\u201d Alito detailed how his wife was responsible for flying an upside-down American flag outside their Virginia home in the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at the couple\u2019s New Jersey beach home in 2023. The New York Times first reported both incidents earlier this month, sparking a flurry of congressional criticism and calls for Alito to recuse himself from the Trump case. The news reports said supporters of Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election had also displayed the flags. Senate Judiciary Chair Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., wrote to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. last week asking for a meeting about Alito and ethics issues more broadly. Durbin and Whitehouse wrote that the flag displays called Alito\u2019s impartiality into question and dovetailed with long-standing concerns about the court\u2019s ethics. \u201cBy displaying the upside-down and \u2018Appeal to Heaven\u2019 flags outside his homes, Justice Alito actively engaged in political activity, failed to avoid the appearance of impropriety, and failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary,\u201d the senators wrote. Alito also responded to a letter sent directly to him by Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., and 44 other House Democrats. In that letter, the lawmakers called for Alito to recuse himself from the Trump case and a second one involving charges stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. \u201cEven if you had \u2018no involvement\u2019 in the display yourself, the fact of such a political statement at your home creates, at minimum, the appearance of improper political bias,\u201d the House Democrats\u2019 letter said. Alito wrote that he had no involvement in the decision to fly either flag, and actually asked his wife to take the flag at their Virginia home down several times. Alito said she flew an upside-down American flag amid a dispute with neighbors. \u201cShe makes her own decisions and I honor her right to do so,\u201d the letter said. Separately, Alito said his wife made the decision to fly a flag known as the \u201cAppeal to Heaven,\u201d a white flag which carries those words above a conifer tree, outside his wife\u2019s vacation home in New Jersey. The flag, which was carried by supporters of Trump throughout his first term, was also carried by rioters who stormed the Capitol. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has flown the flag outside his congressional office. Alito said his wife mentioned the flag had historical roots dating back to the American Revolution, and that neither of them were aware of its modern use by those connected to the attack. \u201cThe use of an old flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings,\u201d the letter said.

The release said Lee was found guilty in a September 2007 trial, but fled before he was sentenced.

Lee was dubbed the \u201cBad Breath Rapist\u201d after the media learned one of the pieces of evidence that established Lee as the assailant was his foul breath. According to the U.S. Marshals Service, Lee was believed to have fled Massachusetts. His whereabouts were unknown until Massachusetts State Police investigators developed information on the fugitive earlier this year that indicated he was possibly staying in Diablo, a census-designated place in Contra Costa County a couple miles away from the East Bay suburb of Danville. Investigative leads were sent to the U.S. Marshals Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force (PSWRFTF) in northern California, who worked with the Danville Police Department to determine it was Lee who was living in the area. On Tuesday, officers with the Massachusetts State Police Violent Fugitive Apprehension Section (VFAS) and the Quincy Police Department arrested Lee with assistance from the USMS Massachusetts Fugitive Task Force and Danville police. \u201cAny cold case is very unique.

Massachusetts State Police later confirmed that Lee was taken into custody after a motor vehicle stop conducted by Danville officers. Lee initially provided a fake name, but ultimately confessed when authorities pressed him about his true identity. Police were able to confirm his identity with fingerprints. \u201cWe were constantly told it\u2019s a very tight, close-knit neighborhood. And if there was any kind of police presence that every neighbor would hear about it, and we didn\u2019t want to give up the thoughts it was there,\u201d said Chris Tamayo, senior inspector for U.S. Marshals Service. \u201cThis is going to probably be a big shock. Hopefully, it doesn\u2019t cause them any concerns that the fact that someone was hiding here.\u201d State police noted that the female companion was with at the time of his arrest never knew who he really was despite being together in California for 15 years.

On Tuesday, the Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force (PSWRFTF) in Northern California, as well as Massachusetts State Police, the Massachusetts Fugitive Task Force, and the Quincy Police Department worked together to arrest Tuen Kit Lee, 55. A jury had previously found Lee guilty of kidnapping and raping a woman back in 2005, but he fled during his trial in 2007 before sentencing. According to reports, Lee had raped a waitress who was working at his family-owned restaurant after breaking into her home on February 2nd, 2005. Investigators stated that Lee \u201cwore a mask and held the victim at knife point\u201d before zip-tying her to the bed and raping her. Over an hour later, the victim\u2019s boyfriend eventually decided to check on her after he was unable to reach her. Once the boyfriend walked in the room, he found her bound to the bed, in distress. Lee was identified by the victim by his \u201cbad breath,\u201d which led him to acquire the name \u201cBad Breath Rapist.\u201d The Massachusetts State Police was later tipped off by an anonymous caller who said that Lee might be residing in Diablo, California. In order to look into the anonymous tip, state police got in touch with U.S. marshals in northern California, and they were able to confirm that he was indeed in the region.

The U.S. oil and gas industry has been riding a consolidation wave over the last two years. Last year was one of the most active, where M&A deals worth $250 billion were struck. The momentum has carried over into this year as the stock market continues to boom and as U.S. oil production scales new records. Conoco's all-stock offer equates to $30.33 per Marathon share, representing a premium of nearly 15% as of the stock's Tuesday close, according to Reuters calculations. The transaction, which includes $5.4 billion of Marathon's debt, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. It expects cost savings of $500 million within the first full year after the closing of the transaction. The acquisition adds over 2 billion barrels of reserves to ConocoPhillips' portfolio. Marathon Oil has operations in the Bakken basin in North Dakota, Permian basin in North Delaware and South Texas' Eagle Ford basin - regions that are prime targets for producers looking to increase their inventory. Marathon Oil shares were up 5.5% at $27.22, while Conoco shares were down about 3% in premarket trading. \"This acquisition of Marathon Oil further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading U.S. unconventional position,\" ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said. The deal follows U.S. majors Exxon Mobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources that was announced in October, and Chevron's proposed $53 billion merger with Hess that was approved by the latter's shareholders on Tuesday. The consolidation activity in the industry has, however, attracted increased antitrust scrutiny, with the FTC reviewing multi-billion dollar deals, including those involving Chevron, Diamondback Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Chesapeake Energy. RBC analysts termed the Marathon deal as a \"surprise transaction,\" but see the asset mix fitting well and strengthening ConocoPhillips' onshore assets while building on its global LNG presence. ConocoPhillips also added that it would dispose of nearly $2 billion worth of assets. The company plans to increase its base dividend by 34% from the fourth quarter of 2024 onwards. After the transaction closes, it aims to buy back more than $7 billion in shares in the first full year.

A ConocoPhillips oil field in Alaska in 2019. The Washington Post via Getty Images Key Facts The all-stock deal values Marathon Oil at $17.1 billion, knocking off the $5.4 billion in debt included in the total transaction value for the Houston-based companies, both of whom engage in oil and natural gas exploration and production. That\u2019s a 15% premium from the company\u2019s $14.9 billion market capitalization at Tuesday\u2019s close. Shares of Marathon Oil surged 11% in premarket trading following the announcement, with the spread from the transaction value indicating investor angst surrounding the inevitable regulatory scrutiny any M&A deal, especially in energy, faces. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips shares slipped 1%, steeper than broader stock market losses, as shareholders grappled with the typical concerns of dilution and newfound debt that major acquisitions often bring.

ConocoPhillips is the third-largest American oil company by market value, trailing only Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Both Exxon and Chevron have announced massive acquisitions of their own over the past year. Exxon closed earlier this month on its $60 billion all-stock purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources, while Chevron is on the cusp of completing its $54 billion of Hess, whose shareholders approved the merger on Tuesday. Surprising Fact Global M&A activity has been far slower over the last 18 months compared to the dealmaking surge during the pandemic, as higher interest rates globally make the debt financing typically used in such transactions much pricier. But deals in energy, which tends to be a higher consolidation sector anyways due to the high upfront costs associated with the businesses, have been prolific thanks to elevated commodity prices, strong balance sheets and a slowdown in the shift away from fossil fuels, according to PwC.

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images ConocoPhillips ConocoPhillips announced plans to acquire Marathon Oil Marathon Oil Corporation through an all-stock transaction valued at $22.5 billion, including $5.4 billion in net debt. Marathon Oil shareholders will receive 0.2550 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Marathon Oil common stock, reflecting a 14.7% premium over Marathon's closing share price on May 28, 2024, and a 16.0% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average price. The deal, subject to Marathon Oil shareholder approval, regulatory clearance, and customary closing conditions, is expected to be finalized in Q4 2024. \u201cThis acquisition enhances our portfolio by adding high-quality, low-cost inventory adjacent to our leading U.S. unconventional position,\u201d stated Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO. \u201cWe share similar values and operational philosophies, and this move will be immediately beneficial to our earnings, cash flows, and shareholder distributions. Significant synergies are expected.\u201d Lee Tillman, Marathon Oil Chairman, President, and CEO, expressed pride in Marathon's achievements and confidence in ConocoPhillips' ability to build on their legacy. \u201cWith its robust asset base, financial strength, and operational excellence, ConocoPhillips is the ideal partner to enhance our assets and provide significant long-term shareholder value.\u201d Transaction Benefits The acquisition is anticipated to be immediately accretive to ConocoPhillips' earnings, cash flow, and return of capital per share. ConocoPhillips projects at least $500 million in annual cost and capital savings within the first year post-closing, achieved through reduced administrative costs, lower operating expenses, and improved capital efficiencies. The acquisition will enhance ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 portfolio, adding over 2 billion barrels of resources with a forward cost of supply estimated at less than $30 per barrel WTI.

Following the transaction closure and assuming current commodity prices, ConocoPhillips plans to repurchase over $7 billion in shares within the first year and over $20 billion within three years. Ryan Lance added, \u201cWe remain committed to returning over 30% of cash from operations to shareholders and will continue targeting top-quartile dividend growth.\u201d Criticisms Critics of the deal immediately emerged. The Make Polluters Pay Campaign issued a press release warning that the deal could further consolidate the oil industry's power and delay a transition to clean energy is urgently needed. \"As oil and gas companies continue to merge and acquire one another, it raises serious questions about the industry's commitment to reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner forms of energy,\" said Cassidy DiPaola, Communications Director for the Make Polluters Pay Campaign. \"These deals, worth tens of billions of dollars, suggest that major players are still betting heavily on a future dominated by fossil fuels.\" The deal will also likely be criticized by some politicians who will cite antitrust issues. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been stepping up antitrust reviews for energy companies. For instance, the FTC requested additional information from Exxon and Pioneer regarding their proposed deal, which is a standard step in assessing whether a merger could be anticompetitive under U.S. law. It is a safe bet that this will be the case with the ConocoPhillips acquisition as well. Disclaimer: I worked for ConocoPhillips from 2002 to 2008. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Comfort is subjective and no one pillow is right for everyone, so we prefer pillows that are adjustable, so you can fine-tune the feel, firmness and height to suit your own preferences. Since it offers amazing adjustability as well as impressive organic certifications, we picked the Avocado Green Pillow as the best pillow for combination sleepers. The best pillows for combination sleepers allow you to sleep in any position with a healthy ... [+] alignment. Illustration: Forbes / Photos: Retailers While you may spend the majority of your time in one pose, your pillow should keep your neck and spine aligned no matter how you\u2019re lying, whether it\u2019s on your back, curled up on your side or on your stomach. Your pillow should also meet other personal preferences such as temperature regulation, material and of course your budget. Ahead, we\u2019ve rounded up our favorite pillows for combination sleepers, keeping all of these factors in mind. Best Overall Pillow For Combination Sleepers: Avocado Green Pillow (Queen) Best Budget Pillow For Combination Sleepers: Marlow The Pillow (Standard) Best Cooling Pillow For Combination Sleepers: Coop EdenCool+ Adjustable Pillow (Queen) Best Pillow For Neck Pain For Combination Sleepers: Purple Freeform Pillow (Standard) Best Memory Foam Pillow For Combination Sleepers: Layla Kapok Pillow (Queen) Best Organic Pillow For Combination Sleepers: Naturepedic Organic Adjustable Latex Pillow (Queen) Best Down Pillow For Side Sleepers: Boll & Branch Down Chamber Pillow (Standard) Best Overall Pillow For Combination Sleepers Lofty And Supportive Avocado Avocado Green Pillow (Queen) Fill: GOLS-certified organic latex, GOTS-certified organic kapok tree fiber | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 1 year | Firmness: Adjustable Pros: Adjustable fill Multiple organic certifications Reasonably priced Cons: Washable liner must be dried flat or line-dried There are so many reasons to love this pillow. For starters, it\u2019s cushy with a hefty yet soft organic cotton cover that doesn\u2019t make you feel hot and sweaty after a few hours. It also boasts an array of third-party organic certifications. The adjustable fill in this pillow consists of Global Organic Textile Standard (GOLS)-certified organic latex foam ribbons and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic kapok, a type of tree fiber with a fluffy consistency. The GOTS-certified organic cotton quilted cover is soft and thick, as well as machine-washable and can be hung to dry. It\u2019s also Greenguard Gold Certified, so you know you\u2019re not breathing in VOCs and other chemicals all night long. The dual filling stays bouncy and keeps its loft over time. But if you ever need to add (or subtract) any, you can unzip the liner and adjust the fill accordingly. While it comes with an extra fill bag, you can also purchase additional refill packages if you want to plump things up even more. These pillows are available in standard, queen and king sizes. What the editors say: \u201cI\u2019ve been using this pillow for a couple of years now, and it does not disappoint,\u201d says Forbes Vetted commerce editor Margaret Badore. \u201cAs a stomach sleeper, I didn\u2019t need the extra filling, but I appreciate that you have the option to plump it up. The latex shreds give this pillow a weighty, substantial feel, and the pillow\u2019s cover is thick and plush, like a fantastic sweatshirt.\u201d Best Budget Pillow For Combination Sleepers Inexpensive, With A 365-Day Trial Period Marlow Marlow The Pillow (Standard) Fill: Memory foam, polyester fiber | Trial period: 365 days | Warranty: 2 years | Firmness: Adjustable Pros: Longest trial period in the industry Easy zipper sides to adjust firmness level Cons: Spot clean only No organic certifications If you\u2019re looking for a budget pick, you can\u2019t go wrong with this wallet-friendly choice. Unlike most other adjustable pillows which require you to add or take away handfuls of messy fill, this pillow uses zippers to adjust its firmness level. Zip both sides for a firmer feel, unzip one side for a medium firmness and unzip both sides for its softest feel. The memory foam is infused with cooling gel so you don\u2019t sleep hot. Marlow also gives you plenty of time to decide whether or not its pillow is right for you: You\u2019ve got a generous 365 days to return it for a refund. The pillow comes in two sizes, standard and king. If you need more than one pillow, pillow bundles of two or four pillows are discounted. The only real downside with these pillows is that they can only be spot-cleaned, so we suggest using a pillow protector and replacing your pillows regularly, especially if you have allergies. What the reviews say: \u201cThese pillows are absolutely perfect. They offer the right amount of support and crisp cool material that eliminates overheating. I got all of my family members a pair, and they have also purchased more for their spare bedrooms.\u201d Best Cooling Pillow For Combination Sleepers Extra Cooling Features For Hot Sleepers Coop Sleep Goods Coop EdenCool+ Adjustable Pillow (Queen) Fill: Memory foam\u2013microfiber blend | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 5 years | Firmness: Adjustable Pros: Adjustable fill Utilizes several cooling technologies Cons: Pillow cover may feel uncomfortably slippery to some users This pillow uses different types of cooling technologies to keep hot sleepers from waking up sweaty. A cool gel, microfiber and memory foam blend, plus a cool touch fabric outer cover and heat-wicking inner liner contribute to its cooling properties. The company says the plus-shaped pieces of memory foam also help promote better air flow to improve cooling. Although the pillow is suggested for stomach sleepers, you can easily add or remove fill to make it less plump if you\u2019re primarily a side sleeper. It also comes with additional fill to beef it up if the height isn\u2019t tall enough for you. You can feel good that it\u2019s earned Greenguard Gold and CertiPUR-US certification so you aren\u2019t breathing in chemicals and VOCs. One downside is that the cooling outer cover is most effective if not used with an additional pillow case, so it won\u2019t match your sheets, if that matters to you. The plus is that this cover can be machine washed and tumbled dry. It comes in queen and king sizes. What the reviews say: \u201cAmazingly customizable loft and stays cool all night long. Took me a few nights to dial in how much filler to use, but absolutely fantastic now.\u201d Best Pillow For Neck Pain For Combination Sleepers Optional Neck Rolls To Reduce Pain Purple Purple Freeform Pillow (Standard) Fill: Foam, hyper-elastic polymer | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 1 year | Firmness: Adjustable Pros: Adjustable fill Neck roll chambers can be filled for additional support Cons: Cover cannot be tumble dried This pillow feels different from most because it\u2019s encased in a honeycomb gel grid that gently cradles your head. The foam filling pieces offer support without feeling as if you\u2019re sinking too deep. The neck roll chambers store extra fill on the long sides of the pillow to offer correct neck and spine alignment, which is especially useful for alleviating neck pain. The gel grid is CleanAir GOLD\u2013 and CertiPUR-US\u2013certified so you aren\u2019t inhaling chemicals all night long. The cover is slightly stretchy, and it\u2019s machine-washable, though you need to dry it flat. Any excess fill you remove when you customize the height can be stored in an included throw pillow case. You can purchase additional fill, too. The pillow comes in standard and king sizes. What the reviews say: \u201cI love the customizability of the Freeform\u2014the neck chambers and the different height options. It took me a few days to find the perfect fill amount, but once I did, I love this thing.\u201d Best Memory Foam Pillow For Combination Sleepers With The Cooling Properties Of Kapok Tree Fiber Layla Layla Kapok Pillow (Queen) Fill: Memory foam, kapok tree fiber | Trial period: 30 nights | Warranty: 5 year | Firmness: Adjustable Pros: Adjustable fill Kapok offers cooling properties Cons: Not recommended to be machine washed If you like the feel of memory foam but are worried it sleeps hot, this combination pillow uses memory foam with kapok tree fibers to improve air flow and cooling. The combination of materials feels both soft and supportive. The polyester viscose\u2013blend pillow cover is washable, while the pillow itself can be spot treated or washed on gentle in your machine, though the company says this may void the warranty. The foam is CertiPUR-US certified. This pillow comes in both queen and king sizes. What the reviews say: \u201cI used to sleep with four to five pillows and now am able to sleep comfortably with two Layla queen size pillows. Being able to remove the stuffing in the pillow for your own comfort is amazing.\u201d Best Organic Pillow For Combination Sleepers Impressive Organic Certifications Naturepedic Naturepedic Organic Adjustable Latex Pillow (Queen) Fill: Latex, organic cotton fiber| Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 1 year| Firmness: Adjustable Pros: Adjustable fill Multiple organic certifications Cons: Some reviewers commented that the pillow case felt \u201cbumpy\u201d due to the stitching If you don\u2019t like the idea of breathing in chemicals and VOCs all night long, a pillow that has earned organic certifications is the way to go. This one contains GOLS- or FSC-certified latex, which tends to sleep cooler than memory foam but still provides a combination of support and squishiness. You also can purchase it in three comfort levels (soft, medium and 2-in-1) and three different sizes. The latex is cut into small pieces, rather than shredded, to promote better airflow and cooling properties. The fill is encased with organic cotton jersey so that you can easily remove the GOTS-certified cotton cover for washing. It\u2019s machine-wash and dry, too, which is not the case with many other brands. The products also are Greenguard-certified for low chemical emissions. Plus, all pillows are made in the United States. What the reviews say: \u201cI am so happy with this purchase. There was no weird smell like other similar brands, and it\u2019s beyond comfortable. I rarely have to adjust the pillow at all. I\u2019ve owned many expensive pillows, but this takes the cake.\u201d Best Down Pillow For Side Sleepers Plush, Supportive Feel With Cruelty-Free Down Boll & Branch Boll & Branch Down Chamber Pillow (Standard) Fill: Ethically sourced down | Trial period: 30 days | Warranty: None | Firmness: Soft, medium, firm Pros: Ethically sourced down Can be machine-washed and dried Cons: Not adjustable Many people prefer down for its unique loft and cushy feel. This pillow, while not adjustable, comes in three different firmness levels to accommodate stomach (soft), back (medium), and side (firm) sleepers. The down fill is cruelty-free IDS-certified and is triple-washed to retain softness, and the cover is organic cotton. Unlike many other types of fill, this down is machine-washable and can be tumbled dry (using dryer balls can help speed up the process and keep the down fluffed up). The manufacturer suggests washing once per season, so we recommend using a pillow protector to keep it clean and prolong its lifespan. It comes in standard and king sizes. One downside is that the company does not have a warranty policy. However, a customer service representative we reached out to said they send all issues to their quality-assurance team for review and possible replacement. It\u2019s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it is something to be aware of if you purchase this pillow. What the editors say: \u201cThis pillow is dream worthy,\u201d says former mattress and sleep editor Lindsey Vickers. \u201cIt quickly became one of my favorite pillows, as the soft version has the ideal level of cushion for me as a stomach sleeper. I find it has the give and compression that I love about down, but I\u2019m also relieved the fill materials are ethically sourced, because that\u2019s equally important to me.\u201d MORE FROMFORBES VETTED Why Are Mattresses So Expensive? A Pricing Guide\u2014And How To Get Deals By Nicole M. LaMarco Contributor The 7 Best Hair Dryers For Curly Hair To Enhance Your Natural Texture By Stephanie Montes Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted sleep team has vast knowledge and experience with testing and reviewing all types of bedding products. We also have an always updated library of pillow recommendations. The author of this story, Arricca SanSone, has written pillow reviews, mattress reviews and covered a sanity-saving blanket for Forbes Vetted. Some of her other bylines are MSN, Cosmopolitan, ELLE and Good Housekeeping. Our mattress and sleep editors, Bridget Chapman and McKenzie Dillon, are certified sleep science coaches and have tested almost every pillow on the market between them. We incorporated the expertise and insight of other Forbes Vetted editors with firsthand experience with the pillows. In an effort to bring you the most accurate and current products to improve your sleep, we review and fact-check our recommendations frequently. This article was last updated in May 2024. How We Chose The Best Pillows For Combination Sleepers To create our list of the best pillows for combination sleepers, we primarily focused on brands that offer adjustability. We also asked informed colleagues for their recommendations, compared attributes and certifications and paid attention to reviews from real consumers. We sought out pillows with organic certification to ensure you\u2019re not breathing in smelly, toxic VOCs every night. We factored in a product\u2019s trial period. We especially like pillows with a lengthy trial time and free returns so you can test them out in real life with no risk to your wallet. We asked Forbes Vetted editors for their experiences and reviews with specific pillows. In addition, we combed through hundreds of reviews, specifically looking at negative feedback. Products with a number of poor reviews were rejected, especially if the customer service did not stand up to its hype after the sale. What To Look For In The Best Pillows For Combination Sleepers Adjustable Fill And Loft The best fill type depends on your personal preference. It\u2019s important for combination sleepers to be able to add or remove the amount of fill to customize the height and firmness level of the pillow to accommodate different sleeping positions. Care Look for pillows with removable, washable covers. Few pillows, especially those made of memory foam, can be machine-washed. Many manufacturers recommend spot cleaning only, which means you should replace your pillow regularly\u2014especially if you have allergies. Size Most pillows come in standard, queen or king size options. It\u2019s personal preference, but note that king size pillows don\u2019t fit well on queen beds or smaller. Organic Certifications Various organic certifications by third-party organizations ensure products are better for human health and the environment and may include: Global Organic Textiles Standard (GOTS): A textile with the GOTS label must meet strict criteria through the supply chain using organic raw materials and contain a minimum of 70% certified organic fibers, which are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and herbicides. Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS): GOLS certification products must contain at least 95 percent organically grown natural rubber latex. Forest Stewardship Council (FSC): The FSC-certification confirms latex products meet criteria for sustainable sourcing. GreenGuard Gold: Products that are GreenGuard certified have been tested for more than 11,000 VOCs to show they have lower chemical emissions to reduce the number of VOCs released inside your home. CertiPUR-US: CertiPUR certification means products are made without formaldehyde, phthalates, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals and have low VOCs for improved indoor air quality. International Down Standard: The International Down Standard (IDS) ensures products contain down that has been ethically sourced from responsible farms that respect the welfare of ducks and geese. What Type of Pillow Is Best For All Sleep Combinations? Combination sleepers are those of us who sleep in different positions throughout the night. If you tend to switch between your back and side or you occasionally stomach-sleep, you may want to invest in an adjustable pillow that can be tweaked according to your preference. Another option is to find a pillow that is available in multiple height options. Most manufacturers also specify which type of pillow is best for combination sleepers. Additionally, consider purchasing a pillow with a long trial period and free returns so you can test it in real life to see if it\u2019s the right fit for you.

There\u2019s so much to experience in the fresh air, and walking is an excellent form of exercise. You\u2019re probably prepared with sunscreen, a sun canopy and appropriate clothing, but it\u2019s essential to know that you\u2019ll need to consider temperature regulation in warm weather. As the American Academy of Pediatrics explains, children are less able to regulate their body temperature than adults. The best stroller fans work to keep your little one cool in warmer weather. Illustration: Forbes / Photos: Retailers \u201cUnlike us adults, babies don't have the same ability to regulate heat, making it crucial for parents to ensure they stay cool and cozy while on the move,\u201d says Laura Hunter, a pediatric nurse and co-founder of Moms On Call. She explains, \u201cA stroller fan can become your trusty sidekick. By circulating air within the confined space of the stroller, these handy devices can help lower the temperature by a few degrees, ensuring your little one stays comfortable and content throughout the journey.\u201d There are many factors to consider when buying a stroller fan, including safety, speeds, oscillation, additional features and attachment mechanism. To create this list, we considered multiple factors and consulted a medical expert and experienced parents, along with user reviews, to find the best stroller fans of 2024. Best Stroller Fan Overall: Amacool Stroller Fan Best Ultra-Quiet Stroller Fan: Snawowo Baby Stroller Fan Best Foam-Bladed Stroller Fan: Dreambaby Deluxe Clip-On Fan Best Bladeless Stroller Fan: Skip Hop Portable Bladeless Stroller Fan Best Stroller Fan For Travel: KidCo Buggygear Portable Fan Best Multi-Purpose Stroller Fan: Pure Enrichment Purebaby On-The-Go Air Purifier Best Stroller Fan Overall A Versatile Fan That\u2019s Useful Well Beyond The Stroller Years Amazon Amacool Stroller Fan This fan is an affordable and versatile pick that can serve you well beyond the stroller years. Thanks to bendable tripod legs, this fan can attach anywhere\u2014on a stroller, wagon, baby beach tent, crib, or the side of mom or dad\u2019s treadmill. Lightweight, the fan measures just 5 inches, and the fan slots are very narrow to prevent unwanted fingers from touching the blades. The fan\u2019s head rotates 360 degrees and can blow air at three speeds, so it\u2019s a cinch to get the positioning exactly where you need. In addition to the varying speeds, an LED nightlight has three brightness levels, so you can use this to help peek at a sleeping baby. Hopefully sleep is no problem, since the fan is particularly quiet at just 30 decibels, though the faster speeds are noticeably noisier. The fan is powered via a rechargeable battery. Battery life can last from 2.5 to 10 hours, depending on use, so it might need recharging if you plan a long day out. Choose from three colors\u2014black, pink and blue. Best Ultra-Quiet Stroller Fan Don't Disturb A Sleeping Baby Amazon Snawowo Baby Stroller Fan If you\u2019re looking for a fan that won\u2019t create too much noise, this affordable option has a 20-decibel noise rating, one of the lowest we\u2019ve seen. The fan is quite powerful and provides plenty of cooling breeze at just 5 inches in diameter. The flexible silicone tripod base is durable and easy to clean. Three \u201coctopus\u201d arms allows you to position the fan in any way that suits your needs. We appreciate that the fan head can rotate 360 degrees for easy positioning, and an ultra-fine mesh layer prevents little fingers from slipping in and touching the blades. This pick has three wind speeds and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 16 hours. Users praise that this fan comes with a USB to C-cord charger, which is much more durable and readily available. A full recharge takes about three to four hours. This quiet fan is available in four colorways to match your stroller style. Best Foam-Bladed Stroller Fan Safer For Little Fingers Amazon Dreambaby Deluxe Clip-On Fan If the idea of foam blades feels safer to you, this affordable pick is a good option. While we don\u2019t recommend kiddos playing with the fan, if they do touch the blades, they are made of foam and will simply bend to the touch. The simple clip-on style is simple to use, but know you won\u2019t get the full speed, breeze and power of other fans on our list. For an alternative use, this fan will also sit flat on a flat surface, so it could be positioned to cool a baby in a crib or a parent working at a desk. This fan runs on two AA batteries, so while rechargeable AA batteries are an option, know that you might face an issue where this fan runs out of power while you're out and about. On the flip side, as long as you keep this fan well-stocked with batteries, you\u2019ll never have to charge it. Best Bladeless Stroller Fan Don't Worry About Fan Blades Amazon Skip Hop Portable Bladeless Stroller Fan If the idea of a bladed fan makes you nervous or if your child seems to grab onto everything, a bladeless stroller fan could be just what you need. This fan is easy to set up but has less flexibility than some of our list's bladed, more portable stroller fans. Along with the fan body, there\u2019s an adjustable universal base that gets attached to your stroller\u2014while attaching it isn\u2019t difficult, it\u2019s a bit time-consuming. It makes this option a bit harder to move around, but it is possible to leave the base attached to your stroller. The fan body is removable and gets charged via a USB cable. The fan is only available in grey and has three speed settings, though reviewers say it doesn\u2019t perform as well as its bladed counterparts. If a bladeless design is vital to you, just know there\u2019s some sacrifice in performance. Best Stroller Fan For Travel A Packabe Fan Amazon KidCo Buggygear Portable Fan This mini fan is perfect for travel since its small size means it can easily be stashed in a travel bag. There are three speeds, ultra-quiet blades and a finger protection safety barrier, which makes this a versatile choice. While it can be used as a safe, hand-held option, a silicone strap attaches the fan to a stroller or car seat. It\u2019s a bit more challenging than the simple clip-on style of our other picks, but once you get the hang of it, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Besides its small size, we like the fact that this fan has a flashlight feature, which is helpful for traveling. Light the way on darker stroller walks or use the flashlight to navigate an unfamiliar hotel room. Additionally, the fan has a built-in USB charging port to charge other electronic devices\u2014key in a hotel room without many outlets. The battery can last up to six hours, according to the manufacturer. Best Multi-Purpose Stroller Fan Breathe Easy Pure Enrichment Pure Enrichment Purebaby On-The-Go Air Purifier Keep the air around your baby clean and gently moving with this 2-in-1 gadget: an air purifier and a fan. This is a useful addition if your baby is sensitive to allergens like dust, pollen, pet hair, dander or other odors. The lightweight, portable air filter filters 6 square feet of space around your baby while doubling as a fan, providing three breeze speeds. The set has an adjustable clamp that rotates 360 degrees, making it easy to attach to a stroller. The filter/fan body has a removable HEPA filter and an activated carbon pre-filter, so the air passes through a two-stage system. Along with the fan/filter body, it comes with one removable filter and a USB C charging cord. A fully charged battery lasts about 12 hours, according to Pure Enrichment.

LaMarco Contributor The 7 Best Hair Dryers For Curly Hair To Enhance Your Natural Texture By Stephanie Montes Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted The parenting team at Forbes Vetted cares deeply about helping our readers find safe and valuable products for your families. We know how important it is to ensure an item\u2019s safety before introducing it to your child, and stroller fans are no exception. We\u2019ve reviewed and tested hundreds of baby and kids gear items, from diaper bags to humidifiers. The author, Maya Polton, is a mom of three kids. She has extensive experience covering baby and kids gear. For this story, we spoke to Laura Hunter, a licensed pediatric nurse and co-founder of Moms On Call, an education resource for parents. This article was first published in May 2024. It will be reviewed and updated regularly. How We Chose The Best Stroller Fans To select the best stroller fans, we took a thorough look at the options currently available. We interviewed parents to see what they look for, like, and don\u2019t like about stroller fans. Our medical expert shared her thoughts on what to look for when shopping for a stroller fan. We deeply researched the market, looking for readily available, high-quality, affordable and highly rated stroller fans. Additionally, we examined best-selling stroller fans, sorted through reviews, and considered whether they matched the feedback received from the expert interviewed. What To Look For In The Best Stroller Fans Safety A safe and secure stroller fan should be your priority. \u201cWhen it comes to using a stroller fan to keep your little one cool and comfortable during outdoor adventures, safety is paramount,\u201d says Hunter. She advises parents to \u201clook for stroller fans with child-safe designs, such as enclosed blades, foam blades and/or mesh covers, to prevent tiny fingers from getting caught.\u201d Secure Attachment The best stroller fans on our list attach to the stroller in various methods, from clips, \u201coctopus\u201d legs and other mechanisms. No matter how your fan attaches, make sure it\u2019s completely secure and out of reach of your baby. Hunter says, \u201cThe last thing you want is to hit a bump in the road and have the fan fly off into the stroller or onto the ground.\u201d Battery Life And Charging An uncharged stroller fan is no help to anyone. Choose a stroller fan that is easy and convenient to charge for your lifestyle and create a routine to keep it regularly charged. Hunter shares, \u201cA long-lasting battery ensures uninterrupted cooling during extended outings, while USB charging compatibility adds convenience.\u201d Remember that to charge the fan, you\u2019ll likely need to remove it from the stroller, so having a fan that is easy to regularly install and take off is critical.

The cotton-poly blend fabric is soft and quick-drying, while he zippered pockets keep your golf gear secure. The tailored fit is also sleek when you\u2019re on the move.

For this piece, Rotchford interviewed pros and serious players at clubs around the country for their top picks. These include Mark Anderson, head golf professional at The Oaks Club in Osprey, Florida and Michael Crawford, head golf professional at Woodway Country Club in Darien, Connecticut. Forbes Vetted\u2019s deputy editor, Kari Molvar, also weighed in on the top-rated options, based on her expertise in the market and time spent evaluating athletic wear. This article is regularly updated to ensure our selections remain the best of the best; it was recently updated in May 2024 by fashion writer Claire Epting. How We Chose The Best Golf Shorts When making our product selections for this list, we evaluated each item based on the most important criteria for golf shorts, including fit, performance and size options. We sought out popular, highly reputable brands that are known for creating high-quality athletic apparel, including Under Armour and Lululemon. We tapped our expert sources for their own personal golf short recommendations. Anderson\u2019s top pick is the Adidas Ultimate365, while Crawford likes the G/Fore Maverick. We considered a range of options to suit a variety of budgets. The most wallet-friendly picks land below $50, while our higher-end pairs sit around the $100 mark. What To Consider When Buying Golf Shorts When shopping for golf shorts, there are a few things you should consider, including material, fit, color and extra features. Here\u2019s a breakdown on each to simplify your search. Material The comfort of golf shorts largely hinges on their material. Many golf shorts are made of a polyester-spandex blend, which not only provides flexibility but also wicks away moisture, ensuring you stay dry throughout your round. Some shorts are even water-resistant, so you won\u2019t get soaked in the rain. For those playing in sunnier climates, consider shorts with built-in UV protection to shield against prolonged sun exposure. Meanwhile, men who prefer a classic look can opt for traditional chino shorts. This type of short is mostly cotton, with a hint of spandex for stretch. Just keep in mind that chino shorts are more prone to wrinkling than polyester ones. Fit And Style Golf requires a wide range of motions\u2014swinging, walking, crouching to read greens, bending down to pick up balls\u2014 so the cut of the shorts needs to accommodate a variety of movements. However, they should still look tailored and polished, while feeling nearly as comfortable as your workout shorts. Avoid shorts that are too tight, as this can make it harder to turn through your swing. And, since golf shorts should ideally hit just above the knee, choose a pair with an 8-inch inseam unless you are very tall, in which case you might want look for a brand that offers a 10-inch inseam. Color Most golf clubs have a dress code. While certain rules will be clearly stipulated\u2014you always need to wear a collared shirt and a belt, and your shirt needs to be tucked in at all times\u2014other guidelines may be implied, such as the color of your shorts. Traditional shades like khaki, navy and gray continue to be staples on the golf course; they make a great foundation for your athletic wardrobe. That being said, in recent years bright colors and pastels\u2014aqua, red, light blue\u2014have become popular and widely accepted. Extra Features Some shorts come equipped with features like extra deep pockets to hold balls, a pocket to tuck your phone, zippered pockets and magnetic scored card pockets. Having a few of these extra features can help you feel more organized while you play, but Anderson suggests keeping as much gear as possible in your bag. \u201cI personally don\u2019t like my students to keep anything in their pockets, as it can be a deterrent from their swing,\u201d he says. Some shorts even have built-in gripper tape on the waistband to keep shirts neatly tucked in.

After extensive testing and analyzing features such as cushioning, arch support, traction and heel drop, I landed upon the best walking shoes for women. My top choice overall is the Brooks Ghost 15, which has a supportive, versatile design. The Under Armour UA Essential Sportstyle Shoe wins for the best value walking shoe because it provides excellent cushioning and breathability at a lower price, and the On Cloud 5 is the best lightweight option. I tested dozens of sneakers to find the best walking shoes for women, depending on your fitness ... [+] goals and foot type. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailers Here are all the best walking shoes for women, with my full reviews on each further down in this piece: Best Walking Shoes For Women Overall: Brooks Ghost 15 Best Lightweight Walking Shoe For Women: On Cloud 5 Best Cushioned Walking Shoes For Women: Hoka Clifton 9 Best Supportive Walking Shoes For Women: Sorel Kinetic Impact II Best Affordable Walking Shoe For Women: Under Armour UA Essential Sportstyle Best Walking Shoes For Women With Arch Support: New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v13 When selecting shoes to test, I asked a board-certified podiatrist, orthopedic surgeon and certified trainer for their expert opinions. I focused on brands known to be leaders in the walking industry and looked at shoe models that were both athletic and lifestyle-oriented to cover a variety of footwear needs. Below, find my top selections, as well as a handful of newer styles I\u2019m excited to test out next. Best Walking Shoes For Women Overall The Most Cushioned, Stable And Comfortable Walking Shoes Brooks Running Brooks Ghost 15 Weight: 7.9 ounces | Lacing system: Traditional |Heel drop: 12 mm | Size range: 5 to 13; medium, wide, narrow | Colors: 32 total, including Blue/Black and White/Crystal Grey Best for: Serious walkers and active people who stay on their feet all day People who do multiple activities and sports, including walkers who likes to run or cross-train Heel strikers and those who want extra cushioning without decreasing stability Skip if: You want a very lightweight shoe; this is a mid-weight option and the extra shock absorption in the heel might add unnecessary bulk for you This pair tops our list of the best walking shoes because it\u2019s the most versatile option for different styles of walkers and those who want a supportive, multi-purpose sneaker. It\u2019s extremely stable, with a grippy outsole, for both speed walks and less intense jaunts along smooth and uneven surfaces. The cushioned EVA foam midsole absorbs shock during the heel strike (when your heel hits the ground), should you also do higher-impact aerobic stints, such as running. Overall, there\u2019s little activity you can\u2019t do comfortably in the Brooks Ghost, and it\u2019s the shoe I now wear most consistently among all the ones tested. The Ghost is equipped with a curved insole to reduce arch stress\u2014which is great if you suffer from sore tendons, are flat-footed or stand for long periods of time. The Ghost also has a firm heel counter (the part of the shoe that wraps around the back of your ankle) to hold the foot in place and prevent over-pronation, or rolling your ankles. Note that I tested version 14 of this shoe, but the 15 is newer and more widely available online. With a 12 mm heel drop, the Ghost\u2019s heel is a smidge higher than the standard 10mm for running sneakers. These shoes have a 4.25 cm heel stack (height) and 9.1 ounce weight, which was mid-range compared to other sneakers I tested: this is a moderately cushioned shoe, which is a good thing since extra padding can decrease stability. The Brooks Ghost is moderately cushioned, which is a good thing: too much padding can decrease ... [+] stability. Kari Molvar For Forbes Vetted The Ghost didn\u2019t propel my foot forward on an arc like a rocker-sole shoe, which has a curved bump in the midsole. But it did add bounce to my step, thanks to the air-pocket-filled foam core. I found this feature helped me move nimbly around fallen tree branches and pivot easily without losing my balance, which has been an issue for me with rocker-sole shoes in the past since your foot is not on an even plane. The mesh upper on the Ghost sneakers is lightweight and extremely breathable; on 90-degree days, my feet did not sweat through my socks. If you\u2019re a dedicated walker, who also likes to run\u2014I logged 84 miles in this pair\u2014and tackle different activities in a day, you won\u2019t find a better sneaker than the Brooks Ghost. The 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing. Best Lightweight Walking Shoe For Women Airy, Flexible And Stylish Shoes MOST POPULAR On On Cloud 5 Weight: 6.9 ounces | Lacing system: Speed laces with knotted cord; traditional laces included as well | Heel drop: 2.5mm | Size range: 5 to 11 | Colors: 13 total, including Blueberry/Feather and Nimbus/Alloy Best for: Those who want a lightweight, responsive shoe that can handle all surfaces Walkers with a slightly narrow to medium-width foot Those who need a stylish option to wear for workouts and everyday Skip if: You have wide feet You prefer extra cushioning or need a high-drop shoe for heel issues If you\u2019re looking for a lightweight, all-day walking shoe with a barely-there feel, the On Cloud 5 is about as perfect of a shoe you can find. It weighs just 6.9 ounces, the airiest of the ones we tested. It\u2019s ideal for covering long and short distances, handling different terrains with stability and supporting your arches without adding bulk. On, a relatively new Swiss brand founded in 2010, has a dedicated following for its unique midsole: It\u2019s designed with holes that allow air to pass through and help the shoe compress vertically and laterally as you land. The design aims to cushions your feet to reduce muscle strain and also enables a smoother toe-off, or launch for your foot, allowing you to move easily through your stride. I filmed slow-motion videos of my foot as I walked in this shoe versus others and noticed a subtle lift at the end of my gait cycle. Additionally, Annabelle Lemes, the Connecticut-based trainer I spoke to, cited this pair as her top pick. \u201cI\u2019m always on my feet, and On\u2019s are my very first choice.\u201d With a minimal heel drop of 2.5mm and a very firm insole, the On Cloud 5 shoes are a great choice ... [+] for people who want to move swiftly and confidently over rugged trails, cobblestone streets or changing terrain. Kari Molvar For Forbes Vetted The Cloud has a minimal heel drop of 2.5mm and a very firm insole, making this shoe a good, stable choice for those with balance issues or anyone who wants to move fast but securely over rugged trails, cobblestone streets or changeable terrain. The heel counter scored a moderate firm rating as well. These shoes held my foot snugly in place, almost as firmly as the Brooks, with an ankle collar that didn\u2019t extend over my bone or cause chafing. The mesh upper is breathable and outfitted with thin reflective bands, which is a nice (and stylish) safety feature if you walk at night. The Cloud 5 also comes in a waterproof version, which I don\u2019t recommend. It\u2019s wrapped in an anhydrous membrane that seals out liquid but makes the shoe fit more tightly than the regular version (the company advises going up a half-size). Still, I found that even the regular Cloud 5 has a slim fit. On my insole test, my foot extended over the sides by about 0.5 inch, which wasn\u2019t enough to cause discomfort (since I have medium to narrow feet) but could be an issue for those with wider feet. Another potential downside to these shoes is the speed-lacing system. These On shoes come pre-laced with a thin cord that\u2019s knotted at both ends\u2014the idea is that you slide your feet into the shoe and pull the cord to secure your foot. I found the cord loosened up over time. The design feature is not for everyone, and On includes a set of traditional laces with every pair for this reason. The On Cloud 5 shoes transition from athletic wear to stylish, everyday outfits. Kari Molvar For Forbes Vetted From a fashion angle, the Cloud 5 checked the box for me. The Swiss shoe is sleek and minimal, and when paired with a skirt, the shoes looked like an intentional choice, not something I resorted to for comfort\u2019s sake. Best Cushioned Walking Shoes For Women Excellent Padding And Support, Minus Any Extra Weight Hoka Hoka Clifton 9 Weight: 7.3 ounces | Lacing system: Traditional | Heel drop: 5 mm | Size range: 5 to 12; regular, wide | Colors: 28 total, including Vanilla/Astral and Sandstone/Cream Best for: A plush, cushioned walking experience with a rocker-sole Those who have wide feet and like a roomy shoe Standing all day on your feet Skip if: You want a shoe with a leaner build and less heel height You have narrow feet I\u2019ll be honest: I wasn\u2019t wasn\u2019t fully sold on Hoka\u2019s wildly popular rocker-style heel at first, which gently glides your foot forward with a rolling motion that can help reduce foot strain. But, after wearing the Cliftons for a while, I found them extremely comfortable and surprisingly lightweight, despite the extra cushioning and padding in the heel. I have a relatively narrow foot, and I\u2019d say that this pair definitely felt roomy, even in the regular-width size. Given that your feet swell and expand when walking, the spacious design can be a good thing, especially if you have wide feet. Hoka has built an entire franchise around the Clifton, releasing new versions of this best-selling sneaker. This latest iteration features a lighter design\u2014it weighs 4 grams less than the previous model\u2014which Hoka accomplished by removing the overlays and hotmelts (or adhesives that bond together certain parts of a shoe). It also increased the cushioning, with a higher, 3mm heel stack that nicely supports your foot. The Cliftons are not a subtle sneaker that blends in with the rest of your look. But overtly \u201cloud\u201d sneakers are the norm now, which is a trend that Hoka helped ignite, so these shoes don\u2019t feel as out-of-the-box as they might have few years ago. Also, if you have a prefer a leaner-built shoe, you might find the ultra-padded style a bit cumbersome. Yet, I found that the rocking motion does help alleviate foot pain, so you might put up with a little extra bulk for the additional comfort. Best Supportive Walking Shoes For Women Excellent Traction, Cushioning And Stability Sorel Sorel Kinetic Impact II Weight: 10 ounces | Lacing system: Traditional |Heel drop: 10 mm | Size range: 5 to 12 | Colors: 21 total, including Black/White and Teal Chloride/Sea Salt Best for: Excellent traction and grip, with its scalloped sole Good underfoot cushioning Stylish, modern design Skip if: You want a flat outsole You like a traditional-looking sneaker with a subtler design The Sorel Kinetic Impact II is a great sneaker for both everyday wear and more rigorous activities. It has a comfortable fit, and its design is excellent for stability and traction. The outsole features the brand\u2019s signature \u201cscalloped\u201d edge, which I found especially helpful for providing extra grip on slippery or uneven surfaces while also alleviating pressure from the tender under-points of my foot. If you stand on your feet a lot during the day, the Kinetic Impact II is worth considering. In terms of its performance, the shoe has a cushioned midsole and a flexible, mesh upper that\u2019s breathable for all-day wear. I tested the Kinetic shoes during hot weather and my feet never got sweaty, thanks to the ventilation built into the airy upper. Style-wise, the Kinetic is a bold-looking shoe. If you plan to wear your sneakers to the office and work in a very traditional setting, this pair might turn some heads (which might actually be a good thing, depending on your take). On the downside, the Kinetic is not as light as the others I tested but that extra weight gives you added stability. The lacing system might not be everyone\u2019s taste since they run down the side of the shoe, as well as the top. But I found that extra coverage helped the shoe fit snugly to my foot, which provided additional stability. Best Affordable Walking Shoe For Women Breathable, Padded And Well Priced Under Armour Under Armour UA Essential Sportstyle Weight: 7.26 ounces | Lacing system: Traditional | Heel drop: 7.3 mm | Size range: 5 to 12 | Colors: 24 total, including Black and Baja Blue Best for: Those who stand or walk more casually than for serious exercise If you have wide feet, bunions or prefer a roomy fit Those who want an affordable walking shoe that doesn\u2019t skimp on comfort Skip if: You need a very stable shoe for more active days You prefer a grippy shoe for slippery surfaces These ultra-comfy shoes are a great value for casual, everyday walking because they are roomy, supportive and breathable. While they retail on the brand\u2019s site for $65, Under Armour often puts this highly popular sneaker on sale; I saw it go as low as $45 during testing. That\u2019s far less than $110, the average MSRP (manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price) of athletic sneakers in 2021, according to the most recent data from RunRepeat. Compared to the other shoes I tested, the the Sportstyle cost about $100 less. For the great price, you get plenty of features, too. Comfort is continually called out in the reviews, and the Sportstyle lived up to the hype in my tests. The padded heel makes for a well-cushioned ride, with a 7.3mm heel drop and 4.75cm heel stack (or height), which is ideal for walkers who land heel first or have Achilles tendon issues. That extra support tips the scales a tiny bit; this shoe has a weight of 7.26 ounces, placing it in the mid-range for our testing data. Still, this shoe wasn\u2019t noticeably clunky\u2014mostly because the mesh upper and soft sock liner make the shoe feel airy and weightless. The Sportstyle was also the best walking shoe for wide feet in my tests. The width of the insole was the widest among all those I wore, preventing any lateral rubbing on the sides of my foot. If you have bunions or stand for long periods\u2014such as when traveling and sightseeing, or in my case, watching a soccer game that goes into overtime\u2014the Sportstyle shoes are my pick. The spacious girth and wide toe box of these sneakers lets your feet comfortably expand and your toes splay out, with breathing room. The UA Essential Sportstyle shoes had the widest insoles of any shoes I tested, making them a great ... [+] pick if you have wide feet or prefer a roomier fit. Kari Molvar For Forbes Vetted This pick is less structured than a traditional walking shoe; on my pinch test, the heel counter scored a flexible (not firm) rating. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for serious walking on uneven, gravely terrain since your foot might move around in it slightly. The outsole is smooth without a ton of extra grip\u2014again, you wouldn\u2019t wear these on an intense walking expedition\u2014but in my tests, the shoes handled well on paved streets and all indoor surfaces. Overall, the Sportstyle is a solid choice for a lifestyle walking shoe that cradles your feet, pain-free, all day. For less than $70, you can\u2019t beat the value of this pair. Best Walking Shoes For Women With Arch Support Breathable Foam Midsole That Relieves Pressure Zappos New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v13 Weight: 6.9 ounces | Lacing system: Speed laces with knotted cord; traditional laces included as well | Heel drop: 10mm | Size range: 5 to 13; standard, wide | Colors: 20 total, including Black/White and Sea Salt/Grey Violet Best for: Those who want arch support or have fallen arches or flat feet A responsive ride that delivers a bounce in your step Stability on uneven surfaces Skip if: You want a shoe that sits lower to the ground I felt a noticeable spring in my step the first time I wore the New Balance Fresh Foam sneakers, which, as the name implies, are engineered with a contoured foam midsole that truly propels your foot forward as you move through your gait. Similar to other sneakers, the Fresh Foam are part of a best-selling collection that\u2019s continually updated and revamped each year. The 880v13 model is made with a 3% bio-based foam, derived from renewal resources, which is helpful for reducing the impact on the environment, especially since sneakers are an item that you have to frequently replace once they have worn out. If you have arch issues, or flat feet, the 880v13 is padded to deliver support in that area, with a 10mm heel drop that alleviates pressure so your foot is on an include, and not resting in a flat position all day. The uppers are made from a breathable mesh, which ensures your feet don\u2019t overheat in these sneakers. I found them airy, lightweight and very responsive during my longest walks. The only negative is that collar, or opening of the shoe where your foot slides in, comes up quite high on the foot, which can cause some rubbing on me. However, wearing 880v13 with regular low ankle socks (as opposed to no-show socks) helped solve that problem.

Here\u2019s a selection of top-rated sneakers worth checking out if you\u2019re looking for more options. Brooks Brooks Ghost 16 Since trying out the Ghost 14 and 15 a few years ago, I've become a huge fan of this shoe since it's so lightweight yet highly stable and responsive. The Ghost 16 is the latest version, just released this year. So far, it's been very spring-y and light to wear when walking and on my runs but I have noticed that the shoe is considerably wider than the previous iterations of the Ghost. While it feels a bit bulky on my feet, it's extremely comfortable and cushioned. It's too soon to tell if I like this pair more than the Ghost 15, but so far I'm enjoying the plush ride. Kizik: Unique Spring-Back Heel Design Kizik Kizik Athens I\u2019ve been curious about Kizik\u2019s \u201ccage heel\u201d design that allows you to slip your foot into the shoe without needing to bend down to tie the laces or wiggle your foot into place. The rest of the shoe is built out with a spring-y foam outsole to give you a lift and a breathable mesh upper that optimizes air flow and prevents sweat. We tested out the men\u2019s version of this sneaker for our Best Walking Shoes For Men guide and it scored high on comfort and durability. Nike: Highest Level Of Cushioning Nike.com Nike Invincible 3 I wore Nike running shoes for years before switching to Brooks. But this latest version of the popular Invincible has me itching to get back into Nike\u2019s. It\u2019s outfitted with the highest level of cushioning in the brand\u2019s lineup and a lot of padded comfort, which makes this pick versatile for power walking and higher impact activities. Allbirds: Durable, Water-Resistant Finish Allbirds Allbirds Trail Runners SWT Many times I\u2019ve been caught out in the rain while walking. Allbirds\u2019 Trail Runners SWT are a water-resistant version of a classic hiking and trail running shoe, with a grippy outsole and stabilizing support to keep your foot secure on slippery surfaces. Like other Allbirds sneakers, this one is made with sustainable materials, including eucalyptus tree fibers and a sugarcane-based EVA midsole. How I Tested The Best Walking Shoes For Women The best walking shoes need to handle different surfaces and withstand miles of use. They should also easily transition from workouts to everyday life, so I considered the overall design and aesthetics as well. With all these details in mind, I established specific testing criteria to determine which pairs will serve you best. Comfort: I tested how the shoes felt on my feet and whether or not they created soreness on pressure points or rubbed against any areas of my feet and ankles that would cause pain or blisters. I also considered if the shoes needed an extensive break-in period or were comfortable right out of the box. Lastly, I considered the lacing system and whether shoes were easy to put on and take off. Cushioning: Cushioning (the amount of padding in a shoe) contributes to comfort. I measured the thickness of the material under the midsole of the shoe in centimeters and squeeze-tested the firmness of the midsole on a scale from minimal, moderate to maximum by pressing down with my fingers. Arch support: Depending on your foot shape, you may need different levels of arch support to prevent pain while walking. I removed the insole in each shoe and looked for cushioned padding or contoured arcs around the midfoot, which provide extra support. (If you need to customize your fit, consult your doctor to see if orthotics or additional inserts may work for you). Traction: I also wore each shoe on a variety of roads, trails and rolling fields, during wet and dry weather, to test whether or not the shoe provided good traction in all scenarios. I compared the soles of each shoe as well to evaluate texture and grip. To test for traction, I walked on smooth surfaces like roads as well as uneven trails in both dry ... [+] and wet weather. Kari Molvar For Forbes Vetted Stability: Your feet should fit securely in your walking shoes\u2014they shouldn\u2019t have too much give, and you shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to lose your balance in them. I pinched the heel counter (the back of the shoe that wraps around the heel) to test for firmness, and rated it on a scale from low, moderate to high. Additionally, I placed the shoe on a flat surface and pushed down at the toe to see if the shoe rocked forward smoothly with an easy toe-off\u2014the point at which your foot rises from the floor during your gait (an effortless toe-off prevents tripping). Width and weight: Some people might prefer a lighter shoe to feel more nimble, or a wider shoe for more wiggle room. I weighed each shoe in ounces on a digital food scale and cross-referenced this measurement against how heavy or light the shoe physically felt on my foot while taking steps. I removed the insoles and placed my bare foot over it to check if my foot extended over at the sides, to access the overall width of the shoe. Heel drop: I measured the heel-to-toe drop for each shoe: This is the difference in millimeters of the amount of cushioning beneath the heels versus the balls of the feet. A larger heel drop indicates a higher heel in relation to the toe, while a low or zero drop shoe is flat and most closely mimics walking barefoot. According to New York podiatrist Nelya Lobkova, DPM, the best walking sneakers fall in the sweet spot of 4 to 8mm, which places less stress on the Achilles tendon. I measured the heel-to-toe drop for each shoe. A higher heel will be best for preventing heel ... [+] soreness. Kari Molvar For Forbes Vetted I started testing walking shoes in the late spring and summer of 2022, where I live in Connecticut, about 40 miles outside of New York City. I wore the sneakers for at least two hours a day on various surfaces to see how they performed. I walked on flat and steeply inclined paved and unpaved streets, hardwood floors and flights of stairs in my house and through wet, grassy parks and fields. I also ran typical errands in supermarkets and shops, and kept up with my two children for sports, activities and outdoor trips. Throughout the testing period, temperatures ranged from 55 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit, so I was able to see how breathable these shoes were in different weather conditions. When selecting the winners, I also considered style. I wore the shoes with both workout and everyday street clothing and searched to see if the shoes came in different colors to suit diverse fashion tastes. While aesthetics should never trump fit and comfort, you should take them into consideration if you plan to wear your pair all day. How To Pick A Walking Shoe Finding the right walking shoes is personal. To help you chose among the best options on the market, here\u2019s what the experts recommend you keep in mind: Cushioning The amount of cushioning you choose is ultimately a matter of personal preference. Most walkers will prefer a shoe that\u2019s evenly cushioned, rather than one with an exaggerated heel, for all-day wear. An evenly cushioned sole also lessens the risk of tripping or catching your heel on the edge of a carpet. Sole The outsole (commonly just referred to as the sole) is the part of the shoe that touches the ground and dictates the shoe\u2019s stability, says Lobkova. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able to bend the sneaker in half easily or twist it easily when holding both ends,\u201d she says. Instead, \u201cthere needs to be adequate rigidity in the sole and cushioning in the midfoot to prevent impact on the heel and walking injuries like plantar fasciitis.\u201d Anne Holland Johnson, M.D., who is a foot and ankle surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, prefers a rocker-style sole. Hoka first embraced this type of sole and now other brands are following suit. However, rocker soles tend to be less stable, so look for a traditional flat sole if you need greater stability. Size And Fit Every brand\u2019s sizes are a little different. Use your normal shoes as a starting point, but be prepared to size up or down to find your ideal fit. Your feet expand when walking so it\u2019s best to try on your shoes in the late afternoon (when your feet have swelled from the day\u2019s use). Stretch and wiggle your toes in the shoes; they should extend out comfortably in the toe box, or the uppermost part of the shoe, but not have too much room in front. Try the classic shoe-fitter test: Aim for one-half to a full thumb\u2019s width of space between your toes and the front end of the toe box. Lastly, look for a snug fit around the heel counter\u2014the part that wraps around the back of the shoe. \u201cThis minimizes abnormal stretching of the plantar fascia and diminishes pain and inflammation in the heel and arch of the foot,\u201d says Dr. Lobkova. It also prevents your foot from sliding up and down as you strike the ground, which can cause blisters. Arch Support You can gauge the arch support of a shoe by analyzing the insole. \u201cMost sneakers have removable insoles that you can take out and examine,\u201d says Lobkova. \u201cArch support appears as a supportive bump or curve on the insole around the midfoot. It acts as a buttress for the arch of the foot.\u201d While the Brooks Ghost 15 has this feature, not all sneakers do, says Lobkova. In that case, \u201cyou can add your own custom or prefabricated insole or orthotics for extra support.\u201d My Expertise I\u2019ve been a runner for more than 30 years, and a focused walker since 2020. Over the years, I\u2019ve covered countless miles across multiple types of terrain, and I've had my share of injuries along the way. I\u2019ve had three different foot surgeries in the last five years and, as a result, I\u2019m extremely picky about the fit and performance of my sneakers. I typically walk or run every day as a form of exercise\u2014in weather that can be bitterly cold, precariously icy or swelteringly hot\u2014and also hike when I travel. In the last year, I logged about 520 active miles. As a lifestyle writer, I\u2019ve covered beauty and wellness for the New York Times, Vogue and the Wall Street Journal. For Forbes Vetted, I\u2019ve also extensively tested and written about the most comfortable flats and the most comfortable sandals for women. For this piece, I consulted Nelya Lobkova, DPM, a board-certified podiatrist and foot surgeon, who runs the private practice Step Up Footcare in New York City. Additionally, I interviewed Anne Holland Johnson, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan who specializes in sports-related injuries and is a team physician for the New York Liberty (WNBA) professional basketball team. Lastly, I spoke with Annabelle Lemes, a certified trainer in Connecticut who emphasizes strength training, flexibility and movement through a variety of sports, including aerobic walking. What Shoes Do Orthopedic Surgeons Recommend? Johnson, the orthopedic surgeon I interviewed for this story, recommends walking shoes with a rocker sole, like the Hoka Clifton 9. \u201cDepending on your foot type, a rocker bottom-type sole requires less flexing and bending through the ankle and foot as you walk and lets the shoe take a bit more of the force,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, Johnson notes that \u201csomeone with a flat foot or fallen arches will likely feel most comfortable in stability type sneakers, ones that incorporate an arch support directly within the insole.\u201d My top pick overall, the Brooks Ghost, fits this description. What Type Of Shoes Are Good For Walking And Standing All Day? Whether you\u2019re at work, on a walking tour or visiting an amusement park, there are plenty of scenarios in which you\u2019ll need to walk and stand for long periods of time. For these kinds of days, look for a shoe with ample underfoot cushioning and grip, like the Sorel Kinetic Impact II. I also recommend the lightweight, airy On Cloud 5, which earned the top spot on our list of the best shoes for standing all day. Which Walking Shoes Are Best For Foot Conditions? While most sneakers are versatile enough to work for different walking needs, there are certain pairs that are best for specific foot conditions. Here\u2019s a guide for what to consider when shopping; and when in doubt, consult your podiatrist. Plantar fasciitis: Look for walking shoes with excellent arch support, cushioned insoles and shock-absorbing midsoles. Models that offer heel cups or extra cushioning in the heel area can also help relieve pain and discomfort. Brands like New Balance and Hoka often have good options for plantar fasciitis. Flat feet: Opt for motion control or stability walking shoes with firm midsoles and good arch support. Brooks has good shoes for dealing with this condition. High arches: Go for walking shoes with plenty of cushioning and flexibility. Shoes with a neutral or cushioned design work well for high arches. Consider Hoka or Brooks for cushioned options. Bunions: Prioritize walking shoes with a wide and roomy toe box and soft, breathable materials that won't put pressure on bunions. When browsing shoes for bunions, look for sneakers that come in a wide fit, such as those from New Balance and Under Armour. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Send me a secure tip.

Fitness devotee Trisha Bautista-Escueta relies on them for yoga and pilates, leisurely walks, running errands and on flights. They\u2019re a \u201cgreat all-around legging and a nice intro to [the brand], especially if all the other style choices are overwhelming,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that they're soft and buttery and the waist sits at a flattering height.\u201d While the fabric is a bit more delicate than models like the Wunder Train, they\u2019ll last a long time if you avoid friction and keep them out of the dryer. Best Lululemon Leggings For Workouts Supportive And Comfortable lululemon Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight Bautista-Escueta\u2014who does CrossFit (which includes both heavy lifting and high-intensity training) five or six days a week\u2014swears by the Wunder Train leggings as the best she\u2019s ever tried. \u201cThey\u2019re supportive and firm but still very breathable,\u201d she says. \u201cThe waist bands are thick enough that they hold everything in but not so high that you feel like you\u2019re in shapewear.\u201d And no matter how sweaty your workout gets, the material wicks away moisture and dries quickly. Best Lululemon Casual Pants Stylish For Travel And More lululemon Lululemon Softstreme High-Rise Pant Extremely soft but still functional, these beloved pants launched recently and quickly became a bestseller for their versatility. \u201cIt has a sweatpant feel but doesn\u2019t look like a traditional sweatpant,\u201d says Sashia Pelaez, a climbing coach and outdoor athlete. \u201cIt\u2019s my go-to outfit for the airplane and errands.\u201d Plus, the fabrics drapes nicely to create a stylishly relaxed silhouette. Best Lululemon Shorts For Running Anti-Chafe And Comes In Multiple Lengths lululemon Lululemon Hotty Hot Low-Rise Lined Shorts These Tiktok-viral shorts come in low-rise and high-rise designs, as well as 2.5- and 4-inch inseams. Reviewers love them for running and working out because they stay in place and have a built-in liner so you can move in any direction without restriction. The mesh panels on the side also allow air to flow through. However, they run small so you may want to size up from your usual size in leggings for a roomier fit. Best Lululemon Sports Bra Just The Right Amount Of Support lululemon Lululemon Energy Longline Bra People who obsess over this longline bra often buy it in multiple colors. Bautista-Escueta loves the medium support version because it holds everything in place without being too constricting. And unlike many sports bras that are a struggle to pull over your shoulders, this one is easy to get on and off because it has multiple stretchy straps. Bautista-Escueta recommends going with the B to D cup version if you have a bigger cup size. Best Lululemon Tank Top For Working Out Or Going Out lululemon Luluelmon Align Tank Top \u201cI consider these the holy grail of tanks with built-in bras,\u201d says Bautista-Escueta, who has worn these during low-impact workouts, yoga and paired with regular clothes. \u201cThe wide v-neck and scoop-back cut is universally flattering and because it\u2019s not as skimpy as a cami-style, it works as a nice top you can wear on the weekend with jeans,\u201d she says. It comes in both classic neutrals and brighter pops of color. Best Lululemon Long Sleeve Shirt Moisture-Wicking And Breathable lululemon Lululemon Swiftly Tech Long-Sleeve Shirt 2.0 Pelaez has worn this shirt climbing, snowboarding and mountain biking, and loves it because \u201cit\u2019s the right thickness and breathability to layer or wear on its own,\u201d she says. It fits slim to the body but has elastane in the mix for decent stretch so you can move with ease. And like all Lululemon products, you can get it hemmed for free, which Pelaez did to achieve the proper fit for her short torso. Best Lululemon Hoodie High-Quality, Cozy And Lasts Forever lululemon Lululemon Scuba Oversized Half-Zip Hoodie Perfectly oversized with a slight cropped length, this half-zip hoodie is a bestseller because it blends fashion and function.

Best Lululemon Lightweight Jacket Sleek And Slim Fit For Workouts lululemon Lululemon Define Jacket If you\u2019re looking for something sleeker than your average jacket, this versatile, lightweight option is ideal for layering during cooler weather or wearing on its own on mild days. It has a slim fit and stretchy fabric that moves with you, and the thumbholes and long cuffs keep your hands warm. Some reviewers note that they have had theirs for more than 10 years, and it still looks good as new. It comes in two fabric options: Luon (shown above), which is ultra-resilient, and Nulu, which is softer and more delicate. Best Lululemon Jacket For Cold Weather Warmth Without The Bulk lululemon Lululemon Down for It All Jacket Most down jackets are very puffy, but this one is insulated with high-quality, 700-fill-power goose down for superior warmth without the bulk. The stretchy side panels slim down the silhouette and add mobility so you don\u2019t feel like a marshmallow, and the water-repellent exterior is tough enough to handle light rain and snow. Keep in mind, down is not super breathable, so this jacket is best for wearing around town, rather than heart-rate-raising workouts. Best Lululemon Accessory TikTok Famous And Worth The Hype lululemon Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag Perhaps the most well-worn belt bag of recent times, the Everywhere Belt Bag has become a staple for travelers and city-dwellers that need a convenient way to carry their essentials like a phone, keys and chapstick. You can wear it slung over the shoulder or around your waist, and it has a secure exterior pocket on the back to stash your passport or wallet. Best Lululemon Pants For Men Casual, Sporty And Ready For Anything lululemon Lululemon ABC Classic-Fit Trouser Warpstreme Lululemon\u2019s cult-favorite ABC Pants combine comfort and style. In the signature Warpstreme fabric, they\u2019re breathable, quick-drying and wrinkle-resistant, making them great for work, travel or everyday situations. This style comes in different fabric options and cuts (like classic, relaxed, and slim fits) so you customize it to your liking. This pair also earned the top spot in our review of the best travel pants for men. Best Lululemon Joggers For Men Great For Weekends Or Workouts lululemon Lululemon ABC Jogger Whether you spend your days working from home or want a pair of pants for relaxing after work, these joggers are incredibly comfortable. The sleek, tapered design gives them a modern, athletic look, and the breathable, quick-drying fabric even performs well enough to wear for a short gym session. And while other slim-fit joggers can be pretty tight around the thighs and hips, these offer plenty of room. Best Lululemon Shorts For Men Breathable For Any Activity lululemon Lululemon Pace Breaker Linerless Shorts Dr. Landon Uetz, physical therapist and pickleball instructor on TeachMe.To, wears these breezy shorts during pickleball lessons and PT home visits with clients. \u201cThey fit very true, are lightweight, and can be used in a fitness or more casual setting without hesitation,\u201d he says.

Best Lululemon Workout Shirt For Men Anti-Odor Fabric And Breathable Design lululemon Lululemon Metal Vent Tech Long-Sleeve Shirt If you\u2019re looking for a technical long-sleeve shirt, this one is ideal for running and training because of its breathable, odor-resistant fabric and design that accommodates a wide range of motion.

And he can vouch for the impressive durability, as he has worn his regularly for nearly five years. Why Trust Forbes Vetted At Forbes Vetted, we provide in-depth, unbiased product reviews to help our readers make informed purchasing decisions. The author of this story, Forbes Vetted contributor Hannah Singleton, frequently covers all things fitness and activewear, so she is well-versed in the technical specs and fabrics that help products perform well. Forbes Vetted deputy editor Kari Molvar, a seasoned fashion editor and longtime runner, provided insight for the product list and edited this story. How We Chose The Best Lululemon Things To Buy We began by researching Lululemon bestsellers and combing through product reviews and customer feedback. As we curated our list, we considered factors like comfort, durability, functionality and technical performance. We also consulted with fitness professionals and avid Lululemon users to get their insights and recommendations on products they swear by. What Is Lululemon Most Known For? Lululemon is most known for its high-quality technical activewear and athleisure, particularly its leggings. Over the past 25 years, the brand has developed a reputation for creating stylish, functional and durable athletic apparel for activities from yoga to running to cross-training. What Are The Most Popular Lululemon Leggings? Lululemon has many leggings but two truly stand out as the best, and are designed for different activities and purposes: The Align leggings are a fan-favorite for low-impact activities like yoga, pilates and lounging. They are incredibly comfortable, making them a popular choice for everyday wear, but lack the durability of Lululemon\u2019s more technical leggings. The Wunder Train, on the other hand, are ideal for high-intensity activities like cross-training, running and weightlifting. These leggings are made with a lightly compressive Everlux fabric, which is breathable, moisture-wicking and quick-drying. What Is Lululemon\u2019s Most Affordable Item? Lululemon is known for their high-end prices, but with these prices come long-lasting and durable products. (Some reviewer and avid users we spoke with have had their leggings and shirts for almost 10 years.) However, if you\u2019re on a budget, you can still find some affordable items at Lululemon. The Everywhere Belt Bag costs less than $50 while their accessories like headbands and socks often ring in under $30. When we sorted their products from low to high price, the Women\u2019s Luxtreme Training Headband was listed for $14 and the Invisiwear Mid-Rise Thong Underwear was $18. Check out my website.

The best memory foam mattress toppers, for example, add the signature hugged sensation and impressive pressure relief of the material to your bed with minimal risk. Our top pick overall, the Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper, offers a comfortable contouring feel while remaining breathable and supportive. The best memory foam mattress toppers can upgrade your sleep space without having to replace your ... [+] mattress. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailer Dr. Emily Cleveland of Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic in Virginia suggests a memory foam mattress topper as a way to \u201ctest how your body responds to memory foam before committing to an entire mattress.\u201d If you\u2019ve owned your mattress for five years or less and you\u2019re interested in changing the firmness level, adding support or upgrading its cooling ability, a memory foam mattress topper is a great way to go. We researched to find the best memory foam toppers for a variety of concerns and preferences, so you can upgrade your bed for better sleep. Best Memory Foam Mattress Topper Overall: Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Affordable Memory Foam Mattress Topper: Linenspa Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Cooling Memory Foam Mattress Topper: Allswell Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Firm Memory Foam Mattress Topper: Viscosoft Select High-Density Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Memory Foam Mattress Topper For Side Sleepers: Puffy Deluxe Soft Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Memory Foam Topper For Back Pain: GhostBed Memory Foam Topper (Queen) Best Zoned Memory Foam Mattress Topper: Molecule Copperwell Topper (Queen) Best Hybrid Memory Foam Mattress Topper: The Coop Retreat Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Memory Foam Mattress On Amazon: Sleep Innovations Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Best Memory Foam Mattress Topper Overall Body-Contouring Comfort Meets The Cooling Effects Of Graphite MOST POPULAR Saatva Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Graphite-infused memory foam | Height: 3 inches | Cover: Yes | Warranty: 1 year | Trial: 180 nights Pros: Hugs the body closely without retaining heat Organic cotton cover is breathable and moisture wicking Cons: Cover is spot clean only Limited warranty Saatva produces some of the best mattresses we\u2019ve ever tried, and its mattress toppers are an excellent way to bring the brand\u2019s signature luxury comfort home at a lower cost. The Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Topper is a standout among its line and our pick as the best memory foam mattress topper for most people. It has 3 inches of body-contouring pressure relief, but minus the stifling feel that often accompanies memory foam. An infusion of cooling graphite gel plus an organic cotton cover draw away body heat, making it a suitable option for habitually hot sleepers. Although we'd prefer a machine-washable cover (it's spot-clean only) and a warranty longer than one year, the 180-night at-home trial gives you plenty of time to get acquainted with it. What our writers say: Co-author of this story and Forbes Vetted contributor Alison Barretta writes, \u201cI slept on a Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper during a particularly bad flare-up of my back pain and felt immediate relief after nights of enduring my too-firm mattress. I also tend to sleep warm, but this topper kept me cool at night. While it was comfortable for me as a dominant side sleeper, I found it best for back sleeping as it did an incredible job of distributing my weight in that position. If you have a taller mattress or are only looking for a slight comfort boost, I recommend the 1.5-inch Saatva High-Density Foam Topper, which I\u2019ve also tried. It has a more subtle contouring effect and sleeps relatively cool, but I\u2019d steer chronic overheaters towards the graphite-infused model.\u201d Best Affordable Memory Foam Mattress Topper This Budget-Friendly Topper Is A Hit With Amazon Shoppers Amazon Linenspa Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Gel-infused memory foam | Height: 2 to 3 inches | Cover: Optional | Warranty: 3 years | Trial: 30 nights Pros: Highly rated Options for thickness, sizes and cover Cons: Some reviewers find it sleeps warm A quality memory foam mattress topper doesn't have to deliver a substantial blow to your wallet\u2014like this model from Linenspa, a consistent Amazon bestseller with more than 87,000 5-star reviews. It\u2019s available with or without a machine-washable cover in a 2- or 3-inch profile. (Opt for the 3-inch version if you crave more sink-in softness.) Linenspa has a broader range of sizes than most of its competitors, so you can enhance a non-traditional size bed or make your RV mattress more inviting. However, despite the inclusion of cooling gel, some customers says this topper sleeps warm, but this could be offset with the right kind of breathable bedding. That drawback aside, this Linenspa mattress topper is a great choice if you want to upgrade your bed on a budget. What the reviews say: Hundreds of shoppers say this Linenspa memory foam topper is \u201cworth the money.\u201d According to one customer, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to spend the money for a whole new mattress so I\u2019m happy I got this mattress topper. My back pain already feels better and it\u2019s honestly so hard to get out of bed because of how comfortable it is.\u201d Another reviewer adds, \u201cMy son used this on top of his dorm bed. He said he slept so well on this topper and honestly liked it better than his bed at home.\u201d Best Cooling Memory Foam Mattress Topper This Well-Rated Graphite-Infused Topper Costs Less Than $150 Allswell Allswell Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Graphite-infused foam | Height: 3 inches | Cover: No | Warranty: N/A | Trial: 90 nights Pros: Graphite infusion helps minimize heat retention Choice of thickness Cons: Limited sizes available Allswell, a Walmart brand, has made a name for itself by offering affordable mattresses that don\u2019t skimp on quality. For chronic overheaters, its 2- or 3-inch memory foam mattress topper can help cool things down. A layer of graphite-infused Coolflow foam is designed to disperse heat and wick away moisture while you sleep. Starting at just $48 for a twin (before sales), it's a low cost for a cooling topper, although the trade-off is a shorter trial period and no warranty. Still, it's a low-risk investment for anyone seeking relief from night sweats. If you have a little extra money to spend, the Allswell 4-Inch Copper-Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper has a thicker layer of support with a two-layer design with proprietary Coolflow foam plus open-cell memory foam. What the reviews say: At Allswell, many shoppers say they\u2019d recommend this mattress topper to a friend. According to one customer, \u201cI was hesitant to purchase a foam topper since we've tried it in the past and I was super hot. This one wasn't bad at all...My wife [and I] no longer have a sore back in the morning and I'm not soaked in sweat.\u201d Another review says, \u201cI sleep hot and often wake up sweating, [but] since using this graphite-infused mattress topper I have been much cooler at night and sleeping better.\u201d Best Firm Memory Foam Mattress Topper An Easy, Affordable Way To Add Support To A Soft Mattress Viscosoft Viscosoft Select High-Density Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Gel-infused memory foam | Height: 3 or 4 inches | Cover: Yes | Warranty: 5 years | Trial: 90 nights Pros: Comes in a wide range of sizes, including less popular options like short queen and short king Pressure relieving and supportive Designed with anchor straps and slip-resistant mesh to keep it in place Cons: No options for firmness Sleeping on a mattress that's too soft can lead to aches and pains in the morning. If your bed has lost its firmness over time, or if your new mattress has more give than you anticipated, adding this medium-firm Viscosoft memory foam mattress topper is an easy comfort upgrade. Available in a 3- or 4-inch profile with a 3.5 pound density, this topper is designed to alleviate pressure on your back and joints while keeping your spine properly aligned. The foam is perforated and infused with gel to promote a cooler night\u2019s sleep. The included bamboo rayon cover is machine washable and has anchor straps for stability and a mesh backing for extra ventilation. A good value, the Viscosoft mattress topper sits comfortably in the mid-range price category and is often on sale. What the reviews say: One Viscosoft customer calls it, \u201cfirm yet soft,\u201d adding that they have \u201cno more hip pain...and turning from side to side or back to side is easy because of the firmness.\u201d Another shopper says, \u201cThe thickness is just right: firmness to support our back, yet gentle enough to allow us to sleep on our tummy or side just as comfortably. I recommend this topper and will buy it again for our guest room.\u201d Best Memory Foam Mattress Topper For Side Sleepers A Soft Memory Foam Topper With A Lifetime Guarantee Puffy Mattress Puffy Deluxe Soft Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Memory foam | Height: 2.5 inches | Cover: Yes | Warranty: Lifetime | Trial: 101 nights Pros: Secure fit thanks to deep elasticized sides and anti-slip base Also available in a firmer feel Impressive lifetime warranty Cons: 2.5 inches may not be thick enough for some sleepers Firm mattresses provide excellent support, but if they're too unyielding they can exert pressure on your joints, resulting in discomfort or pain while side sleeping. If that sounds like your current sleep scenario, consider this soft 2.5-inch memory foam mattress topper from Puffy that offers pressure relief along your hip and shoulder while on your side. It\u2019s wrapped in a lightweight, machine-washable cover made from a blend of bamboo rayon and polyester. The elastic pockets stretch to accommodate mattresses up to 15 inches deep, and a thin layer of gripping material on the bottom of the pad helps prevent shifting if you toss and turn. This mid-priced mattress topper comes with a 101-night at-home trial and a lifetime warranty\u2014the latter of which we typically see included with full-fledged mattresses. A firm version of the Puffy Deluxe Mattress Topper is also available to add support to a softer mattress. What the reviews say: \u201cIt is amazing how supportive this extremely soft 2.5-inch topper is,\u201d says a 175-pound side sleeper. \u201cI was able to sleep on my right side for the first time in a long time. Just enough softness to relieve the pressure points before the support is introduced.\u201d Another customer writes, \u201cThis is a great option for anyone looking to soften up a mattress that\u2019s too firm. Some toppers are too soft, but this one felt great for my back.\u201d Best Memory Foam Topper For Back Pain Strategically Zoned For Targeted Support GhostBed GhostBed Memory Foam Topper (Queen) Material: Gel-infused memory foam | Height: 3 inches | Cover: Yes | Warranty: 5 years | Trial: N/A Pros: Cooling and contouring to maximize comfort Zoned for more support in high-compression areas Cons: No options for height or firmness No trial window offered This gel-infused memory foam topper is strategically designed to accommodate the body\u2019s natural weight distribution for advanced pressure relief. Peaks and valleys in the foam offer greater support in areas of deeper compression for better spinal alignment, which can help relieve aches and pains. Plus, the varying heights encourage airflow for improved breathability. The 3-inch memory foam topper from GhostBed also comes with a water-resistant fitted cover (removable and washable) and a 2-inch GhostGrip elastic band for a secure fit. GhostBed considers mattress toppers a personal use item, so this one isn\u2019t eligible for a return. There\u2019s no sleep trial, either, but the topper does have a reasonable warranty. What the reviews say: \u201cI have hip bursitis and my husband has back problems,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cSleeping is sometimes not so comfortable for either of us. This topper is such a help in alleviating that discomfort for both of us.\u201d Another says, \u201cThe memory foam topper is outstanding. Immediately the first night it felt great. [It\u2019s] very comfortable sleeping in any position. [There\u2019s] no longer any back pain.\u201d Best Zoned Memory Foam Mattress Topper Seven Ergonomic Zones Provide Targeted Relief And Support Molecule Molecule Copperwell Topper (Queen) Material: Copper-infused memory foam \ufeff\ufeff| Height: 3 inches | Cover: No | Warranty: 5 years | Trial: 30 nights Pros: Zoned support works well for areas with deeper compression Cooling copper gel also adds antimicrobial properties Cons: Limited trial window A cover isn\u2019t included A zoned sleep surface can deliver better full-body comfort thanks to different levels of support for different areas of the body. Endorsed by Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, the Molecule Copperwell is a 3-inch memory foam topper with seven ergonomic zones\u2014three relief areas along the shoulders, hips and knees plus four support areas for the head, waist, legs and feet. An open-cell construction makes for a pliable, breathable surface that contours to your body without overheating. According to the manufacturer, an injection of copper gel adds temperature regulation and antimicrobial properties for a cooler, more sanitary sleep. By design, Molecule doesn\u2019t include a cover so sleepers can experience the full effects of its ergonomic foam. Still, we strongly suggest investing in a mattress protector to safeguard it from stains and spills. Try it risk-free for 30 nights. If you decide to keep it, a 5-year warranty applies. What the reviews say: Feedback is sparse yet overwhelmingly positive for the Molecule Copperwell. One customer says, \u201cThis mattress topper helped to relieve severe hip, back and shoulder pain overnight. [It\u2019s] surprisingly comfortable and cooling. [I\u2019m] very pleased with this purchase.\u201d Another reviewer adds, \u201cI have owned this topper for two weeks and have slept without back pain. It is super comfortable and has alleviated all pain for me.\u201d Best Hybrid Memory Foam Mattress Topper A Plush Topper Stuffed With A Memory Foam-Microfiber Fill Coop Sleep Goods The Coop Retreat Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Cross-cut foam and microfiber | Height: 5 inches | Cover: Yes | Warranty: 5 years | Trial: 100 nights Pros: Lofty and luxurious at 5 inches tall Cross-cut fill boosts breathability Baffle box construction keeps fill evenly distributed Cons: Sizes are limited The cover isn\u2019t removable and the topper is spot clean only If you desire the comfort of a featherbed but require the support of memory foam, the Coop Retreat Mattress Topper is the best of both worlds. Unlike typical foam toppers that consist of a single slab of material, this one is stuffed with a hybrid blend of cross-cut memory foam and microfiber\u2014the same fill used in Coop's popular adjustable pillow. The topper is a lofty 5 inches tall, yielding a lusciously plush feel akin to a luxury hotel bed. It\u2019s encased in a brushed microfiber cover (non-removable) and equipped with corner straps to keep it in place. While sizes are somewhat limited\u2014there's no twin or full option\u2014we like that it comes with a 5-year warranty and a 100-night trial. What the reviews say: One customer says, \u201cI can honestly say it makes a huge difference to my sleep and overall shoulder pain. My shoulder impingement and \u2018stuck traps\u2019 seem to have disappeared.\u201d Per another review, \u201cAfter experiencing the amazing Coop pillows, splurging for this topper was a no-brainer\u2014and it did not disappoint. [I] love the straps on all four corners to keep it secure, the individual pillowy boxes of incredible fluff and the weighty feel. This took our new bed from super comfortable to divine fluffiness.\u201d Best Memory Foam Mattress On Amazon Cooling, Plush Or Enhanced Support\u2014It's Your Choice Amazon Sleep Innovations Memory Foam Mattress Topper (Queen) Material: Gel-infused memory foam, fiberfill | Height: 4 inches | Cover: Yes | Warranty: 10 years | Trial: 30 days Pros: Options for plush, cooling or enhanced support Quilted cover is removable and machine washable Cons: Return window is limited This highly rated topper combines a quilted, fiberfill-stuffed cover with gel-infused memory foam in varying ratios to deliver plush, cooling or enhanced support. That makes it a great pick for a wide variety of sleepers looking to address a range of issues, including pressure relief, overheating or a certain mattress feel. The cover, which is designed like a fitted sheet, keeps the gel foam layer securely in place and it can be removed and machine washed for easy cleaning. This Amazon pick is also made with CertiPUR-US-certified foam and comes in most standard mattress sizes. What the reviews say: \u201cI had no idea how much my body was suffering until I got this mattress topper,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cI am sleeping better than I\u2019ve slept in years through the night with minimal tossing and turning in very much decreased pain. It is not too soft. It is not firm. It is absolutely perfection.\u201d MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The Best Things To Buy From Lululemon In 2024, According To Our Review By Hannah Singleton Contributor The Best Walking Shoes For Women, According To Extensive Testing By Kari Molvar Forbes Staff Why Trust Forbes Vetted At Forbes Vetted, we acknowledge the role a good night\u2019s sleep plays in our overall health and the importance of being a discerning consumer. Our quickly expanding library of mattress and bedding stories features detailed product reviews, discussions with trustworthy medical experts and recent developments on ways you can hack your sleep. The author of this article, Alison Barretta, is a Forbes Vetted contributor who\u2019s been professionally reviewing mattresses for three years. She also deals with back pain, which she says is a blessing and a curse, given her profession. Forbes Vetted has several experienced mattress and bedding testers on staff, including senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman and mattress and sleep editor McKenzie Dillon, both of whom oversaw this article. For additional expert insight, we also consulted with Dr. Emily Cleveland of Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic in Virginia, Dr. Matthew Cavanaugh of Cavanaugh Chiropractic in Louisiana and Dr. Grant Radermacher of Ascent Chiropractic in Wisconsin. Forbes Vetted contributor Jessica Timmons, who has been writing sleep content for well over a decade, updated this piece in May 2024 and added the GhostBed Memory Foam Topper and the Sleep Innovations Memory Foam Mattress Topper from Amazon to the list. How We Chose The Best Memory Foam Mattress Toppers Brand reputation and customer reviews largely influenced our picks for the best memory foam mattress toppers, as did firsthand experience where applicable. Alison Barretta, author of this article, has slept on the Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper. Although she hasn\u2019t tried the Viscosoft, Allswell or Coop toppers featured on the list, her positive experiences with those brands\u2019 other offerings helped inform her choices. We also honed in on memory foam mattress toppers with outstanding features such as ergonomic designs, cooling fibers and removable covers that are easy to wash. We prioritize products that have a warranty and/or a trial period to ease consumers\u2019 minds, especially when buying online. The majority of our picks fall within the mid-range price bracket, but we\u2019ve also included reliable budget-friendly models along with more luxurious offerings so you can find what you need, regardless of budget. What To Consider When Shopping For A Memory Foam Mattress Topper Aside from price\u2014which is understandably important\u2014there are several other factors to consider when purchasing the right memory foam mattress topper for your needs. Thickness Mattress toppers add some height to your bed, so you want to take this into account as you shop and consider fitted sheets and bedding. Memory foam mattress toppers are typically 2 to 4 inches thick, with a handful of options falling outside of that range. Thinner bed toppers are usually more affordable and may be better for you if your mattress is already quite tall. For more cushion and support, seek something thicker. Firmness Just like their full-sized counterparts, memory foam toppers are either soft or firm. \u201cFirmness level is an important feature to consider if you have specific needs such as back or joint pain,\u201d says Cavanaugh. The right topper can help correct the firmness of your current mattress\u2014buying a plush topper is the right move for a mattress that\u2019s too hard, and vice versa. Temperature Regulation Cavanaugh says memory foam is notorious for trapping heat, making it less than ideal for hot sleepers. However, as our list shows, there are memory foam toppers engineered for temperature regulation. Look for foam that\u2019s ventilated and/or infused with cooling elements like gel, graphite or copper, which are known for their heat-conducting properties. If a cover is included, it should be made from a breathable fiber (like cotton) or phase changing materials that are cool to the touch. Also consider the type of bedding you use. Sheets and pillowcases made from materials like cotton, linen or bamboo\u2014as well as specialty cooling sheets designed to wick away heat and moisture\u2014may help mitigate night sweats when sleeping on memory foam. Foam Density Foam density is a characteristic that's often overlooked, but it determines how supportive and responsive your memory foam topper is. Mattress foam density ranges from 0.8 to 6 pounds per cubic foot. According to Radermacher, most people should look for a minimum foam density of at least 3 pounds per cubic foot. \u201cHigh-density foam won't be the cheapest option,\u201d says Radermacher, but he recommends making it one of your top priorities for optimal comfort. Alternative Materials Mattress toppers come in an array of materials beyond memory foam, and you may find that one made with latex foam, down or a hybrid construction is a better fit. Latex, for example, is a good choice if you\u2019re prone to sleeping hot or don\u2019t like sinking into your bed (provided you don\u2019t have a latex allergy, of course). Unlike memory foam, latex is a naturally breathable material with a more buoyant sensation that lets you feel as if you\u2019re floating on your bed. Its firmer support makes it a good choice for sleepers with back pain. However, latex is often more expensive than synthetic foam, especially if it\u2019s made with certified organic materials. A featherbed creates a softer, plush bed feel akin to what you\u2019d experience at many of the world\u2019s top hotels. It\u2019s a more economical choice compared to memory foam, but there\u2019s less of an emphasis on support so it\u2019s not recommended for sleepers with back or joint pain. Plus, natural down can trigger allergies for some people, although you can find options that trade feathers for synthetic down alternatives. Hybrid mattress toppers combine multiple layers of materials, including foams, latex or down. Some also include a thin layer of micro coils for targeted support. A mattress pad is ideal if you don\u2019t need to completely overhaul the feel of your sleep surface. It\u2019s typically filled with down, wool or a synthetic fiber and adds another 1 to 2 inches to your bed. Most mattress pads are machine washable for easy maintenance and usually cost less than a topper. But if breathing new life into an aging mattress is your goal, a mattress topper, memory foam or otherwise, has a more profound effect. What Is The Highest Rated Memory Foam Topper? It depends where you\u2019re looking, but both the Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Mattress Topper and the Linenspa Memory Foam Mattress Topper are highly rated. In fact, the Linenspa topper has close to 120,000 reviews, and the majority are 5 stars. Do Memory Foam Mattress Toppers Work? A quality memory foam mattress topper can add gentle contouring and pressure relief to your mattress, which can help improve comfort. But memory foam mattress toppers can\u2019t fix a sagging or worn-out bed. If your mattress is no longer offering the support you need, a topper is a short-term fix at best. How Do I Choose A Memory Foam Mattress Topper? Just like choosing a mattress, the best way to choose a memory foam mattress topper is to consider your personal needs and preferences. If you sleep hot, look for gel and graphite infusions that help minimize heat retention. If you want to add a firmer or plusher feel to your bed, find a topper with an appropriate comfort level (and don't forget that body weight plays a big role in how soft or firm a mattress or topper feels). It\u2019s also helpful to factor for your preferred sleep position, a thickness that doesn\u2019t add excessive height to your mattress and price.", "summary": "The best memory foam mattress toppers are an easy and affordable way to upgrade your bed.

Designed with convenience in mind, the best water filter pitchers reduce a broad range of contaminants, on top of being sleek, easy to refill and pour, and affordable. After testing 14 popular pitchers over the course of a month, the ZeroWater 10-Cup Ready-Pour Pitcher emerged as the clear winner. Certified to reduce lead, chlorine and substances known as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d the pitcher has an impressive filtration system and produces pure-tasting water. Some of the best water filter pitchers come from Aarke, ZeroWater and Hydros. Illustration: Forbes / Image: Retailers Here are all the winners from my testing process: Best Water Filter Pitcher Overall: ZeroWater 10-Cup Ready-Pour Pitcher Best Value Water Filter Pitcher: Brita Tahoe Water Pitcher Best Upgrade Water Filter Pitcher: Larq Pitcher Purevis Best-Designed Water Filter Pitcher: Aarke Purifier Best Slim Water Filter Pitcher: Pur Plus 7-Cup Pitcher Easiest-To-Pour Water Filter Pitcher: Hydros Glass Slim Pitcher If you don\u2019t have an under-sink water filter, faucet water filter or whole-house system, a pitcher offers the easiest way to improve the quality of your H2O\u2014which is important. \u201cThe vast majority of people in the United States likely have some kind of contaminant present in their drinking water that\u2019s above health guidelines, because what is legally allowed in tap water is not necessarily safe,\u201d says Sydney Evans, senior science analyst at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. To ensure you pick out the right pitcher for your household, consider which contaminants you\u2019re most interested in reducing, as no two filters are the same. It\u2019s also helpful to be familiar with NSF/ANSI Standards, which relate to the reduction of contaminants and particles in water. The most common standards for water filters are NSF/ANSI 42, 53 and 401, each of which pertain to different contaminants: heavy metals, chlorine, emerging contaminants like ibuprofen and more. Then, consider factors such as ease of use, capacity, filtration speed and value. Ahead, here are the best water filter pitchers to improve the taste and quality of your drinking water. Best Water Filter Pitcher Overall Fast And Effective Water Filtration With Great Taste Amazon ZeroWater 10-Cup Ready-Pour Pitcher NSF/ANSI standards: 42, 53 | Reservoir capacity: 10 cups | Filter life: 20 to 40 gallons | Filter replacement cost: $35 (pack of two) Best for: Effectively removing TDS and PFAS Fast filtration speed Clean, pure-tasting water Skip if: You want a pitcher with the longest-lasting filters You want a model that meets standard 401 After extensive testing, the ZeroWater 10-Cup Ready-Pour Pitcher emerged as my top pick, thanks to its quick and strong filtration system and the clean, crisp taste of its water. Featuring five-stage filtration, this pitcher meets the two most important NSF/ANSI standards: 42 and 53, which pertain to \u201caesthetic\u201d contaminants like chlorine, as well as lead, chromium and PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, nicknamed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d). In fact, in a recent study of 10 pitchers conducted by the Environmental Working Group, ZeroWater\u2019s filter was one of only three options that filtered out PFAS to non-detectable levels. The ZeroWater 10-Cup Ready-Pour Pitcher produced the cleanest-tasting water of all the models I ... [+] tested. Erica Puisis ZerowWater\u2019s biggest claim to fame, though, is that its filters can remove 99.6% of total dissolved solids (TDS), which covers salts, metals, cations and other minerals that can affect water\u2019s taste. When I used a water testing kit to analyze the quality of the pitcher\u2019s filtered water, the results were a string of zeros. The filter also comes with an electronic meter that you can use to take an instant reading of your water\u2019s TDS levels\u2014it\u2019s the best way to track the filter\u2019s life, as there\u2019s no other indicator built in to the pitcher itself. If the meter registers 006, it\u2019s time to swap the filter, per the brand. Aside from the pitcher\u2019s filtering ability, I also appreciated a few aspects of its design: Though it\u2019s not the most sophisticated option out there, it has a quick-fill spigot on the bottom of the reservoir that allows you to dispense ready-to-drink water as the pitcher is filtering, and all the pitcher\u2019s parts are easy to clean. Simply put, I believe you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a pitcher with a more impressive filter\u2014though the strong filtration system does have one shortcoming. If you have very hard water (as I do), the filter has a relatively short life span. While the brand estimates that each filter should last between 20 and 40 gallons, I had to replace mine after just over a dozen filter cycles. Therefore, if your tap water is high in TDS, keep in mind that you\u2019ll likely need to replace the filter more frequently. To ensure you\u2019re never without a replacement, I recommend setting up an auto-order of the filter multipacks. Best Value Water Filter Pitcher An Easy-To-Fill Option With A Useful Filter Life Indicator Target Brita Tahoe Water Pitcher NSF/ANSI standards: 42, 53, 401 | Reservoir capacity: 10 cups | Filter life: 120 gallons | Filter replacement cost: $20 Best for: Budget-friendly, long-lasting filters Simple cleaning and filling An LED filter-life indicator Skip if: You\u2019re short on space, since the design is bulky You want to more effectively reduce TDS As the longtime leading brand in the water filter space, Brita is a household name\u2014chances are, you\u2019ve enjoyed water from one. During testing, the Brita Tahoe Water Pitcher with Elite Filter proved to be easy to use and effective at filtering out contaminants. It also fills its large 10-cup reservoir in less than four minutes. The pitcher\u2019s design is relatively frills-free, though it\u2019s not the most basic of the brand\u2019s lineup. To help you monitor the filter life, the lid has an LED light that turns on whenever you pour from the filter: When the light turns red, you know it\u2019s time to replace the filter. Fortunately, filter changes are few and far between, especially if you opt for Brita\u2019s Elite filter series. These filters offer more advanced filtration capabilities and a longer life span\u2014they should last for 120 gallons, or about six months of average use. Though this pitcher isn\u2019t the cheapest option out there, it\u2019s nonetheless an incredible value, thanks to its generous capacity and the longevity of its filters. (When buying a pitcher, remember to factor in the cost of replacement filters.) My only gripe is that the filtered water at times had a slightly off taste. I sometimes picked up the taste and odor of chlorine, and when I evaluated the water quality using at-home test strips, the strips confirmed the filter had only a marginal impact on reducing TDS in my water supply. Even still, the filter meets the performance criteria for NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 401, giving you peace of mind that it\u2019s filtering out heavy metals and trace pharmaceuticals. Best Upgrade Water Filter Pitcher A Premium Pick With Smart Features MOST POPULAR Amazon Larq Pitcher Purevis NSF/ANSI standards: 42, 53, 401 | Reservoir capacity: 8 cups | Filter life: 60 gallons | Filter replacement cost: $25, Essential filter; $33, Advanced filter Best for: Preventing bacteria growth with a UV light Tracking your water consumption and filter life with an app Multiple filter options to suit your needs Cleaning in the dishwasher (except for the filter and PureVis Wand) Skip if: You don\u2019t have an iOS device to run the app You want a more budget-friendly pitcher The Larq Pitcher Purevis was the one of the most expensive water filter pitcher I tested\u2014and it was also one of the most impressive. To start, its construction is high-quality and sleek: Available in two colors, the plastic feels thick and durable, while the handle\u2019s rubbery grip provides extra security while pouring. It also has a touch-free fill opening that makes refilling a breeze, and during testing, it took a mere four minutes for the reservoir to fill with filtered water. Lastly, the pitcher\u2014which has two filter options\u2014ranked second for having the best-tasting water, just behind ZeroWater. The Larq pitcher's Purevis Wand uses UVC light to help kill bacteria. Erica Puisis The most unique feature of this pitcher, though, is the Purevis Wand, a rechargeable piece that attaches to the filter and emits a UVC light to eradicate bacteria that might otherwise grow in the moist environment of a water pitcher. While you can activate the light at any time with the press of the button or set it to begin every time you refill the pitcher, it also runs automatically every six hours. To keep tabs on the Wand\u2019s battery (a single charge should last about a month), download the companion app, where you can also track the filter\u2019s life and your household\u2019s water intake. (Unfortunately, there\u2019s no support for Android users at this time.) For those looking to invest in a high-end pitcher, you\u2019ll do no better than the Larq Pitcher Purevis. What\u2019s more, it comes with an Advanced filter, which combats a long list of contaminants covered by NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 401, including PFAS and emerging contaminants like trace pharmaceuticals. If you\u2019d rather opt for a more budget-friendly option, the Essential filter meets NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53. Both options have an estimated 60-gallon life span. Best-Designed Water Filter Pitcher An Elegant, Sustainability-Minded Glass Option Amazon Aarke Purifier NSF/ANSI standards: N/A; meets EU Standard EN 17093:2018 | Reservoir capacity: 10 cups | Filter life: 31.7 gallons | Filter replacement cost: $20 (pack of three), Pure Filter Granules; $30 (pack of three), Enriched Filter Granules Best for: People who prefer a pitcher made of glass and stainless steel Easy cleaning in the dishwasher Affordable filter refills Skip if: You prefer a pitcher that filters out PFAS Water filter pitchers aren\u2019t exactly known for their good looks, but not all are made from plastic. With a glass carafe and stainless steel components, this dishwasher-safe pitcher from Aarke is sleek and sophisticated. It\u2019s also sustainability-minded: Whereas most pitchers rely on single-use plastic filters, the Aarke purifies water using granules (made of ion exchange resin and activated carbon) that you pour into the stainless steel basket. During testing, I was impressed by this pitcher\u2019s fast filtration speed: It takes about three minutes to process 5 cups, which is the maximum amount you can filter at a time. (The carafe holds 10 cups of water in total.) Though this pitcher doesn\u2019t have NSF/ANSI certifications, both types of its Filter Granules\u2014Pure and Enriched\u2014meet the criteria for EU Standard EN 17093:2018, which addresses performance criteria for water filtration systems. The Pure Filter Granules reduce heavy metals and limescale while improving taste by reducing chlorine levels. The Enriched granules, meanwhile, can do everything the Pure granules can, plus remineralize the water with magnesium and increase the pH to make it more alkaline. Sold in packs of three, both types can filter about 32 gallons. Best Slim Water Filter Pitcher A Basic, Space-Saving Option Amazon Pur Plus 7-Cup Pitcher NSF/ANSI standards: 42, 53, 401 | Reservoir capacity: 7 cups | Filter life: 40 gallons | Filter replacement cost: $11 (Pur Plus) Best for: Small dimensions An LED filter-life indicator light Simple cleanup in the dishwasher Skip if: You want a faster filtering speed You need a reservoir with a larger capacity If your fridge is often short on space, the Pur Plus 7-Cup Pitcher\u2014which is less than 5 inches wide\u2014has a slim build that can fit in even the tightest of spaces. During testing, I was especially impressed by the pitcher\u2019s user-friendly design: It\u2019s easy to maintain a secure grip as you pour, thanks to the rubberized handle, and the thumb lever that opens the fill door on top of the pitcher makes refilling a breeze. Though it does take a while for the water to trickle into the reservoir (during testing, it took 16 minutes for 7 cups), the brand\u2019s Plus filters remove a greater percentage of heavy metals like copper and cadmium than the basic ones. In addition, the Plus filters trap microplastics and other compounds covered by NSF/ANSI standard 401. (Both filters have a 40-gallon life span and are compatible with this pitcher.) And when it comes time to wash the pitcher, the process is a breeze. The lid pops off for easy access to the interior components, and there aren\u2019t any crevices or tight corners that I found challenging to hand-wash. It\u2019s also dishwasher-safe, if you\u2019d rather save yourself the effort. Either way, make sure you snap off the LED filter indicator light from the underside of the lid before you wash the rest. Easiest-To-Pour Water Filter Pitcher A Carafe-Style Pitcher With An Ergonomic Design Amazon Hydros Glass Slim Pitcher NSF/ANSI standards: 42 | Reservoir capacity: 5 cups | Filter life: 40 gallons | Filter replacement cost: $11 (pack of two) Best for: Lightweight, ergonomic design Affordable filter replacement Filtering water as you fill the reservoir Skip if: You want a pitcher that complies with NSF/ANSI standards 53 or 401 You\u2019re looking for a filter-life indicator Let\u2019s be honest: Unless you have extremely strong wrists and forearms, even the most well-designed water pitchers are somewhat difficult to lift and pour. Some are much easier to grip, though, such as the Hydros Glass Slim Pitcher. Designed like a conventional water carafe with a narrow neck you can wrap your hand around, this lightweight model was a breeze to maneuver. During testing, I had zero issue controlling the flow of the water as I poured. Now, it\u2019s worth noting that its filtration system (which uses coconut-shell carbon) leaves something to be desired. While the filters last for 40 gallons and don\u2019t carry a high cost, they\u2019re only compliant with NSF/ANSI standard 42\u2014not 53 or 401. Therefore, if you\u2019re worried about heavy metals, PFAS or trace pharmaceuticals in your drinking water, this pitcher isn\u2019t the best option for your household. For those whose concerns are mainly related to taste and odor, though, this petite 5-cup pitcher has a lot going for it. On top of being easy to lift, it filters water at a rate of about 1 ounce per second, meaning you can refill the entire pitcher in less than one minute. During testing, I found myself keeping the Hydros pitcher on my desk for quick refills throughout the day. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED What To Wear On Vacation: Smart Outfit Ideas From Our Fashion Team By Katherine Louie Forbes Staff The Best Things To Buy From Lululemon In 2024, According To Our Review By Hannah Singleton Contributor Other Water Filter Pitchers I Tested Along with the six winning water filter pitchers, I also tested eight more models that didn\u2019t have the attributes or performance to land in the rankings. Brita Everyday Water Filter Pitcher: The most basic option in the Brita lineup, this water pitcher functions fine and meets the criteria for NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53. However, the plastic components feel cheap, and there\u2019s no filter-life indicator to easily recognize when it\u2019s time to change the filter. Based on my testing, you\u2019d be better off spending a few more dollars to buy the Brita Tahoe Water Pitcher. Brita Rapids Stream Water Pitcher: I was excited about the convenience of this filter-as-you-pour water pitcher, but it\u2019s practical only for the first glass or two. With less water volume in the pitcher, the stream from the filter slows dramatically, leading you to frequently refill the pitcher to maintain the flow rate. Pur 11-Cup Pitcher: A budget-friendly choice, this water filter pitcher is economical and compatible with Pur\u2019s standard filters or the more advanced Pur Plus filters. It functioned fine in most aspects of testing, but the water had a chlorinated taste, despite meeting the standards for NSF/ANSI standard 42, which addresses chlorine taste and odor. The pitcher\u2019s bulky, dated design doesn\u2019t do much to distinguish it from the competition, either. Aquagear Filter Pitcher: This 10-cup model is equipped with a filter that meets NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 401. It required a few more steps to prep the filter, including flushing the filter for two minutes using an included accessory piece. Although it did produce clean-tasting filtered water, I think there are better options at this price point. LifeStraw Home 7-Cup Glass Water Filter Pitcher: This glass water filter pitcher has a few things going for it, including an appealing aesthetic design and a filtration system that meets a long list of NSF/ANSI standards: 42, 53 and 401. Sadly, it took a long time for the filter to purify the water, making it impractical for everyday use. While LifeStraw acknowledges the filtration speed is slow initially, even after using it for a week, it still took the pitcher 45 minutes or more to fill the pitcher to its 7-cup capacity. Soma 10-Cup Pitcher: The bamboo handle is the most distinguishing feature of this water filter pitcher, which ultimately missed the mark. Notably, Soma\u2019s cone-shaped filtration system generated a lot of noise as the water dripped into the carafe, and it didn\u2019t yield especially great-tasting filtered water. That said, it\u2019s not a bad pitcher: It meets NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53. I just wish Soma offered a glass carafe version to elevate the overall design. Seychelle Gen 2 Dual pH2O Pure Water Pitcher: This option from Seychelle meets NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53, plus it claims to raise the pH of your water up to 9.5 to yield more alkaline drinking water. While this pitcher might be able to raise some tap water\u2019s pH by that much, it only increased my house\u2019s H2O from 6.0 to 7.0. Clearly Filtered Water Pitcher: To its credit, the filtration system of this water filter pitcher meets a long list of NSF/ANSI standards: 42, 53, 401 and P473. Several flaws in its design keep me from recommending it, though. For one, it requires the most advanced filter prep of any water pitcher I tested; for example, it requires the use of a \u201cpriming bag\u201d that preps the filter media for use. Second, the lid of the pitcher is prone to falling off, which happened to me twice. How I Tested The Best Water Filter Pitchers To determine the best water filter pitchers, I started by identifying the most popular, top-rated models on the market, considering each pitcher\u2019s design as well as the strength and life span of the filters. After eliminating a few models that didn\u2019t meet my criteria for quality, I narrowed down my list to 14 pitchers, which I put through a series of tests over the course of multiple weeks. The winning water filter pitchers from my testing process. Erica Puisis First, I set up each water pitcher following the instructions for prepping and inserting the filter. I noted which filters required presoaking, a purge under the faucet or the use of another accessory to prep the filter. In this phase of testing, I also washed each pitcher by hand, paying attention to how easy it is to reach every nook and cranny of the pitcher\u2019s reservoir, lid and other components. Although some water filter pitchers are dishwasher-safe, I still washed those models by hand in addition to putting them through the dishwasher. Next, I filled each pitcher\u2019s filter compartment and timed how long it took the water to flow into the reservoir. This test helped me identify the efficiency of the models, which is important to some households. Once the initial setup and filter-timing tests were complete, I used each water filter pitcher to fill my glass, top off my water bottle and fill my coffee maker\u2019s water reservoir. I routinely refilled the pitchers and rotated them in and out of the fridge, tasting the water at room temperature and chilled. Because taste is largely subjective, I conducted a blind tasting with three participants to help reduce bias. Since there\u2019s no standard size for water filter pitchers (I tested models with capacities ranging from 40 ounces to 80 ounces), I filtered at least 7 gallons of water through each pitcher over the course of testing. That\u2019s equivalent to how much water one person might filter in two weeks of use, assuming they\u2019re drinking an average of eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. With each refill, I was looking for signs of slowing filter speeds or changes in water taste or clarity. How To Pick A Water Filter Pitcher All water filter pitchers perform the same basic function: They purify tap water using a cartridge or filter media that traps contaminants, leaving you with cleaner drinking water. That said, not all filters can capture the same contaminants, so it\u2019s important to pay close attention to the NSF/ANSI standards that each filter meets. When shopping, you also want to consider a pitcher\u2019s design, ease of use and capacity, as well as the life and price of replacement filters. Contaminants Filtered While water filters for home use have come a long way since their advent, no single filter can address every contaminant out there. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that there is no such thing as a perfect filter that removes every single contaminant,\u201d says registered dietitian nutritionist Maya Feller. \u201cPeople should choose the filter that works for their home as well as budget, and one that filters out the particular contaminants that they want to remove.\u201d Some of the most common contaminants that filters remove are heavy metals like lead and copper, as chlorine. To know which contaminants a filter is capable of reducing or removing, check out which NSF/ANSI standards it\u2019s certified to meet. NSF/ANSI 42: This standard relates to the taste, odor and appearance of the water, otherwise known as \u201caesthetic claims,\u201d says water filtration expert Rick Andrew. The most common contaminants this standard includes are chlorine, chloramine (disinfectants used to treat tap water) and particulates. NSF/ANSI 53: This standard pertains to the reduction of health-related contaminants like heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively known as PFAS). \u201cPFAS constitute a group of synthetic chemicals extensively used in industrial and consumer products for several decades,\u201d says Evans. \u201cRenowned for their environmental persistence and resistance to degradation, these compounds, aptly nicknamed \u2018forever chemicals,\u2019 have been detected in water supplies globally, prompting concerns regarding potential health ramifications.\u201d NSF/ANSI 401: This standard governs the reduction of emerging and incidental contaminants, like bisphenol A (BPA) and ibuprofen. \u201cThese are contaminants that may be present in drinking water at very low concentrations, but consumers are interested in filtering them out anyway,\u201d explains Andrew. Keep in mind that these standards address a wide range of contaminants, and just because a water filtration system meets the requirements for a specific standard doesn\u2019t mean that it reduces every contaminant addressed by the standard. \u201cThe NSF standards require that a filtration system must meet the requirements to reduce at least one contaminant,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cThey may meet the requirements to reduce more than one contaminant, but only one contaminant reduction is required to conform to the standard.\u201d So if you\u2019re especially concerned about a specific contaminant, research any performance data sheets made available by the manufacturer to better assess the filter\u2019s ability to reduce it. An additional resource worth consulting is the NSF\u2019s Certified Products and Systems database, where you can check whether a filter is NSF-certified. \u201cCertification means that a filter has been third-party tested, meaning it has undergone rigorous testing to standard requirements to verify the product\u2019s claims in line with the standard,\" says Kyle Postmus, senior business manager for residential water filtration at NSF. Pitcher Design All water filter pitchers have a similar form factor: They have a top-fill function and a spout for pouring. Beyond that, the design can vary pretty significantly. Pitchers can be made of BPA-free plastic or glass, and the capacity can range from 40 to 80 ounces or more. Whether you opt for plastic or glass comes down to personal preference. With capacity, just keep in mind that the larger the pitcher, the more unwieldy it is to grasp. If you suffer from arm or wrist mobility or strength issues, it\u2019s probably best to get a pitcher that\u2019s on the smaller side. Filter Life Over time, filters lose their effectiveness as contaminants build up. Therefore, you need to replace the filter from time to time, the frequency of which depends on its life span. Most manufacturers provide an estimate on how many gallons of water each filter can process before replacement is recommended. Just know that the quality of your tap water is a factor. If you have poor-quality tap water and choose a filter that is very effective at removing a wide range of contaminants, for example, the filter life may be considerably shorter than what it would be with tap water that is considered to be of average or good quality. In any case, consider buying filters in multipacks, which are typically a better value than single filters. My Expertise I\u2019m a product reviewer and writer with six years\u2019 experience, and I specialize in researching and testing home products and appliances. I often cover topics that relate to measuring and improving quantifiable aspects of your home environment. For Forbes Vetted specifically, I\u2019ve tested and reviewed portable air conditioners, air purifiers and tower fans. My work has also appeared on The Spruce, MyDomaine and U.S. News & World Report. It\u2019s also important to note that I\u2019ve long been concerned about the quality of the tap water in my Florida home, where I can\u2019t install a whole-house filter system or under-sink option, so I was eager to challenge top pitchers to purify my drinking water. Along with conducting hours of research into water quality standards, filter media and the purpose (and limitations) of water filter pitchers, I consulted several experts to get their input on what to look for in these vessels. Rick Andrew, a consultant on drinking water treatment certification strategies and a voting member of the NSF Joint Committee on Drinking Water Treatment Units, explained the most pertinent NSF/ANSI standards for water filtration devices. Then, Sydney Evans, senior science analyst at the Environmental Working Group, weighed in on the growing concern over PFAS, also known as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d which are found in everything from furniture to cosmetics to drinking water. Kyle Postmus, the senior business manager for residential water filtration at NSF, provided information on how consumers can verify NSF certification for water filters. Lastly, registered dietitian nutritionist Maya Feller of Brooklyn-based Maya Feller Nutrition provided some context on how to know which contaminants to prioritize when comparing water filter pitchers. What Are The Benefits Of A Water Filter Pitcher? A water filter pitcher makes it easy to drink pure, clean-tasting water at home. While faucet-mounted filters and under-the-sink purification systems have the edge over filtered pitchers in terms of reducing contaminants, the latter are certainly more convenient, as no installation is required. Whenever you want cold, filtered water, all you have to do is reach into the fridge and grab the pitcher. (That is, as long as no one in your household has neglected to refill the water reservoir.) With one of the best water filter pitchers, you can feel good about the quality of your H2O: Many filter a wide range of contaminants, including heavy metals (lead, copper, mercury and others), PFAS, trace pharmaceuticals and by-products of disinfectants. How Do You Clean A Water Filter Pitcher? Because each pitcher has a unique construction, it\u2019s best to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for care and cleaning. While some filters are dishwasher-safe, hand-washing with dish soap and a soft sponge is often the wisest approach. Whatever you do, make sure you don\u2019t wash the filter media, which will render it unusable. For more detailed instructions, check out this guide to cleaning a water filter pitcher. How Often Does The Filter Need To Be Replaced? To function effectively, a pitcher\u2019s filter needs to be replaced periodically. How often this needs to be done depends on two main factors: the longevity of the filter and the starting quality of your tap water. Some filters need to be replaced as often as every 20 to 40 gallons, while others can last for 100 gallons or more. So, let\u2019s say you drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day\u2014that\u2019s a half gallon of water. If you live with another person who drinks a comparable amount, you should expect to replace the filter every one to three months. But remember, if your tap water has a lot of impurities, you might end up replacing the filter more frequently.

MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 6 Best Water Filter Pitchers, Based On Extensive Testing By Erica Puisis Contributor The 9 Best Memory Foam Mattress Toppers That Offer Contouring Support By Alison Barretta Contributor How We Chose The Best Tumblers To determine the best tumblers, we kept a variety of sizes and price points in mind, in addition to a few other crucial factors. We started by identifying the most popular tumbler brands on the market, such as Stanley, Hydro Flask, Fellow and Yeti, to ensure our picks reflected the market. However, we also made sure to consider lesser-known brands and models that might deserve to be on more people\u2019s radars. In each case, we evaluated the tumbler\u2019s insulation properties, ease of drinking, how splash-proof or leak-proof they were, and how easy they were to clean. In addition to our own assessments, we took into account the feedback from online reviewers as we made our selections. What To Look For In the Best Tumblers Tumblers can occupy considerable space in your kitchen cabinet. Here are a few factors to consider before adding one to your collection. Material And Insulation You can find tumblers crafted in various materials, but all the tumblers on this list are made from stainless steel\u2014and with good reason. Stainless steel is durable and lightweight, usually without imparting unwanted flavors onto drinks. (The Fellow Carter Cold Tumbler is made from ceramic-coated stainless steel for an even cleaner, crisper flavor than uncoated stainless steel.) If you aim to keep drinks cold for an extended period, opt for stainless steel tumblers with double-walled vacuum insulation, such as the Stanley IceFlow Stainless Steel Tumbler. Lid, Straw And Spout Before purchasing a tumbler, it's important to determine your preferred sipping style. Do you prefer drinking directly from the lid or an open cup? Are you fond of a splash-resistant spout that can be tucked away when not in use? Perhaps you only enjoy drinking iced coffee through a straw. Whatever your preference, there's a tumbler to match. In some cases, you can even purchase interchangeable lids for the same tumbler, allowing you to match your lid to your mood. Easy To Clean When you discover a great tumbler, it quickly becomes part of your everyday routine. That means it will frequently get dirty, whether from leftover coffee, smoothies, lemonade or whatever else you fill it with. For easy cleanup, look for a durable, dishwasher-friendly tumbler. If your tumbler comes with a straw, consider investing in an inexpensive cleaning brush to keep the inside sparkling and gunk-free. What is the Best Brand for Tumblers? There are several popular tumbler brands on the market, but perhaps none are as popular as Stanley Tumblers. In recent years, Stanley\u2019s large, handled tumblers, which come equipped with straws, have taken social media by storm. We included a tumbler by Stanley on this list, specifically the Stanley IceFlow Stainless Steel Tumbler, which features a handle on the top for ease of carrying. Additionally, we included tumblers from other leading insulated drinkware brands like Hydro Flask and Yeti. However, our overall favorite was the Owala Stainless Steel Travel Tumbler, which stood out for its durability, excellent insulation and easy cleaning. Ultimately, the best brand for tumblers will vary from person to person and what they're looking for. Nevertheless, any of the tumblers on this list are a reliable choice.

Now, sleepers have their pick of mattresses, from luxurious hybrids to several types of foam, including latex. The best latex mattresses combine standout features from the innerspring and memory foam worlds to provide support and pressure relief\u2014minus the heat retention. The Avocado Green Mattress, our top pick, not only offers medium-firm comfort, it\u2019s also crafted from quality sustainable materials. After reviewing dozens of latex mattresses, we named the Avocado Green Mattress the best latex ... [+] mattress overall. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailer Latex mattresses vary significantly from one to the next, so we consulted our mattress editors and certified sleep experts to round up the best latex mattresses with high scores across the board. From all-foam to hybrid models, here are the eight best latex mattresses that appeal to different sleepers and budgets. Best Latex Mattress Overall: Avocado Green (Queen) Best Cooling Latex Mattress: Saatva Latex Hybrid (Queen) Best Latex Mattress For Back Pain: Bear Natural Latex Hybrid (Queen) Best Latex Mattress For Combination Sleepers: WinkBeds EcoCloud Hybrid (Queen) Best Latex Mattress For Couples: Awara Natural Hybrid (Queen) Best Mattress For Stomach Sleepers: PlushBeds The Botanical Bliss (Queen) Best Affordable Latex Mattress: EcoSleep Luxe (Queen) Best Latex Mattress For Side Sleepers: Nolah Natural Latex (Queen) Best Latex Mattress Overall A Customer Favorite That's Sustainable And Healthy MOST POPULAR Avocado Avocado Green (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Plush, medium or firm | Trial: 365 days | Warranty: 25 years Pros: Generous trial and warranty Three firmness levels Quality latex with multiple certifications Cons: Medium and plush models have an additional charge With an Avocado Green Mattress, you can sleep soundly knowing your bed is made with some of the cleanest and most sustainable natural materials available. The company uses sustainably sourced Dunlop latex from rubber trees that\u2019s processed in GOLS-certified facilities. (Dunlop latex is one of two main types of latex. It\u2019s often considered more affordable to produce and sometimes thought to be more energy efficient than its counterpart, Talalay latex.) The mattress is a hybrid, so it combines the latex foam with a supportive spring base. It\u2019s made with almost entirely organic materials\u2014the wool and cotton blend cover, as well as the latex, are all certified organic by various third-party groups. The mattress is hand-sewn, which eliminates the need for adhesive glue to hold it together. According to the company, adhesives are one source of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which can contribute to indoor air pollution. What\u2019s more, this mattress has snagged just about every \u201cfree-from\u201d and organic certification possible, including the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) organic latex label, as well as Greenguard Gold and Made Safe certifications. This mattress is also the best overall pick on our list of the best organic mattresses. You can read more about it in our full Avocado Green Mattress review. What the reviews say: \u201cI loved it since day one,\u201d writes a customer. \u201cIt has a completely different feeling than a traditional mattress or a memory foam mattress. I sleep on my side, and it\u2019s very comfortable\u2014no body aches, and I sleep longer without a need to keep turning.\u201d Another review notes, \u201c[I] love this mattress. It's super comfortable [and] smells great. And with the pillow top, it feels like a luxurious hotel bed.\u201d Best Cooling Latex Mattress A Breathable Hybrid Mattress With A Heat-Wicking Cover Saatva Saatva Latex Hybrid (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium-firm | Trial: 365 days | Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty Pros: Free white glove delivery Excellent cooling features Generous trial and warranty Cons: Expensive In general, natural latex tends to sleep cooler and offer more breathability than synthetic substances like memory foam. For people who can\u2019t compromise on cooling, we recommend the Saatva Latex Hybrid. This mattress has a cotton cover that wicks heat away from your body as you sleep. Directly beneath the cover is a 3-inch GOLS-certified organic latex layer that is also vented with airflow channels so your body heat quickly escapes the foam. At its base, the mattress has pocketed innerspring coils that lend a responsive, bouncy feel. What the reviews say: A 5-star review says, \u201cFrom the moment we laid down on it, we were sold. We sleep soundly and cool. My husband is always h0t natured, but he has no issues with this mattress.\u201d Another adds, \u201cThe Latex Hybrid is a side sleeper's delight. I have no more back pain, no pressure point pain and best of all, I no longer feel scalded by my bed if I wake up hot during the night. If I'm too warm, the latex dissipates the heat and gets me back to sleep quickly.\u201d Best Latex Mattress For Back Pain A Vegan Latex Mattress With Ample Lumbar Support Bear Bear Natural Latex Hybrid (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium-firm | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty Pros: Advanced coil system for lumbar support Comes in a ton of mattress sizes Cons: While the company is established, this is a new model launched in 2024 with no reviews If you have back pain, you need a mattress that maintains your spinal alignment throughout the night\u2014a prospect that\u2019s more challenging if you change positions as you sleep. The Bear\u2019s all-natural latex mattress combines a zoned coil system for ample lumbar support with pressure-relieving foam layers. The higher gauge coils are strategically placed in the center of the mattress, where you need the most support. Reinforced coils are also placed along the perimeter to ensure enhanced edge support when lying close to the side and overall integrity of the mattress. Every mattress is engineered and customized at the company's facility in the U.S. The Bear Natural has also gone through a rigorous testing process to be Greenguard Gold Certified for low emissions and it uses Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified cotton in the cover, so it's soft to the touch. For cushioning and comfort, the Talalay latex is the star of the show. It provides a unique medium-firm feel without too much bounce or sink. An additional foam comfort layer placed just above the coils is designed to adapt to your body and position and provide additional pressure relief and motion isolation. What our editors say: Forbes Vetted senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman, who tested the Bear Natural in a showroom, says its \u201cblend of foams and latex hits a comfortable sweet spot.\u201d In her review of the mattress, she writes, \u201cThe Bear Natural has a medium-firm feel that can work for most sleepers, along with a balance of pressure relief and support that can be hard to find.\u201d Best Latex Mattress For Combination Sleepers A Latex Mattress With A Strong Innerspring Base WinkBeds WinkBeds EcoCloud Hybrid (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty Pros: Entirely natural and organic materials Handmade to order in the U.S. Cons: Might be too plush for heavier body frames A hybrid, like this one from WinkBeds, allows you to enjoy the nontoxic and bouncy properties of latex foam without worrying if you\u2019re in for a backache within a few years\u2014that\u2019s when all-foam options might start to show wear and tear. WinkBeds\u2019 EcoCloud Mattress has a 4-inch layer of Talalay latex above reinforced, individually pocketed coils made from recycled steel, which are designed to adjust to pressure. The company also used different coils around the perimeter of the mattress to ensure it provides adequate edge support. According to a customer service agent, the exterior coils are \u201cstronger, lower gauge, bigger [in] diameter [and] more supportive.\u201d The mattress has a cover that\u2019s made from a blend of wool and certified organic cotton for a cozy but breathable finish. What the reviews say: \u201cI now have two (one in each bedroom),\u201d writes a repeat customer. \u201cIt\u2019s temperature neutral, has consistent support and is soft on pressure points without feeling soft overall. It\u2019s not the cheapest, but it is made of biodegradable materials (not that I\u2019ll be throwing it out any time soon).\u201d A combination sleeper says, \u201cI wanted a bed for side and back sleeping that did not have the off-gassing of most foam beds. This one is perfect. Super comfortable and minimal, if any, smell after opening the package. I look forward to sleeping on it every night, and the aches that I had in the past are gone.\u201d Best Latex Mattress For Couples A Mattress With Minimal Motion Transfer Awara Awara Natural Hybrid (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium-firm | Trial: 365 days | Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty Pros: Low motion transfer Excellent trial and warranty Affordable Cons: Might be too firm for lightweight sleepers This hybrid latex mattress layers 2 inches of organic Dunlop latex under a smooth cover that\u2019s crafted from two organic fibers: cotton and wool. Beneath the cover you find foam and 8-inch pocketed coils, which can help the mattress feel stable as someone moves about\u2014switching positions or getting up for a midnight bathroom run (you often hear this called \u201cmotion transfer\u201d). These layers work together to create a bouncy surface that can help you sleep deeply, regardless of whether the person you share a bed with tends to be a bit fidgety at night. What the reviews say: \"Both my wife and I love it,\" says a customer praising the motion isolation. \"[We have] no aches [and] no pains, just long and restful sleep. We joke that we can\u2019t wait to go to bed. One more thing\u2014I weigh 300 pounds. It supports me with ease, and my wife says that she can barely tell when I roll over.\u201d Another review notes, \u201cI love the comfort and bounce that this mattress has. I have slept very comfortably since I received it. I love that is a \u2018green\u2019 mattress. The fact that is organic and sustainably produced is one of the main reasons I bought [it].\u201d Best Mattress For Stomach Sleepers A Completely Customizable Mattress Crafted In California Plushbeds PlushBeds The Botanical Bliss (Queen) Type: All latex | Firmness: Medium or medium-firm | Trial: 100 nights | Warranty\ufeff: Lifetime warranty Pros: Choose between nine sizes, three heights and two firmness levels Multiple certifications Cons: Shorter trial period You may need to assemble the top layers yourself With an abundance of customizable options, the PlushBeds Organic Latex Mattress can suit many sleeping positions and comfort levels. However, the company cites the medium-firm option as a great choice for stomach sleepers who need more support without sacrificing comfort. If a mattress is soft and sinks in too much, stomach sleepers experience hip and spine sinking, which can lead to back pain. This latex option is available in sizes twin through California king, including split queen, king and California king, allowing couples to choose their ideal match. Plus, you can select the 9-, 10- or 12-inch height and use this mattress with a box spring, platform bed or adjustable base. Health and quality are a top concern for PlushbBeds, which is why this mattress is handcrafted in California from the finest certified materials, including GOLS-certified organic latex, GOTS-certified organic cotton and GOTS-certified organic wool. As a bonus, it\u2019s also Greenguard Gold certified, so you can be sure it\u2019s been tested and cleared for thousands of harmful substances. Regarding the mattress construction, it\u2019s made entirely of organic latex, starting with the dense Dunlop latex support core for pressure relief and durability up to the comfort layer of natural Talalay latex. What the reviews say: \u201cI am a stomach sleeper, and medium-firm works best for me, as the most firm mattress causes too much pressure at my joints,\u201d says one reviewer. \u201cWe love the cooling effect of it too. [It\u2019s] very relaxing. We fall asleep and awaken blissfully.\u201d A 5-star review says, \u201cThis bed has been so luxurious and so comfortable. We\u2019ve had it for about two months. I can\u2019t imagine ever sleeping on anything else now that I\u2019ve slept on this bed. It\u2019s like sleeping on a cloud but fully supported. I sleep on my side, my tummy and my back, and I feel comfortable in every position. My husband feels the same way. We are ecstatic with our purchase.\u201d Best Affordable Latex Mattress Organic Materials Paired With An Innerspring At A Lower Price EcoSleep EcoSleep Luxe (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium-firm | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: 10 years Pros: Affordable Multiple certifications Made in the U.S. Cons: Trial and warranty are on the lower end This hybrid mattress has many standout features at a significantly lower price than comparable options. What's more, it's made with luxurious, natural materials, including Talalay latex, organic wool and cashmere. The core of the mattress includes 8 inches of coils for motion isolation, pressure relief and edge support, and several layers of latex to provide that buoyant feel to relax your muscles and relieve tension. Cashmere, wool and cotton are used in the top layers for cushion, breathability and temperature control. This hybrid model holds many certifications, including GOTS, Greenguard Gold, Eco-Institut and Fair Trade, all of which signify that it\u2019s free of toxic materials and made with ethically sourced and organic materials. What the reviews say: \"Great mattress,\" says a 5-star review. \u201c[The] only down part is that it's super comfy [so] I don't want to get out of bed.\" A repeat customer writes, \"[I] ordered three EcoSleep Mattresses for our new home. [I] started with two and loved them, so [I] ordered another for the last bedroom. They\u2019re ridiculously comfortable, and I feel great knowing we are sleeping on safe and earth-friendly materials. There are so many toxic materials in most mattresses. These are clean and like sleeping on a cloud.\" Best Latex Mattress For Side Sleepers An Eco-Friendly Mattress With Spinal Support Nolah Nolah Natural Latex (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime Pros: Hypoallergenic Budget-friendly Cons: Might be too soft for some stomach sleepers The Nolah Natural Latex Mattress is a hybrid model that stands out for its use of organic materials, including cotton, wool, recycled steel coils and Talalay latex. This type of latex, as claimed by many mattress companies, offers a more bouncy feel than Dunlop latex, adding to the comfort and support of the mattress. Side sleepers need cushioning and support in order to lessen the intensity on pressure points without compromising spinal alignment. This latex model is crafted to do both, with gentle contouring and a responsive bounce that cushions bones and joints without sinking in. Designed in the U.S. with eco-friendly materials, this model is also suitable for those with allergies. It holds Greenguard Gold, GOTS and Eco-Institut certifications and is free of fiberglass. What the reviews say: \"Very comfortable mattress,\" says a 5-star review. \"I find that I fall asleep faster, sleep deeper and wake up less during the night. I sleep in all positions and notice the most comfort when on my side and back.\" A side sleeper notes, \"I am a predominantly left-side sleeper with very little right-side and back. I received my Nolah Natural 11 in late November, before Turkey Day. Since then, I have been getting better sleep than I have since I don't know when. I have no pressure point aches in the morning and feel very rested. There is minimal motion when the wife or I move during sleep, and edges are firm enough to sit and put socks on.\" MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 6 Best Water Filter Pitchers, Based On Extensive Testing By Erica Puisis Contributor The 9 Best Memory Foam Mattress Toppers That Offer Contouring Support By Alison Barretta Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted Writers, editors and contributors here at Forbes Vetted are constantly adding to our mattress and sleep content with expertly researched articles. From the best mattresses of 2024 to the best organic mattresses, we\u2019ve published a large library of mattress guides that address different materials, constructions and sleep preferences. Forbes Vetted contributors Kate Watson and Bre Richey, the authors of this article, have over a decade of combined writing and editing experience. Mattress and sleep editors Bridget Chapman and McKenzie Dillon are certified sleep coaches who have tested over 100 mattresses between the two of them, including many latex options. We\u2019ve built relationships with the most reputable bedding brands so we can keep tabs on the latest models and maintain access to industry experts. For this guide, we interviewed a spokesperson for the Avocado Green Mattress to learn more about its construction. To ensure our recommendations stay current, we periodically update this story to reevaluate our picks. It was last updated in May 2024 with new latex mattress recommendations, including the Bear Natural, EcoSleep Luxe and Nolah Natural, along with helpful information comparing latex and memory foam mattresses. How We Chose The Best Latex Mattresses We first sought out highly rated latex mattresses from brands we trust and evaluated them by key features like firmness, comfort, support, pressure relief and temperature regulation. Because (natural) latex mattresses are often considered an eco-friendly choice, we kept tabs on which ones hold certifications from Greenguard Gold, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS). Our mattress and sleep editors have tested and reviewed several latex mattresses. We leveraged their expertise to narrow down our list further. To make the final cut, each mattress needed a generous trial period (meaning you get to test your bed at home risk-free) as well as a fair warranty to uphold the company\u2019s claims of quality. What To Consider When Shopping For A Latex Mattress Price Latex beds range in price from $950 to $3,000 for a queen size, with organic and natural latex beds on the upper end of that range. Although natural latex beds often cost more upfront than other types, they last longer than any other mattress type\u2014as long as 15 to 20 years. (Just remember to place your bed on a secure foundation, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the construction.) Firmness In general, latex is naturally firmer than other materials, which is why most of the latex mattresses on the market are classified as medium or medium-firm. However, each bed\u2019s firmness also depends on how the mattress is constructed and if it\u2019s combined with other materials. For example, the Avocado Green Mattress spokesperson explains that its mattress \u201cuses three seamless layers of organic latex\u20142 inches of soft latex in the top comfort layer, 3 inches of firm latex in the middle and 4 inches of firm latex at the base. The result is an all-latex mattress with just the right level of response and bounce.\u201d If you prefer a softer bed but are still interested in latex, look for options with a pillow top or additional comfort layers for a plusher feel. Sleeping Position Because latex mattresses provide gentle yet firm support, they can be a match for all sleepers (depending on the model). If you\u2019re a side sleeper, a soft to medium-firm latex mattress is likely to be a good fit as it provide pressure relief for the shoulders and hips while slightly conforming to your body. A medium-firm or firm latex mattress is best for those who sleep on their stomach or back and need the most support. It\u2019s also worth noting that latex can be bouncy, so it\u2019s important to find the right mattress if you want to avoid that. Body Weight Your individual body weight directly impacts how firm or soft a mattress feels to you. Heavyweight sleepers over 250 pounds generally notice beds feel softer than advertised, whereas lightweight sleepers (those who weigh under 130 pounds) find that mattresses feel a touch firmer. For these reasons, we recommend that heavier individuals consider a firm bed, while lightweight people consider softer options. Pressure Relief Pressure relief refers to a mattress\u2019s ability to take stress off weight-bearing areas of the body, and the points that need the most relief depend on your go-to sleeping position. Side sleepers typically need pressure relief around the shoulders, while back sleepers need relief for the hips and lower back. Luckily for all sleep positions, latex mattresses excel at pressure relief since they have a similar contouring sensation as memory foam, but a more supportive feel. Temperature Regulation If you sweat at night or just hate getting warm while sleeping, latex could be an excellent choice. Experts at Avocado Green Mattress say, \u201cDunlop latex is naturally cooler than memory foam.\u201d This is because rubber is a temperature-regulating polymer. Plus, the actual structure of latex mattresses allows for optimal ventilation. Trustworthy Certifications When dealing with organic or natural materials, it\u2019s always a smart idea to check for certifications. Here are a few certifications to prioritize: Greenguard Gold: Cuts down on indoor pollution and ensures it\u2019s certified for low chemical emissions. GOTS and GOLS: When a latex mattress states that it\u2019s organic, it must have GOLS-certified latex foam and GOTS-certified cotton and wool. Eco-Institut: A standard for products fulfilling strict requirements on pollutants and emissions. How Latex Mattresses Are Made Natural latex mattresses are made from the sap of rubber trees. Each tree is tapped to extract the sap, also known as liquid latex. This process is sustainable and eco-friendly, since the trees live long lives and continue to give sap for years. Transforming the liquid latex into foam is a complex process that involves mixing it with other ingredients until it's entirely smooth and keeping the liquid from turning into a solid too quickly. Dunlop Latex The next step, how you mold that smooth liquid into a solid foam, is the difference between Dunlop and Talalay latex. For Dunlop latex, the liquid is poured into a mold and undergoes a vulcanization process, meaning it's processed with heat and sulfur to achieve a more durable, resilient and firmer product. Talalay Latex Talalay latex involves the extra step of vacuum sealing and flash freezing the liquid while it's in the mold before the vulcanization process. This step ensures the foam maintains a more consistent structure, resulting in a plusher, more responsive latex foam with excellent pressure relief. Synthetic Latex Some mattresses are designed using synthetic latex, which is not made from trees at all. Instead, this material is a blend of fibers, fillers and chemicals. It breaks down faster than natural latex and is also more likely to off-gas, or release packaging smells. Latex Foam Mattresses Vs. Memory Foam Mattresses While latex and memory foam may seem interchangeable, they are actually very different materials. Latex Foam Benefits Natural latex is eco-friendly and made from trees Sleeps cooler Tends to resist bacteria, mold and mildew Minimal off-gassing Combines the pressure relief of memory foam with the support of innersprings Longer lifespan Latex Foam Downsides May not always have good motion isolation Natural latex tends to be more expensive Heavy to move Memory Foam Benefits Superb motion isolation Budget-friendly options are available Molds to your body (a benefit for those who enjoy it) Can offer relief for painful pressure points or injuries Memory Foam Downsides Made from a plastic material called polyurethane Tends to trap heat Prone to off-gassing Not ideal for stomach sleepers Difficult to move around or change positions on Is Latex Better Than Memory Foam? Whether you prefer a latex or memory foam mattress depends entirely on your body type and sleeping preference. Those who like the sensation of sinking into their mattress are more likely to prefer a memory foam model. For sleepers who prefer to feel like they\u2019re sleeping on top of the mattress, latex is a better option. Latex generally sleeps cooler than memory foam (depending on the mattress construction), making it a better choice for those who sleep hot. Latex is also environmentally friendly, making it a top choice for those looking for eco-minded options. Since latex comes from rubber tree sap, no trees are harmed to make your mattress. Most should resist bacteria, mold and mildew, making latex mattresses a better option if you have asthma or dust mite allergies. What Are The Disadvantages Of A Latex Mattress? Latex mattresses aren't suitable for all sleepers. One disadvantage is that they tend to cost more than similar mattresses\u2014although you can find quality latex mattresses on a budget, such as the EcoSleep Luxe. Latex mattresses are also known to be heavy. While they shouldn't have as much off-gassing as memory foam models, latex can still have an initial rubber scent. Lastly, those who have a latex allergy may choose to stay away from latex mattresses, even though quality Dunlop and Talalay latex generally undergo a washing process to remove the proteins that can cause a reaction. How Do I Choose A Good Latex Mattress? When choosing any mattress, it's best to consider personal preference and sleeping position to determine the most appropriate comfort level and then find a mattress that is suitable for you. For instance, those who need a firm mattress shouldn't bother looking at plush latex mattresses, as they aren\u2019t a great fit. Other areas to pay attention to when choosing a latex mattress include trustworthy certifications, price and temperature regulation.", "summary": "The best latex mattresses are supportive, pressure-relieving and cooling.

The best vlogging cameras, including our top pick, the DJI Osmo Pocket 3, capture high-quality 4K footage and have a durable build so you can shoot videos no matter what you\u2019re shooting. Capture your sweet moves with the best vlogging cameras from Insta360, DJI and more. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailers But as a content creator, you need to define your needs first. Do you want to make long YouTube videos or 60-second TikToks and Reels? Do you want to livestream? Once decided, choose the gear that appeals to your creative vision. If you\u2019re looking to capture detailed footage without spending a fortune, the Akaso V50 Elite is a great choice; otherwise, those filming 360-degree videos want to look at the Insta360 X3. No matter your needs, here are the best vlogging cameras you can buy right now. Best Vlogging Camera Overall: DJI Osmo Pocket 3 Best Budget Action Vlogging Camera: Akaso V50 Elite Best Compact Vlogging Camera: Sony ZV-1 II Best Vlogging Camera For PoV Shots: Insta360 Go 3 Best Compact Mirrorless Vlogging Camera: Canon EOS R50 Best Action Vlogging Camera: GoPro Hero 12 Black Best 360-Degree Vlogging Camera: Insta360 X3 Best Vlogging Camera Overall Compact But Powerful Amazon DJI Osmo Pocket 3 Max video resolution: 4K (at 120 fps) | Still image resolution: 9.4 megapixels | Weight: 6.3 ounces | Live streaming capability: No | Connectivity: USB-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Display size: 2-inch touchscreen Best for: Enjoying a compact, sturdy camera that captures high-quality video footage. Pros: Handy 1-inch sensor Swivel touchscreen helps capture more angles Solid battery life Cons: Weak still photos Not waterproof The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 is a vloggers\u2019 delight. It plays on the pain points of vlogging cameras\u2014the feature-rich ones are too big to be carried everywhere and the small ones are often barebones\u2014and combines the best of both worlds. For instance, it packs a 1-inch sensor, the same size as the Sony ZV-1 II camera, to get more natural blur and improved low-light performance. The Osmo Pocket 3 is the best vlogging camera for people who work solo as it\u2019s small and compact. With that large sensor and 4K video capture, not only do you get high-quality video, but you also get features like face tracking to rotate and tilt to follow you around during filming. You can shoot for up to two hours before it needs a recharge, too. The only drawback is that it isn\u2019t very good for photos\u2014and it\u2019s not waterproof, so don\u2019t take it surfing or swimming. However, it\u2019s great for making YouTube or TikTok videos on the go, especially if you travel frequently. What the reviews say: One Amazon customer says, \u201cIt was so easy to learn how to start using it. DJI has great videos that show you step-by-step tutorials on how to use it. The battery life is incredible and the quality is amazing for such a small camera.\u201d Best Budget Action Vlogging Camera Shoot 4K Video At 60 FPS Without Breaking Your Wallet Akaso Akaso V50 Elite Max video resolution: 4K (at 60 fps) | Still image resolution: 20 megapixels | Weight: 2.8 ounces | Connectivity: USB-C, Wi-Fi | Display size: 2-inch touchscreen Best for: Capturing extreme wide-angle 4K video using a tiny camera. Pros: Affordable, especially compared to the competition Shoots 4K video (at 60 fps) and 20 megapixel still images Includes a handful of useful mounts and accessories Cons: Sluggish operation and touchscreen While the Akaso V50 Elite has many similarities to the latest GoPro Hero cameras, price is not one of them. It costs about 75% less than the most of the vlogging cameras on our list, but it can shoot up to 4K (at 60 fps) video. It\u2019s also waterproof (down to 131 feet) and offers an 8x optical zoom. Advanced image stabilization and the ability to switch between a narrow, medium or wide field of view are among its other features. At Amazon, the camera includes a handful of useful mounts and accessories\u2014two batteries, a waterproof case, 6 mounts and more\u2014that cost a fortune elsewhere. The camera itself measures just 2.4 x 1.6 x 1.2 inches and weighs a mere 2.8 ounces. You can control the Akaso V50 Elite via the camera\u2019s rear touchscreen and onboard buttons, voice commands, or from your smartphone via a mobile app. If you need an action camera that\u2019s as versatile as a GoPro action camera without the GoPro\u2019s price, this is the perfect option. What the reviews say: One Amazon customer says, \u201cI like the fact that it is small and compact. the picture quality is great and the price is excellent.\u201d Best Compact Vlogging Camera Small But Mighty, With Zoom Lens Amazon Sony ZV-1 II Max video resolution: 4K (at 30 fps) | Still image resolution: 20.1 megapixels | Weight: 10.3 ounces | Live streaming capability: Yes (Windows only) | Connectivity: USB-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Display size: 3.0-inch touchscreen Best for: Advanced vloggers and content creators. Pros: Excellent video-centric features Hot shoe mount for adding accessories Cons: Not designed for action footage Expensive The Sony ZV-1 II has the same same 1-inch, 20.1-megapixel sensor as its predecessor, but this new model offers plenty of additional improvements. It features a new 18-50mm (full-frame equivalent) f/1.8-4 lens, which gives you a wider perspective, making it the perfect walkabout point-and-shoot still camera or for use as a vlogging camera. Most of the vloggers want lightweight, portable and easy-to-use camera that produces high-quality footage, and the Sony ZV-1 II does exactly that. It features a lightweight body, Sony\u2019s Product Showcase and background blur features, plus a 2.7x optical zoom. The display can still point forward or backward, making it easy to frame your shots. You can still connect an external mic to the 3.5 mm jack but the built-in microphone is plenty good. The Sony ZV-1 II can also serve as a high-end webcam for live streaming. While this camera offers just about everything a vlogger could want\u2014it\u2019s not waterproof or designed to be used as an action camera. This model works well one-handed with Sony\u2019s optional Bluetooth shooting grip. What the reviews say: One Amazon customer says, \u201cThe audio is good enough to use without a mic. The low-light performance isn\u2019t great, but is better than my old Canon T6 by a huge margin. It\u2019s way smaller and lighter than most and results in very long run time on my DJI gimbal. The gimbal also connects to the camera and has no lag in remote commands.\u201d Best Vlogging Camera For PoV Shots Wear It Biking, Hiking And More MOST POPULAR Prakhar Khanna for Forbes Insta360 Go 3 Max video resolution: 2.7K (at 30 fps) | Still image resolution: 6.6 megapixels | Weight: 1.2 ounces | Live streaming capability: No | Connectivity: Type-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Display size: 2.2-inch touchscreen Best for: Having a go-anywhere modular camera build. Pros: Good stabilization in 2.7K Flip screen on the Action Pod Magnetic mounting opens myriad of possibilities Cons: Action Pod is not waterproof Unlike traditional action cameras, the Insta360 Go 3 is a modular camera that can go anywhere. You can take out the camera module with a single press and attach it to anything that\u2019s made of iron, thanks to the magnets. It\u2019s great for point-of-view (PoV) shots, especially with the pendant accessory that comes with it. In fact, our tester, Prakhar Khanna, recorded some amazing footage while playing soccer and riding bikes. The Insta360 Go 3 records sharp, vivid 2.7k footage, with extra room to play around with the colors in post-production within the Insta360 app. It can be attached to an Action Pod for a GoPro-like form factor with a screen with intuitive controls. It doubles as a charging unit, too. For those that need a wider field-of-view (FOV) it goes as high as 134 degrees. It\u2019s limited to a 1440p resolution but it\u2019s fine to crop in 9:6 or 1:1 for your Reels or TikToks. What the writers say: Forbes Vetted contributor Prakhar Khanna tested the Insta360 Go 3 for a few weeks and says, \u201cThe Insta360 Go 3 can go anywhere, and since it\u2019s magnetic, it can attach to a wide variety of accessories or random poles and benches in public (if you want to record yourself). I like shooting in the Freeframe video mode, which allows me to reframe the scene in post-production. It\u2019s the best compact action camera that you can buy right now.\u201d Best Compact Mirrorless Vlogging Camera Small Yet Mighty Amazon Canon EOS R50 Max video resolution: 4K (at 30 fps) | Still image resolution: 24.2 megapixels | Weight: 13.2 ounces | Live streaming capability: Yes | Connectivity: USB-C, micro-HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3.5 mm audio port | Display size: 3-inch touchscreen Best for: Creating content with the option of having interchangeable lenses. Pros: Shoots 4K video at up to 30fps Smallest, lightest and least expensive camera in Canon\u2019s EOS R series Includes electronic viewfinder Cons: No weather sealing Lacks built-in image stabilization The Canon EOS R50 mirrorless camera has a compact body that works with Canon\u2019s mirrorless RF-S lenses and can capture 24.2-megapixel still images and 4K 30 fps video. This versatile camera has 651 focus points, powered by the Digic X image processor and dual pixel CMOS AF II autofocus system. Besides offering a vertical movie mode\u2014excellent for capturing content for TikToks\u2014it has a close-up demo mode which is a must-have feature for content creators. The camera is lightweight and slightly smaller than the Canon EOS M50 Mark II, which uses Canon\u2019s EF-M lens mount. The R50 works in a wide range of lighting conditions and can record up to one hour of video at a time. You get added shooting flexibility over competing models thanks to both a 2.34 million dot electronic viewfinder and a vari-angle touchscreen LCD. Canon\u2019s Advanced A+ Assist feature automatically adjusts the camera settings for you, to help you get the best shot every time. You can buy the R50 with the RF-S 15-45mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM lens (as priced here) or you can buy the body separately for use with your other Canon lenses (an optional adapter lets you use this camera with EF-mount lenses, too). The R50 lacks the weather sealing of Canon\u2019s pricier EOS R8, though, and it doesn\u2019t have image stabilization. What the reviews say: One Amazon customer says, \u201cI have been debating on getting a camera for a few months now but I finally caved because I wanted a good camera for my wedding trip and honeymoon. Let me tell you this camera did not disappoint! My husband and I both agree this has been our best investment of 2024. The quality of the photos is insane! It is also super easy to use, a great beginner camera!\u201d Best Action Vlogging Camera Waterproof, Weather Resistant And Durable Prakhar Khanna GoPro Hero 12 Black Max video resolution: 5.3K (at 60 fps) | Still image resolution: 27 megapixels | Weight: 5.5 ounces | Live streaming capability: Yes | Connectivity: USB-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Display size: 2.3-inch touchscreen (back), 1.4 color LCD (front) Best for: Capturing extremely smooth action any setting\u2014including underwater. Pros: Can shoot at up to 5.3K (at 60 fps) Waterproof and extremely durable GP-Log support for 10-bit colors Cons: Multiple batteries needed for long shoots The GoPro Hero 12 Black is the best action vlogging camera you can buy to shoot all of your stunts. You can buy a Max Lens Mod 2.0 with a wider 177-degree FOV to add more dramatic feel to your content. The Hero 12 can record longer videos than before. During testing, it went up to 80 minutes (not consecutively) on a single charge while recording at 4K/60 fps. The improved battery life is a result of redesigned the power management system and dropped GPS support. You can now also record 16:9 content without needing to rotate the camera with Vertical mode. However, our testing found it was better to shoot in a 8:7 ratio, which gave us more room to play around with the framing in post and crop it vertically or horizontally. While you can purchase the latest GoPro Hero 12 Black for $400, we recommend going with the Creator Edition that includes a bunch of GoPro accessories aimed at creators. What the writers say: Khanna also tested the GoPro Hero 12 Black while adventuring, and says, \u201cAt around $400, the Hero 12 Black is an easy recommendation with the addition of plethora of new features including GP-Log, better HDR, Interval Photo feature\u2014all of which allow you to be more creative. I also appreciated the presence of the waterproof and durable design, which helped me capture some incredible footage of life underwater on the Andaman Islands.\u201d Honorable Mention: Leica Lens Magic Prakhar Khanna for Forbes Insta360 Ace Pro Max video resolution: 8K (at 24 fps) | Still image resolution: 48 megapixels | Weight: 6.3 ounces | Live streaming capability: Yes | Connectivity: USB-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Display size: 2.4-inch touchscreen (back), 1.4 color LCD (front) Best for: Shooting low light action shots. Pros: Excellent video quality Flip-up screen Good battery life Cons: It\u2019s quite heavy While GoPro Hero 12 Black gets our pick for the best vlogging action camera, the Insta360 Ace Pro isn\u2019t far behind. In fact, it beats the GoPro in several situations, but the Hero 12 Black remains more mainstream with better third-party accessories support. The Insta360 Ace Pro has a brilliant lens quality that can shoot high quality videos, including in 8K at 24 fps. The 16-mm full frame equivalent lens with f/2.6 was codeveloped with Leica. For instance, the Insta360 action camera shoots better low light videos than its GoPro counterpart. Our tester was impressed by the color quality on the videos shot on the Ace Pro; they look pleasing without being artificially oversaturated. The dynamic range is great and it captures true-to-life skin tones, which can be a miss on other action cameras. What the writers say: Khanna also tested the Insta360 Ace Pro and says, \u201cThe video quality on Insta360 Ace Pro is very good. It\u2019s an all-scenario action camera with amazing stabilization for adventure shots. I like it better than the GoPro Hero 12 sometimes, especially with the big flip-up screen.\u201d Best 360-Degree Vlogging Camera Captures Video At Up To 5.7K Amazon Insta360 X3 Max video resolution: 5.7K at 30 fps (360-degree video), 4K at 30 fps | Still image resolution: 72 megapixels | Weight: 6.4 ounces | Live streaming capability: Yes | Connectivity: USB-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Display size: 2.3-inch touchscreen Best for: Capturing 360-degree action video. Pros: Shoots 360-degree video Durable and waterproof Can remove optional selfie stick from content Cons: Selfie stick sold separately, unless you purchase the Get-Set or Ultimate Kit The Insta360 X3 offers an entirely different design than the GoPro cameras, but like GoPro Hero 12 Black, this camera is waterproof (down to 33-feet) and very durable. It\u2019s versatile, capable of capturing stunning 360-degree HDR video at 5.7K resolution, traditional video at up to 4K and still images at up to 72 megapixels. On one side of the camera is a 2.3-inch touchscreen; use the screen whichever way works best while filming. When shooting traditional video, the Insta360 X3 captures a 170-degree field of view at up to 4K (30 fps). If you use Insta360\u2019s own selfie-stick, as you\u2019re shooting, the camera automatically removes the optional selfie stick from your filmed content. This feature allows you to capture content in a stunning third-person perspective, so it looks like the camera is floating around you. Combine this feature with the camera\u2019s image stabilization and horizon lock to capture smooth and level content. The Insta360 X3 can capture time-lapse video at up to 8K, and slow motion video at up to 4K at 120 fps. Rounding out the camera\u2019s features are voice control; USB, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth data content transfers; and the ability to capture directional audio\u2014in stereo\u2014using four built-in microphones. What the reviews say: One Amazon customer says, \u201cAfter transitioning from GoPro to Insta360, I've found a newfound ease in capturing moments. As a non-professional user, the seamless ability to shoot both photos and videos in 360 degrees, coupled with impressive resolution, solidified my decision to switch. Insta360 has provided a level of comfort and versatility that I hadn\u2019t experienced with GoPro.\u201d MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 7 Best Tumblers To Keep You Hydrated This Summer By Leah Koenig Contributor What To Put On Your Summer Camp Packing List, According To Camp Staff By Korin Miller Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted At Forbes Vetted, we\u2019ve published many expertly researched consumer tech articles.

We first combed through reputable brands and bestselling vlogging cameras to narrow down our choices. Our writers and editors have years of experience writing about a broad range of cameras, and where applicable, expert Prakhar Khanna provided his hands-on testing for our picks. Some of his insight includes testing the GoPro Hero 12 Black and the Insta360 Go 3 vlogging cameras. We consulted with magician and social media content creator Day Mori to help us determine the best vlogging cameras. We also reviewed each vlogging camera\u2019s specs and features to determine which products stood out from the pack. Because everyone\u2019s needs are different, we made sure to include a variety of options, from 360-degree cameras like the Insta360 X3 to the best overall pick, the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. All of our top choices received at least a 4+ star rating across various sites to make sure you\u2019re getting a top-quality vlogging camera. How To Choose The Best Vlogging Camera The key to choosing the perfect vlogging camera is to consider how, where and when you expect to use the camera most. Will you be sitting indoors and speaking directly to the camera from a short distance away, or will you be running around vlogging your action-packed adventures? What is the climate like where you\u2019re filming or streaming? We break down what you need to consider to get the best vlogging camera for your needs. Resolution To make your video content look its absolute best, you want to shoot it in the highest resolution possible. This means 4K at either 30 or 60 frames per second (fps), with 60 fps typically being a better option. If you need to shoot slow-motion video, shooting at 120 fps or even 240 fps will be beneficial. Some of the newest cameras, like the GoPro Hero 12 Black, offer the ability to record at up to 5.3K resolution at 60 fps, but most online streaming/social media service don\u2019t yet support it. You can always reduce your content\u2019s resolution to 1080p, for example, while editing (during post production) or when uploading to a social media service. \u201cI typically record at 1080p, because this keeps the video file sizes more manageable when editing, storing and then uploading them to the various social media services,\u201d said Day Mori, a magician and social media content creator. Display Size (Front and Rear) For the average vlogger, a camera with both a front- and rear-facing viewfinder screen is extremely useful, especially if you\u2019ll be recording yourself. The size of the camera\u2019s display will determine how easy it is to frame your shots and see what you\u2019re filming. Meanwhile, the size of the rear (often touchscreen) display will impact how easy it is to set up the camera by adjusting its various shooting modes or settings. It also allows you to see more detail when reviewing your filmed content directly from the camera before you transfer it to your mobile device or computer. Size And Weight Especially if you plan to hold the camera in one hand while filming, or you often shoot while out and about, having a lightweight and compact camera will come in handy. Pay attention to how easy it\u2019ll be to hold the camera for extended periods while it\u2019s connected to a selfie stick, handgrip or gimbal. If you travel a lot, consider the space and weight your camera requires to carry around with you. Lens For cameras with a fixed lens, you want versatility\u2014the ability to shoot close-range, mid-range and wide-angle shots using the digital zoom feature built into the camera. If the vlogging camera you select offers interchangeable lenses, make sure you purchase at least one or two lenses based on your typical shooting requirements. The more options you have while shooting, the easier it is to capture your creative vision in a way that\u2019s compelling for your audience. According to Mori, \u201cWhen I\u2019m filming magic for social media, I like to have a wide-angle lens so I can capture as much as possible in the shot, since it\u2019s reality and you never know what\u2019s going to happen. I try to capture myself and people in my audience within many of my shots. A wide-angle lens makes this possible.\u201d Battery Life Rule number one as a vlogger is to always have extra, fully charged camera batteries on hand. You never want to miss being able to shoot time-sensitive content in the moment simply because your camera battery died. While you should pay attention to the average battery life a camera\u2019s manufacturer boasts, in the real-world, shooting time can vary. Besides having two or three extra batteries on-hand, also invest in a multi-battery charger (if available). This can speed up your battery charging time. Connectivity While all cameras offer some type of USB port that allows you to use a cable to connect the camera directly to your computer, many offer wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\u2014typically a more convenient option for transferring content from your camera to your mobile device or computer for editing and publishing online. Live Streaming Capabilities If you\u2019ve ever thought about streaming live on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram or Twitch, for example, look for a vlogging camera that touts streaming support. This means being able to connect your camera directly to your internet-connected computer or mobile device and being able to go live in the easiest way possible. Price When you\u2019re first starting out, you probably don\u2019t want to spend too much on your vlogging camera, especially since there will be a bunch of other gear you need to invest in as well\u2014such as a light and a microphone. However, as you build up your audience, you need to up your game by offering pro-quality video production. Start off by going with what you can afford now, and you can invest in better and newer equipment as your needs evolve and your audience grows. What Is The Best Vlogging Camera For Product Demos? If you\u2019re a vlogger, content creator or YouTuber who regularly does product demos to reviews, we recommend a camera that offers a \u201cProduct Showcase\u201d setting. When active, the camera can automatically and smoothly shift its focus from you to a product or object you hold up in front of you. And when you put that product down, the focus transitions back to you. These days, you can find a Product Showcase setting in a variety of cameras, including the Sony ZV-1 II, our top choice for a compact vlogging camera. What Is The Best Vlogging Camera For Outdoor Action? Again, it all depends on the filming conditions, whether you\u2019ll be filming yourself engaged in an activity and what type of action you\u2019ll be filming. For outdoor action, we durable vlogging camera, like the GoPro Hero 12 Black, Insta360 Go 3 or Insta360 X3. These cameras are compact and durable. A more traditional point-and-shoot vlogging camera, like the Sony ZV-1 II, works great outdoors, but it\u2019s best for less harsh shooting conditions. Just make sure you have the right collection of mounts and accessories to use the camera in the specific shooting conditions you\u2019ll be in. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

This discount is not uncommon, but it\u2019s the lowest we\u2019ve seen the Yemsd walking pad drop in price. What Is The Difference Between A Walking Pad And A Treadmill? Walking pads and treadmills are similar in that both have a moving belt that allows you to walk and run indoors. However, walking pads are more compact and portable than treadmills, and typically max out at lower speeds. Walking pads also typically don\u2019t have handrails, so they\u2019re not designed for the full-on running and sprinting you can do on a classic treadmill. How Fast Does A Walking Pad Go? Unlike full-size treadmills, walking pads aren\u2019t designed to go especially fast. Most max out around 4 mph, so they\u2019re best for people who are looking to get some additional steps in during the day\u2014not train for an upcoming race. Is There A Walking Pad You Can Run On? Yes\u2014some walking pads are two-in-one machines that can also function as a treadmill. For instance, the WalkingPad R1 Pro and WalkingPad R2 can reach speeds of over 6 mph for running. That said, most basic walking pads will not reach speeds high enough for you to run on, and it can be dangerous to run on a machine that doesn\u2019t have handrails. If you\u2019re more interested in a dedicated running machine, there are plenty of deals on treadmills right now as well. Is A Walking Pad Better Than A Treadmill? The answer to this question depends on your specific needs. A walking pad is an excellent option for folks who have limited space and only want to walk indoors. A treadmill, on the other hand, is ideal for someone interested in more serious running or training. If you\u2019re just looking to move your body more, a walking pad will do the trick\u2014and cost a lot less. Do Any Walking Pads Have Incline? Yes. While incline is a feature that\u2019s more commonly found in full-on treadmills, some walking pads do offer the option. For example, this Urevo Walking Pad offers a 3% incline. How Do I Choose A Walking Pad? Some of the most important considerations to make when choosing a walking pad are your budget, the size of your space and the specific features you\u2019d like your machine to have. For instance, someone living in a smaller apartment may appreciate a more compact model like the Egofit Walker Pro M1. However, if you want something you can also run on, you\u2019ll want to go with the WalkingPad R1 Pro.", "summary": "You can save up to 63% on a walking pad this week.

As you shop around for rugs, you\u2019ll notice that prices vary substantially. You can find inexpensive rugs for as low as $20 or $30, while high-end options often cost over $1,000. \u201cIt\u2019s depends on the material,\u201d Khuu says. \u201c100% wool rugs can start in the thousands for an 8 x 10-foot rug. Be prepared to shell out at least $500 for a good quality rug.\u201d At this price point, rugs are made with better quality materials and workmanship, and they will hold up better over time with less shedding and pilling. Why Are Some Rugs So Cheap? If you find a rug that\u2019s extremely inexpensive\u2014for instance, an 8 x 10-foot rug for $100\u2014chances are it\u2019s made with lower-quality synthetic materials such as polyester or nylon. Cheap rugs are typically made by machines, and you may experience issues such as off-center prints, shedding, pilling and warping. Cheap rugs are also often thin, which may not be as comfortable underfoot. \u201cRugs at a higher price point are crafted from carefully sourced natural materials, and tend to be produced with wools and jutes, and use a completely handmade process that delivers a more luxurious, organic layered feeling to a space,\u201d says Ashley Macuga, principal designer at Collected Interiors. However, that\u2019s not to say that inexpensive rugs are bad. If you like to change up the look of your home frequently, cheap rugs are a budget-friendly decorating solution that you can swap out every few years without breaking the bank. Are Wayfair And Amazon Rugs Good Quality? Because online retailers like Wayfair and Amazon sell rugs from a wide range of brands, the quality of their products may vary\u2014you may be able to find good quality rugs for reasonable prices. Still, other products might not meet your expectations. You can get a sense of the quality of a rug on one of these sites by looking at the price point, materials and other user reviews. Keep this in mind, though: Even interior designers buy rugs from Wayfair and Amazon sometimes. \u201cI have purchased many affordable rugs for clients and myself that are appropriate for families with young children off of Amazon, RugsUSA or Wayfair,\u201d Williams says. Khuu says she\u2019s done the same. \u201cI source these major retailers for both my budget and luxury clients,\u201d she says. \u201cThe trick is to filter your search according to your budget, the size required, and the material desired. There are literally thousands of options to choose from\u2014you are bound to find something you love.\u201d However, if you\u2019re willing to spend a little more to ensure the product you\u2019re buying is well-made, it\u2019s best to buy directly from a well-reputed brand, such as West Elm, Pottery Barn or Serena & Lily.", "summary": "If you're looking to elevate your living space, a rug might just do the trick.

Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall or infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers, and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available. \u201cEven minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering, gruesome injuries,\u201d the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. \u201cOlder model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk, as the age of the air bag is one of the contributing factors.\u201d Nissan originally recalled 736,422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84,000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators. The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018, the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra, according to Nissan. The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators, which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata into bankruptcy.

Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall or infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers, and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available. \u201cEven minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering, gruesome injuries,\u201d the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. \u201cOlder model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk, as the age of the air bag is one of the contributing factors.\u201d Nissan originally recalled 736,422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84,000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators. The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018, the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra, according to Nissan. The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators, which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate airbags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding airbags sent Takata into bankruptcy.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because MLB plans an official announcement on Wednesday, USA Today reported. Josh Gibson, one of the greatest sluggers in the history of the Negro Leagues, will become MLB\u2019s new all-time career leader in batting average at .372, moving ahead of Ty Cobb, USA Today reported. Gibson will also supplant Babe Ruth as the career leader in slugging percentage (.718) and On-base Plus Slugging (1.177), according to USA Today. \u201cWhen you hear Josh Gibson\u2019s name now, it\u2019s not just that he was the greatest player in the Negro Leagues,\u201d Sean Gibson, Gibson\u2019s great grandson, told USA Today Sports, \u201cbut one of the greatest of all time. These aren\u2019t just Negro League stats. They\u2019re major-league baseball stats.\u201d \u201cThis means so much for not only the Josh Gibson family, but representing the 2,300 men in the Negro Leagues who didn\u2019t get the opportunity to play [in the Major Leagues],\u201d he said. CNN has sought comment from MLB. The catcher was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. Gibson\u2019s Baseball Hall of Fame plaque \u2013 he\u2019s one of 35 Negro League stars enshrined in Cooperstown \u2013 says he \u201chit almost 800 home runs in league and independent baseball\u201d during his 17-year career. But the majority of those homers came not in league-sanctioned games (about 50 to 75 per season) but in exhibitions played against former big leaguers and white semi-pro teams. This comes about three and a half years after MLB recognized Negro Leagues as its equivalent and counted the statistics and records of thousands of Black players who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to the late 1940s. Even though that recognition happened in December 2020, MLB at the time said it needed time to review how that recognition would affect MLB record books, in part because some statistics were still being compiled and because MLB needed to sort league-sanctioned games from exhibitions. \u201cMany people have heard of Martin Dihigo and Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. But what about the thousands of other men who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948? They\u2019re being recognized finally as major league caliber ballplayers,\u201d Scott Simkus, one of the researchers credited by MLB with compiling and constructing the Seamheads Negro Leagues Database, said at the time. \u201cTheir statistical records, their careers are going to be considered equal to anybody who had played in the National League or American League during that period of time.\u201d MLB in 2020 said it was \u201ccorrecting a longtime oversight\u201d by elevating the status of the Negro Leagues \u2014 which consisted of seven leagues and about 3,400 Black and Latino players from 1920 to 1948. \u201cIt\u2019s sad this great history has been kept from them,\u201d Larry Lester, co-founder of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, said at the time. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, had said the recognition \u201cserves as historical validation for those who had been shunned from the Major Leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.\u201d (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

When the new rankings are unveiled Wednesday, The Washington Post said, \"the Top 10 lists\" for several \"hallowed statistics\" will \"change dramatically,\" notably boosting Homestead Grays powerhouse Josh Gibson (pictured above with Satchel Paige). Who said what Gibson, who died in 1947 at age 35, will overtake Ty Cobb as MLB's career leader in batting average (.372 versus .367), Hugh Duffy in single-season batting average (.446 versus .440), and Babe Ruth in slugging percentage (.718 versus .690) and OPS (1.177 versus 1.164). \"When you hear Josh Gibson's name now, it's not just that he was the greatest player in the Negro Leagues,\" Sean Gibson, Gibson's great-grandson, told USA Today, \"but one of the greatest of all time.\" The stats integration is a belated \"acknowledgment that, had Black players been allowed to compete with their white counterparts in MLB's early decades, its leader boards would look very different,\" the Post said. What next? MLB will make its new database public before a special Negro League tribute game on June 20. Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The integration also led to improved career statistics for Willie Mayes, Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson, among other baseball icons. The league officially designated play in the Negro Leagues -- from 1920 to 1948 -- as \"Major League\" in 2020. MLB said more data is \"still being discovered.\" \"We are proud that the official historical record now includes the players of the Negro Leagues,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a news release. \"This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible. \"Their accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson's 1947 Dodger debut.\" Gibson is listed with a .372 batting average in MLB's official database, better than the former top mark (.367) owned by Ty Cobb. Fellow Negro Leagues star Oscar Charleston is listed with the third-best average (.363) in history. Buck Leonard (.345), Turkey Stearnes (.348) and Jud Wilson (.350) are now the other former Negro Leagues stars in the Top 10 for career batting average. Gibson's .718 slugging percentage now leads Ruth (.690), Williams (.634) and Gehrig (.632). Negro League legends Mule Suttles (.621), Stearnes (.616), Charleston (.613) round out the Top 7 in that category. Gibson's .459 on-base percentage trails only Williams and Ruth. Leonard (.452), Charleston (.448) and Wilson (.434) also rank inside the Top 10. Gibson's 1.177 OPS -- on-base plus slugger percentage -- edges Ruth (1.164), Williams (1.116), Gehrig (1.079) and Charleston (1.061) for the new all-time mark. MLB career home run (762) leader Barry Bonds (1.051) ranks sixth in that category. Gibson's Hall of Fame plaque reads that he hit \"almost 800 home runs in league and independent baseball,\" but he is only credited with 174 in MLB's database because researchers haven't found box scores to support comprehensive totals. Several single-season records also are now attributed to Gibson. His .466 mark from the 1943 campaign with the Homestead Grays is now the best in history. Charlie \"Chino\" Smith, who hit .451 in 1929 for the Negro Leagues' New York Lincoln Giants now owns the second-best mark. Paige is now listed with a 1.01 ERA for his 1944 campaign with the Kansas City Monarchs, the third-best mark in history for a single season, behind Tim Keef and Dutch Leonard. Dave Brown, who pitched in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1925, now owns the eighth-best career ERA (2.24) -- and best ever for a Negro Leagues pitcher. The integration resulted in Micky Minoso's 150 hits with the New York Cubans being added to his total, which now eclipses 2,000 (2,113). Robinson's 49 hits from the 1945 season with the Monarch's moved his total to 1,567, which ranks No. 587. Mays' 10 hits from the 1948 season with the Birmingham Black Barons increased his total from 3,283 to 3,293. He kept his spot with the 12th-most hits in baseball history. Paige's win total was increased from 125 from 28, which is tied for No. 402 in history. MLB estimates that statistics from the Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948 are nearly 75% complete. Bill Greason (99), Mays (93) and Ron Teasley (97) are the only living former Negro Leagues players. The changes to baseball records followed an evaluation by the Negro Leagues statistical review committee. MLB leaned on decades-long work of many researchers to accumulate the statistics, as many game accounts are lost, distorted or were never recorded. \"Stories, folklore and embellished truths have long been a staple of the Negro Leagues narrative,\" baseball historian Larry Lester said. \"Those storylines will always be entertaining, but now our dialogues can be quantified and qualified to support the authentic greatest of these athletes. \"Every fan should welcome this statistical restitution toward social reparation.\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8241716990940/2024/upi/073502f17719c942cfe56346c01a1d41/v1.5/Negro-Leagues-stat-integration-makes-Josh-Gibson-new-MLB-batting-leader.jpg\"> MLB's integration of Negro League statistics made Josh Gibson the new all-time leader in batting average, slugging percentage and OPS, the league said Wednesday.

But now there's a new leader in that category: Josh Gibson, who holds a .372 lifetime batting average. The sudden dethroning is one of several notable changes now that records for more than 2,300 Negro League players were incorporated into Major League Baseball records Tuesday following a three-year research project, the Associated Press reported. The move represents a 'show of respect for great players who performed in the Negro Leagues due to circumstances beyond their control.' Gibson's .466 season batting average for the 1943 Homestead Grays is now the all-time best mark, and Charlie \"Chino\" Smith's .451 season batting average for the 1929 New York Lincoln Giants is second on the list, the AP said. Hugh Duffy of the National League's Boston team was the previous record holder for his .440 season batting average in 1894, the outlet added. Gibson tops the record books again as the career leader in slugging percentage (.718) and OPS (1.177), now besting Babe Ruth (.690 and 1.164), the AP said. OPS, according to Major League Baseball, is the sum of on-base percentage and slugging percentage, which shows how effectively a player can reach base along with how well a player hits for average and power. What's more, Gibson's .974 season slugging percentage in 1937 is now the record, and Barry Bonds' .863 season mark in 2001 drops to fifth, the AP said. Mules Suttles' .877 in 1926, Gibson's .871 in 1943, and Smith's .870 in 1929 are now the second- through fourth-place marks, the outlet added. Gibson yet again stands above the rest with a 1.474 season OPS in 1937 and a 1.435 season OPS in 1943 \u2014 nudging Bonds' 1.421 OPS in 2004 from first to third place, the AP said. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told the AP on Wednesday the move represents a \"show of respect for great players who performed in the Negro Leagues due to circumstances beyond their control, and \u2014 once those circumstances changed \u2014 demonstrated that they were truly major leaguers. Maybe the single biggest factor was the success of players who played in the Negro Leagues and then came to the big leagues.\" BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock of the \"Fearless\" podcast offered the following opinion about the Negro League stats being added to MLB stats \u2014 particularly as it relates to the dethroning of Cobb: \"Knocking Ty Cobb down as the all-time batting champion is likely a big part of the motivation to rewrite baseball history. Ty Cobb was a despicable bigot, which still makes him 100 times better than the pro-abortion folks. Let\u2019s hope no one who paid for an abortion ever played Major League Baseball.\" This story has been updated. Like Blaze News?

The Kennedy campaign claims CNN is approaching the debate criteria differently for Kennedy, an independent candidate, than for Trump and Mr. Biden, the presumptive nominees of their respective parties. CNN is holding the first presidential debate in Atlanta on June 27, before either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party hold their conventions to formalize their nominees. The Kennedy campaign is alleging the debate is an illegal campaign contribution to both Mr. Biden and Trump. \"CNN is making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and the Biden committee and the Trump committee have accepted these prohibited corporate contributions,\" the complaint says. CNN's debate criteria says a candidate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 threshold for the presidency, and receive at least 15% in four major national polls by June 20. Kennedy has not yet met the polling criteria or the ballot appearance criteria. Still, the Kennedy campaign argues that, since neither Trump nor Mr. Biden has been officially nominated, they aren't eligible for any electoral votes, while Kennedy says he may qualify in a handful of states. Candidates still have several weeks to meet the qualification threshold. RFK Jr.'s quest to get on the presidential ballot in all 50 states\"By demanding our campaign meet different criteria to participate in the debate than Presidents Biden and Trump, CNN's debate violates FEC law and is a large prohibited corporate contribution to both the Biden and Trump campaigns,\" Kennedy said.RFK Jr. says he suffered from a parasitic brain worm and mercury poisoningThe Kennedy campaign is asking the FEC to find the parties in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, and stop them from participating in the debate for now. CNN, however, defended their qualification rules. \"The law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning,\" a CNN spokesperson said. \"As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK, Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"Both the Biden and Trump campaigns have also agreed to debate on ABC on Sept. 10.

Opening a short visit to eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau before traveling to the Czech Republic, Blinken announced the assistance at a news conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022, $300 million of which was earmarked for energy security. Blinken\u2019s trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, comes amid concerns that Moldova and the former Soviet republic of Georgia are facing renewed threats from Russia. The trip comes two weeks after Blinken made an unannounced trip to Ukraine to reassure Kyiv of Washington\u2019s support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north. There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, where it has 1,500 troops stationed in the disputed territory of Transnistria, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union. Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc. \u201cThere\u2019s not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there\u2019s ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,\u201d the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O\u2019Brien, said last week. Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a \u201chybrid war\u201d against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU. Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow\u2019s intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for \u201cprotection\u201d due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau. In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country\u2019s parliament overrode a presidential veto of a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia\u2019s chances of joining the European Union. The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as \u201cpursuing the interests of a foreign power\u201d if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn\u2019t do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law. Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country\u2019s future and \u201chindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\u201d Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials \u201cwho are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.\u201d Blinken\u2019s announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation. \u201cIt remains our hope that Georgia\u2019s leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation\u2019s democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia\u2019s actions in deciding our own.\u201d The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday that will be the alliance\u2019s last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO\u2019s 80th anniversary in Washington in July. ___ Lee reported from Prague.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova\u2019s energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine\u2019s, which were being hit hard by Russia\u2019s military. Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy. On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. \u201cWe managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.\u201d \u201cThanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,\u201d she added.

America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation. \u201cThat in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,\u201d Blinken said. He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later. Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security. Blinken\u2019s trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia. Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington\u2019s support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north. There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova, where it has 1,500 troops stationed in the disputed territory of Transnistria, and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union. Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc. \u201cThere\u2019s not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there\u2019s ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,\u201d the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week. Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a \u201chybrid war\u201d against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU. Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow\u2019s intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for \u201cprotection\u201d due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau. In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia\u2019s chances of joining the European Union. The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as \u201cpursuing the interests of a foreign power\u201d if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn\u2019t do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law. Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country\u2019s future and \u201chindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.\u201d Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials \u201cwho are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.\" Blinken\u2019s announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation. \u201cIt remains our hope that Georgia\u2019s leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation\u2019s democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia\u2019s actions in deciding our own.\u201d The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday that will be the alliance\u2019s last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO\u2019s 80th anniversary in Washington in July. ___ Lee reported from Prague.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security. Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military. Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy. On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. \"We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,\" she said. \"Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.\" \"Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,\" she added.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a \"hybrid war\" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU. \"Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermining its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,\" Blinken said. \"I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.\" Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow\u2019s intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for \"protection\" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

Critics say he's deflecting from his own problems", "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 After the International Criminal Court\u2019s top prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister and top Hamas officials, the Israeli leader accused him of being one of \u201cthe great antisemites in modern times.\u201d As protests roiled college campuses across the United States over the Gaza war, Netanyahu said they were awash with \u201cantisemitic mobs.\u201d These are just two of the many instances during the war in which Netanyahu has accused critics of Israel or his policies of antisemitism, using fiery rhetoric to compare them to the Jewish people\u2019s worst persecutors. But his detractors say he is overusing the label to further his political agenda and try to stifle even legitimate criticism, and that doing so risks diluting the term\u2019s meaning at a time when antisemitism is surging worldwide. \u201cNot every criticism against Israel is antisemitic,\u201d said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian. \u201cThe moment you say it is antisemitic hate ... you take away all legitimacy from the criticism and try to crush the debate.\u201d There has been a spike in antisemitic incidents since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, according to researchers. And many Jews in North America and Europe have said they feel unsafe, citing threats to Jewish schools and synagogues and the pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations in the U.S., although organizers deny that antisemitism drives the protests. The war has reignited the long debate about the definition of antisemitism and whether any criticism of Israel \u2014 from its military\u2019s killing of thousands of Palestinian children to questions over Israel\u2019s very right to exist \u2014 amounts to anti-Jewish hate speech. Netanyahu, the son of a scholar of medieval Jewish persecution, has long used the travails of the Jewish people to color his political rhetoric. And he certainly isn\u2019t the first world leader accused of using national trauma to advance political goals. Netanyahu\u2019s supporters say he is honestly worried for the safety of Jews around the world. But his accusations of antisemitism come as he has repeatedly sidestepped accountability for not preventing Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack. Hamas killed roughly 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, which many in Israel\u2019s defense establishment acknowledge they shoulder the blame for. Netanyahu has continued to face criticism at home and abroad throughout the war, which has killed 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between fighters and noncombatants. The fighting has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe, and ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has accused Netanyahu and his defense minister of using starvation as a \u201cmethod of warfare,\u201d among other crimes. Segev, the historian, acknowledged there is a rise in \u201cviolent hate\u201d toward Israel and, speaking from Vienna, said he wasn\u2019t sure if speaking Hebrew in public was safe. But he said Netanyahu has long used Jewish crises to his political benefit, including invoking the Jewish people\u2019s deepest trauma, the Holocaust, to further his goals. At the height of the campus protests, Netanyahu released a video statement condemning their \u201cunconscionable\u201d antisemitism and comparing the mushrooming encampments on college greens to Nazi Germany of the 1930s. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in America\u2019s college campuses is horrific,\u201d he said. In response to Khan seeking the arrest warrants, he said the ICC prosecutor was \u201ccallously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging across the world,\u201d comparing him to German judges who approved of the Nazis\u2019 race laws against Jews. Netanyahu has compared accusations that Israel\u2019s war is causing starvation in Gaza or that the war is genocidal to blood libels \u2014 unfounded centuries-old accusations that Jews sacrificed Christian children and used their blood to make unleavened bread for Passover. \u201cThese false accusations are not levelled against us because of the things we do, but because of the simple fact that we exist,\u201d he said at a ceremony marking Israel\u2019s Holocaust Remembrance Day earlier this month. Netanyahu previously made repeated allusions to the Holocaust while trying to galvanize the world against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Israeli leaders and the country\u2019s media also made such comparisons about Oct. 7, describing the Hamas attackers as Nazis, comparing their rampage to the historic violence inflicted on Eastern European Jews, and referring to the images of Jewish victims\u2019 burned bodies as a Shoah \u2014 the Hebrew word for Holocaust. Israelis have been jarred by the global rise in antisemitism, and many view the swell of criticism against Israel as part of the rise. They see hypocrisy in the world\u2019s intense focus on Israel\u2019s war with Hamas while other conflicts get much less attention. Moshe Klughaft, a former advisor to Netanyahu, said he believes the Israeli leader is genuinely concerned over rising antisemitism. \u201cIt is his duty to condemn antisemitism as prime minister of Israel and as head of a country that sees itself as responsible for world Jewry,\u201d he said. Many Israelis view the war in Gaza as a just act of self-defense and are befuddled by what many think should be criticism directed at Hamas \u2014 blaming the group for starting the war, using Palestinian civilians as human shields and refusing to free the hostages. The ICC warrant requests have likely bolstered such feelings. When Netanyahu leans on accusations of antisemitism, he is doing so with the Israeli public in mind, said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University. Hazan said Netanyahu has leveraged the campus protests, for example, to get Israelis to rally around him at a time when his public support has plummeted and Israelis are growing impatient with the war. He said Netanyahu has also used the protests as a scapegoat for his failure so far to achieve the war\u2019s two goals: destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. \u201cHe deflects blame from himself, attributing any shortcomings not to his foreign policies or policies in the (Palestinian) territories, but rather to antisemitism. This narrative benefits him greatly, absolving him of responsibility,\u201d Hazan said. Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem think thank, rejects the notion that Netanyahu stifles criticism by calling it antisemitic, pointing to just how much criticism the country receives. But he said using the antisemitic label to achieve political ends could cheapen it. \u201cI\u2019d be more selective than the government of Israel in choosing the people and bodies they tag \u2018antisemitic,\u2019\u201d he said.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2lzcmFlbC1uZXRhbnlhaHUtYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLWNhbXB1cy0wNWViZDcxYmVjOTMxYTYyZjU4ZTdkNWY5ZTkzZmExOdIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Netanyahu frequently makes claims of antisemitism.

But his detractors say he is overusing the label to further his political agenda and try to stifle even legitimate criticism, and that doing so risks diluting the term\u2019s meaning at a time when antisemitism is surging worldwide. \u201cNot every criticism against Israel is antisemitic,\u201d said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian. \u201cThe moment you say it is antisemitic hate \u2026 you take away all legitimacy from the criticism and try to crush the debate.\u201d There has been a spike in antisemitic incidents since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, according to researchers. And many Jews in North America and Europe have said they feel unsafe, citing threats to Jewish schools and synagogues and the pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations in the U.S., although organizers deny that antisemitism drives the protests. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union. The war has reignited the long debate about the definition of antisemitism and whether any criticism of Israel \u2014 from its military\u2019s killing of thousands of Palestinian children to questions over Israel\u2019s very right to exist \u2014 amounts to anti-Jewish hate speech. Netanyahu, the son of a scholar of medieval Jewish persecution, has long used the travails of the Jewish people to color his political rhetoric. And he certainly isn\u2019t the first world leader accused of using national trauma to advance political goals. Netanyahu\u2019s supporters say he is honestly worried for the safety of Jews around the world. But his accusations of antisemitism come as he has repeatedly sidestepped accountability for not preventing Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack. Hamas killed roughly 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, which many in Israel\u2019s defense establishment acknowledge they shoulder the blame for. Netanyahu has continued to face criticism at home and abroad throughout the war, which has killed 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between fighters and noncombatants. The fighting has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe, and ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has accused Netanyahu and his defense minister of using starvation as a \u201cmethod of warfare,\u201d among other crimes. Segev, the historian, acknowledged there is a rise in \u201cviolent hate\u201d toward Israel and, speaking from Vienna, said he wasn\u2019t sure if speaking Hebrew in public was safe. But he said Netanyahu has long used Jewish crises to his political benefit, including invoking the Jewish people\u2019s deepest trauma, the Holocaust, to further his goals. At the height of the campus protests, Netanyahu released a video statement condemning their \u201cunconscionable\u201d antisemitism and comparing the mushrooming encampments on college greens to Nazi Germany of the 1930s. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in America\u2019s college campuses is horrific,\u201d he said. In response to Khan seeking the arrest warrants, he said the ICC prosecutor was \u201ccallously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging across the world,\u201d comparing him to German judges who approved of the Nazis\u2019 race laws against Jews. Those comments drew a rebuke from the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. \u201cThe prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism \u2014 as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu\u2019s government does not like,\u201d Borrell said. \u201cThe word antisemitic, it\u2019s too heavy. It\u2019s too important.\u201d Netanyahu has compared accusations that Israel\u2019s war is causing starvation in Gaza or that the war is genocidal to blood libels \u2014 unfounded centuries-old accusations that Jews sacrificed Christian children and used their blood to make unleavened bread for Passover. \u201cThese false accusations are not levelled against us because of the things we do, but because of the simple fact that we exist,\u201d he said at a ceremony marking Israel\u2019s Holocaust Remembrance Day earlier this month. Netanyahu previously made repeated allusions to the Holocaust while trying to galvanize the world against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Israeli leaders and the country\u2019s media also made such comparisons about Oct. 7, describing the Hamas attackers as Nazis, comparing their rampage to the historic violence inflicted on Eastern European Jews, and referring to the images of Jewish victims\u2019 burned bodies as a Shoah \u2014 the Hebrew word for Holocaust. Israelis have been jarred by the global rise in antisemitism, and many view the swell of criticism against Israel as part of the rise. They see hypocrisy in the world\u2019s intense focus on Israel\u2019s war with Hamas while other conflicts get much less attention. Moshe Klughaft, a former advisor to Netanyahu, said he believes the Israeli leader is genuinely concerned over rising antisemitism. \u201cIt is his duty to condemn antisemitism as prime minister of Israel and as head of a country that sees itself as responsible for world Jewry,\u201d he said. Many Israelis view the war in Gaza as a just act of self-defense and are befuddled by what many think should be criticism directed at Hamas \u2014 blaming the group for starting the war, using Palestinian civilians as human shields and refusing to free the hostages. The ICC warrant requests have likely bolstered such feelings. When Netanyahu leans on accusations of antisemitism, he is doing so with the Israeli public in mind, said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University. Hazan said Netanyahu has leveraged the campus protests, for example, to get Israelis to rally around him at a time when his public support has plummeted and Israelis are growing impatient with the war. He said Netanyahu has also used the protests as a scapegoat for his failure so far to achieve the war\u2019s two goals: destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. \u201cHe deflects blame from himself, attributing any shortcomings not to his foreign policies or policies in the (Palestinian) territories, but rather to antisemitism. This narrative benefits him greatly, absolving him of responsibility,\u201d Hazan said. Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem think thank, rejects the notion that Netanyahu stifles criticism by calling it antisemitic, pointing to just how much criticism the country receives.

Here\u2019s what each outcome could mean for the election", "text": "Julia Terruso | The Philadelphia Inquirer (TNS) Twelve jurors in New York City are poised to make history when they reveal the verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are slated for Tuesday with jury deliberations likely to start on Wednesday. Prosecutors have alleged that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee engaged in a strategy to acquire and suppress unfavorable news stories, to impact the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up the purported scheme. It\u2019s the first of Trump\u2019s four criminal cases to go to trial, and likely the only one to be tried before the Nov. 5 election. As the campaign barrels toward November, the hush money trial has done little to shift a tight race. That\u2019s partly because polling shows few voters are paying attention to it. In a recent YouGov/Yahoo News poll, just 16% of respondents said they\u2019d been following the trial \u201cvery closely,\u201d with one-third saying they were taking a mild interest in proceedings. More Americans said the trial made them feel \u201cbored\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d than interested. That\u2019s somewhat surprising given the salacious subject matter \u2014 a former adult film star detailing an alleged sexual encounter with a presidential candidate. But Trump has a long history of outrageous behavior, and if the facts of the case have not motivated voters en masse, a legal outcome of them might not either. \u201cI think even his most ardent supporters, given who he is, can believe everything they said he did,\u201d GOP consultant Chris Nicholas said. \u201cWhether it ends up being found to be felonious criminally is another story.\u201d Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching for in the three scenarios that could play out. If Donald Trump is found guilty If the jury finds Trump guilty, he would be eligible for a prison sentence, an unprecedented scenario that the Secret Service is already taking preemptive steps to prepare for. Each of the 34 felony falsification of business records charges that Trump is facing carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine. If Trump is found guilty, Judge Juan Merchan would have a lot of leeway. He could sentence Trump to probation, house arrest, or prison. Given Trump, 77, has no prior criminal record, many legal experts say it\u2019s unlikely the judge would impose a prison sentence. Trump would also likely appeal a guilty verdict, and any jail time would be stayed as the appeal continues through the court system, a process that could take months, if not years. Still, the case against Trump for Democrats and Biden becomes easier to make with a guilty verdict. The Biden campaign is preparing to start referring to Trump as \u201cconvicted felon Donald Trump,\u201d should he be found guilty. And polling has indicated a guilty verdict could erode some support. A March Politico and Ipsos survey found that a conviction could cost Trump more than one-third of independents. A February NBC News poll showed that a conviction in the New York trial could trigger a big swing from 18- to 34-year-old voters from Trump to Biden. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey from late April found that 20% of Trump supporters polled would \u201ceither reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%)\u201d if he\u2019s convicted. There\u2019s little sign that avid supporters have abandoned Trump over his legal troubles in states like Pennsylvania, but even smaller shifts could matter in a tight race. Trump, meanwhile, will likely continue to run \u2014 and fundraise \u2014 off of the trial, no matter the outcome. He\u2019s turned the indictments into unifying rallying calls to his supporters. \u201cEvery time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor,\u201d Trump said in his recent rally in Wildwood. \u201cI am being indicted for you and never forget our enemies want to take my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.\u201d If Donald Trump is acquitted As he did in Wildwood, Trump, for months, has categorized the case against him as a politically motivated prosecution. An acquittal would represent validation for Trump, his supporters, and his lineup of potential running mates, many of whom have packed the courtroom. While he faces three other criminal trials, it\u2019s unlikely any of those cases will conclude ahead of the general election, meaning an acquittal frees Trump from the possibility of running as a convicted candidate \u2014 or a candidate in jail. That could help him among undecided voters with whom the outcome of the cases carries some weight. Trump leads Biden in national polls and most swing states but in Pennsylvania his lead is narrow. His challenge has always been how to expand his base beyond a dedicated core. Running on an acquittal helps him make the case to moderates and independent voters. It puts Biden\u2019s Democratic surrogates in a more difficult position having spent months defending the trial against Trump. And while an acquittal wouldn\u2019t directly impact the other pending cases in Florida, Georgia, and Washington, it could shape public perception and influence potential juries in those states. If the jury hangs If the jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge will likely declare a mistrial. The Manhattan district attorney can then choose to retry the case with a new jury. But the runway to the election is shortening, making a retrial before November unlikely. Trump would likely cast a mistrial as a win. Whatever the outcome, how both candidates respond could carry almost as much weight as the decision. Biden has avoided commenting on the legal cases, but his campaign indicated he\u2019ll make a statement on the verdict. And Trump will be even more free to speak out with the trial behind him. \u201cThe wild card, of course, is how does he respond?\u201d Nicholas, the GOP consultant, said. \u201cOnce the verdict is in, he doesn\u2019t have the gag order anymore, so he\u2019s off to the races in terms of what he says.\u201d \u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.

Here\u2019s what each outcome could mean for the election", "text": "Julia Terruso | The Philadelphia Inquirer (TNS) Twelve jurors in New York City are poised to make history when they reveal the verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are slated for Tuesday with jury deliberations likely to start on Wednesday. Prosecutors have alleged that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee engaged in a strategy to acquire and suppress unfavorable news stories, to impact the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up the purported scheme. It\u2019s the first of Trump\u2019s four criminal cases to go to trial, and likely the only one to be tried before the Nov. 5 election. As the campaign barrels toward November, the hush money trial has done little to shift a tight race. That\u2019s partly because polling shows few voters are paying attention to it. In a recent YouGov/Yahoo News poll, just 16% of respondents said they\u2019d been following the trial \u201cvery closely,\u201d with one-third saying they were taking a mild interest in proceedings. More Americans said the trial made them feel \u201cbored\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d than interested. That\u2019s somewhat surprising given the salacious subject matter \u2014 a former adult film star detailing an alleged sexual encounter with a presidential candidate. But Trump has a long history of outrageous behavior, and if the facts of the case have not motivated voters en masse, a legal outcome of them might not either. \u201cI think even his most ardent supporters, given who he is, can believe everything they said he did,\u201d GOP consultant Chris Nicholas said. \u201cWhether it ends up being found to be felonious criminally is another story.\u201d Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching for in the three scenarios that could play out. If Donald Trump is found guilty If the jury finds Trump guilty, he would be eligible for a prison sentence, an unprecedented scenario that the Secret Service is already taking preemptive steps to prepare for. Each of the 34 felony falsification of business records charges that Trump is facing carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine. If Trump is found guilty, Judge Juan Merchan would have a lot of leeway. He could sentence Trump to probation, house arrest, or prison. Given Trump, 77, has no prior criminal record, many legal experts say it\u2019s unlikely the judge would impose a prison sentence. Trump would also likely appeal a guilty verdict, and any jail time would be stayed as the appeal continues through the court system, a process that could take months, if not years.

Here\u2019s what each outcome could mean for the election", "text": "Julia Terruso | The Philadelphia Inquirer (TNS) Twelve jurors in New York City are poised to make history when they reveal the verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are slated for Tuesday with jury deliberations likely to start on Wednesday. Prosecutors have alleged that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee engaged in a strategy to acquire and suppress unfavorable news stories, to impact the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up the purported scheme. It\u2019s the first of Trump\u2019s four criminal cases to go to trial, and likely the only one to be tried before the Nov. 5 election. As the campaign barrels toward November, the hush money trial has done little to shift a tight race. That\u2019s partly because polling shows few voters are paying attention to it. In a recent YouGov/Yahoo News poll, just 16% of respondents said they\u2019d been following the trial \u201cvery closely,\u201d with one-third saying they were taking a mild interest in proceedings. More Americans said the trial made them feel \u201cbored\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d than interested. That\u2019s somewhat surprising given the salacious subject matter \u2014 a former adult film star detailing an alleged sexual encounter with a presidential candidate. But Trump has a long history of outrageous behavior, and if the facts of the case have not motivated voters en masse, a legal outcome of them might not either. \u201cI think even his most ardent supporters, given who he is, can believe everything they said he did,\u201d GOP consultant Chris Nicholas said. \u201cWhether it ends up being found to be felonious criminally is another story.\u201d Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching for in the three scenarios that could play out. If Donald Trump is found guilty If the jury finds Trump guilty, he would be eligible for a prison sentence, an unprecedented scenario that the Secret Service is already taking preemptive steps to prepare for. Each of the 34 felony falsification of business records charges that Trump is facing carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine. If Trump is found guilty, Judge Juan Merchan would have a lot of leeway. He could sentence Trump to probation, house arrest, or prison. Given Trump, 77, has no prior criminal record, many legal experts say it\u2019s unlikely the judge would impose a prison sentence. Trump would also likely appeal a guilty verdict, and any jail time would be stayed as the appeal continues through the court system, a process that could take months, if not years. Still, the case against Trump for Democrats and Biden becomes easier to make with a guilty verdict. The Biden campaign is preparing to start referring to Trump as \u201cconvicted felon Donald Trump,\u201d should he be found guilty. And polling has indicated a guilty verdict could erode some support. A March Politico and Ipsos survey found that a conviction could cost Trump more than one-third of independents. A February NBC News poll showed that a conviction in the New York trial could trigger a big swing from 18- to 34-year-old voters from Trump to Biden. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey from late April found that 20% of Trump supporters polled would \u201ceither reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%)\u201d if he\u2019s convicted. There\u2019s little sign that avid supporters have abandoned Trump over his legal troubles in states like Pennsylvania, but even smaller shifts could matter in a tight race. Trump, meanwhile, will likely continue to run \u2014 and fundraise \u2014 off of the trial, no matter the outcome. He\u2019s turned the indictments into unifying rallying calls to his supporters. \u201cEvery time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor,\u201d Trump said in his recent rally in Wildwood. \u201cI am being indicted for you and never forget our enemies want to take my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.\u201d If Donald Trump is acquitted As he did in Wildwood, Trump, for months, has categorized the case against him as a politically motivated prosecution. An acquittal would represent validation for Trump, his supporters, and his lineup of potential running mates, many of whom have packed the courtroom. While he faces three other criminal trials, it\u2019s unlikely any of those cases will conclude ahead of the general election, meaning an acquittal frees Trump from the possibility of running as a convicted candidate \u2014 or a candidate in jail. That could help him among undecided voters with whom the outcome of the cases carries some weight. Trump leads Biden in national polls and most swing states but in Pennsylvania his lead is narrow. His challenge has always been how to expand his base beyond a dedicated core. Running on an acquittal helps him make the case to moderates and independent voters. It puts Biden\u2019s Democratic surrogates in a more difficult position having spent months defending the trial against Trump. And while an acquittal wouldn\u2019t directly impact the other pending cases in Florida, Georgia, and Washington, it could shape public perception and influence potential juries in those states. If the jury hangs If the jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge will likely declare a mistrial. The Manhattan district attorney can then choose to retry the case with a new jury. But the runway to the election is shortening, making a retrial before November unlikely. Trump would likely cast a mistrial as a win.

The long-awaited move comes as gangs continue to terrorize the capital of Port-au-Prince, opening fire in once peaceful neighborhoods and using heavy machinery to demolish several police stations and prisons. Council member Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles told The Associated Press that six out of seven council members with voting power chose Conille earlier Tuesday. He said one member, Laurent St. Cyr, was not in Haiti and therefore did not vote. Conille is UNICEF\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean and previously served as Haiti\u2019s prime minister from October 2011 to May 2012 under then President Michel Martelly. He replaces Michel Patrick Boisvert, who was named interim prime minister after Ariel Henry resigned via letter in late April. Henry was on an official trip to Kenya when a coalition of powerful gangs launched coordinated attacks Feb. 29, seizing control of police stations, shooting at Haiti\u2019s main international airport and storming the country\u2019s two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. Henry was locked out of the country by the attacks, with the airport in the Port-au-Prince capital remaining shuttered for nearly three months. Gang violence is still surging in parts of Haiti\u2019s capital and beyond as Conille takes over the helm of the troubled Caribbean country awaiting the UN-backed deployment of a police force from Kenya and other countries. Conille studied political and health administration and helped develop health care in impoverished communities in Haiti. He worked for several years at the United Nations before Martelly designated him as prime minister in 2011. Conille resigned less than a year later following clashes with the president and his Cabinet over an investigation into government officials who have dual nationality, which is not allowed by Haiti\u2019s constitution. Conille has an arduous task ahead of him, having to quell rampant gang violence while helping lift Haiti out of deep poverty, with inflation reaching a record 29%, according to the latest data available. In recent years, gangs that control at least 80% of Port-au-Prince have forced more than 360,000 people from their homes, and they continue to control key routes from the capital to Haiti\u2019s northern and southern regions, often paralyzing the transportation of critical goods. The selection of Conille as prime minister comes just weeks after former Haitian sports minister Fritz B\u00e9lizaire was chosen for the post in late April by a four-member coalition within the nine-member transitional council in a surprise announcement that angered many. Critics said proper procedure was not followed as dictated by the framework that established the council, so a new process was started to choose a prime minister, with dozens of names submitted for the post. The drawn-out process has been criticized by many, including the Montana Accord, a Haitian civil society group that has a representative on the council. In a statement Tuesday, the group accused the council of not taking any \u201cconsequential measures\u201d since being installed as \u201cthe suffering of the people is getting worse, while the gangs are taking control of more territory and committing more crimes.\u201d It also accused the council of not being transparent while choosing a new prime minister, saying it did not publicly share the criteria used or the names submitted, among other things. Lin\u00e9 Balthazar, president of the Tet Kale party, called on the council to be transparent in an interview Monday with Magik9, a local radio station, and said the selection of a prime minister appeared improvised. In addition to selecting a new prime minister, the nine-member council, of which seven have voting powers, also has to appoint a provisional electoral commission, a requirement before elections can take place. The council\u2019s non-renewable mandate expires Feb. 7, 2026, at which date a new president is scheduled to be sworn in.

Conille has an arduous task ahead of him, having to quell rampant gang violence while helping lift Haiti out of deep poverty, with inflation reaching a record 29%, according to the latest data available. In recent years, gangs that control at least 80% of Port-au-Prince have forced more than 360,000 people from their homes, and they continue to control key routes from the capital to Haiti\u2019s northern and southern regions, often paralyzing the transportation of critical goods. The selection of Conille as prime minister comes just weeks after former Haitian sports minister Fritz B\u00e9lizaire was chosen for the post in late April by a four-member coalition within the nine-member transitional council in a surprise announcement that angered many. Critics said proper procedure was not followed as dictated by the framework that established the council, so a new process was started to choose a prime minister, with dozens of names submitted for the post. The drawn-out process has been criticized by many, including the Montana Accord, a Haitian civil society group that has a representative on the council. In a statement Tuesday, the group accused the council of not taking any \u201cconsequential measures\u201d since being installed as \u201cthe suffering of the people is getting worse, while the gangs are taking control of more territory and committing more crimes.\u201d It also accused the council of not being transparent while choosing a new prime minister, saying it did not publicly share the criteria used or the names submitted, among other things. Lin\u00e9 Balthazar, president of the Tet Kale party, called on the council to be transparent in an interview Monday with Magik9, a local radio station, and said the selection of a prime minister appeared improvised. In addition to selecting a new prime minister, the nine-member council, of which seven have voting powers, also has to appoint a provisional electoral commission, a requirement before elections can take place. The council\u2019s non-renewable mandate expires Feb. 7, 2026, at which date a new president is scheduled to be sworn in. In addition to picking a new prime minister, the council also is responsible for selecting a new Cabinet and holding general elections by the end of next year. The council members are Emmanuel Vertilaire for Petit Desalin, a party led by former senator and presidential candidate Jean-Charles Mo\u00efse; Smith Augustin for EDE/RED, a party led by former Prime Minister Claude Joseph; Fritz Alphonse Jean of the Montana Accord; Leslie Voltaire for Fanmi Lavalas, the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles for the Dec. 21 coalition that backs former Prime Minister Ariel Henry; Edgard Leblanc Fils for the Jan. 30 Collective, which represents parties including that of former President Michel Martelly; and Laurent Saint-Cyr for the private sector.

Conille was chosen by consensus after the council conducted hearings of candidates, Leblanc Fils said. Conille briefly served as prime minister from 2011 to 2012 during the presidency of Michel Martelly. He is currently the UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. His appointment is a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s government, following the ouster of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry earlier this year. The new prime minister and the nine-member council must also select a cabinet and eventually lead Haiti to new elections. Since February, attacks by an insurgent alliance of gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince mean the city\u2019s international airport and seaport have ceased to function, breaking vital supply lines of food and aid and triggering an exodus of evacuation flights for foreign nationals. The violence erupted while Henry was in Kenya to secure its commitment to a multinational security mission meant to bolster Haiti\u2019s national police. But the then-leader was unable to return to the country amid the bloodshed, and ultimately announced his resignation in March. The resignation pitched the country\u2019s political establishment into weeks of negotiations as they sought to muster a transitional government. The inauguration of the CARICOM-backed presidential council in April has since allowed Haiti to resume planning for the much-delayed foreign mission. That foreign mission, led by Kenya, is now expected to arrive sometime in June. While some commercial flights to Port-au-Prince have tentatively restarted, the city remains largely cut off from the outside world. Across the nation, nearly 5 million people in Haiti are suffering from acute food insecurity \u2013 defined as when a person\u2019s inability to consume adequate food poses immediate danger to their life or livelihood.

The Irishman Year: 2019 Cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci Genre: Biography, Crime Rating: R Runtime: 209 minutes Director: Martin Scorsese Trailer: Watch here Martin Scorsese delivers another cinematic triumph, this time for Netflix and with the help of some familiar faces. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino team up (again) for this crime drama based on actual events. De Niro plays Frank Sheeran a World War II vet who finds work as a hitman for the mob. Pacino plays notorious Teamster Jimmy Hoffa, a man who frequently found himself on the wrong side of the law and the criminals he worked with. The film charts the pair\u2019s partnership over the years while injecting some historical milestones for context. It\u2019s heavy and impressively cast and everything you\u2019d expect a Scorsese passion project to be, with some interesting de-aging CGI that does its best to show the scope of Scorsese\u2019s storytelling. 16. If Beale Street Could Talk Year: 2018 Cast: KiKi Layne, Regina King, Stephan James Genre: Drama, Romance Rating: R Runtime: 119 minutes Director: Barry Jenkins Trailer: Watch here Barry Jenkins excels at bringing the Black experience to the big screen with an authenticity that is rarely matched by his fellow filmmakers. He did it with Moonlight, and he does it here with this adaptation of a piece from James Baldwin\u2019s iconography. Told in a nonlinear style, the film recounts the romance of Tish and Fonny, two young Black lovers living in 1970s New York. When Fonny is accused of a heinous crime, Tish and her family fight to prove his innocence. The film stars KiKi Layne, Stephan James, Regina King, and more. All in all, the story is heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time, and King puts in an Oscar-winning performance as Tish\u2019s devoted mother.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/glass-onion-top.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"Glass Onion Knives Out 2\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/glass-onion-top.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/glass-onion-top.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/glass-onion-top.jpg?resize=704,309 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/glass-onion-top.jpg?resize=768,338 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Netflix</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tOur list of the best movies on Netflix includes 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,' 'They Cloned Tyrone' 'Titanic,' and more.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/movies/best-movies-on-netflix/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/glass-onion-feat.jpg?w=710", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 17:20:00", "author": "Jessica Toomer", "authors": ["Jessica Toomer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.727}, {"id": 225158004, "title": "The 50 Best Shows On Netflix Right Now (June 2024)", "text": "3.

When Walter White is diagnosed with cancer, he turns to a life of drug manufacturing to help pay for treatment and begins to build a gigantic meth empire. While it might not have the same jokes and snazzy suits as Better Call Saul, its predecessor helped set up the intricate Breaking Bad world in all its stressful glory.

She was broke, cheating with her friend\u2019s husband, and then she was drawn like a moth to the flame of a vague audition. A last chance. If she\u2019d known what it was for, she probably wouldn\u2019t have gone because it was for a rinky dink wrestling show angling for an F- grade from OSHA. Inspired by the real-world creation of Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, this show gave a safe place to a dozen weirdos all looking for a tribe. And health work-life balance. Sometimes you only get to pick one. It\u2019s hilarious and heartfelt, unleashing the intense pressure these women are under as kinetic energy in the ring. Plus, any show with a Rocky IV-esque robot with drugs inside it is an automatic winner. 11.

French authorities also carried out a search of the employee\u2019s European parliament office in Strasbourg at the request of the Belgian examining magistrate overseeing the inquiry into corruption and Russian interference. The case is part of a Belgian investigation announced last month into alleged payments to MEPs to promote Russian propaganda on the Voice of Europe website. The searches come just over a week before elections to the European parliament. After a Czech investigation into the Prague-based website, Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said last month a pro-Russian interference network was active in several European countries, including Belgium. The objective, he added, was to help elect more pro-Russian candidates to the European parliament in next week\u2019s elections and reinforce \u201ca certain pro-Russian narrative in that institution\u201d. In a statement on Wednesday, Belgium\u2019s federal public prosecutor\u2019s office said the searches were part of \u201ca case of interference, passive corruption and membership of a criminal organisation and relates to indications of Russian interference\u201d. A spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office declined to name the suspect, citing the standard practice of secrecy. Citing sources close to the inquiry, Belgian media named the suspect as Guillaume Pradoura, who they said was the former assistant of Maximilian Krah, the lead candidate for Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party who recently resigned from the far-right party\u2019s leadership over comments about the SS. He has also been accused of accepting payments for interviews on Voice of Europe, allegations he strongly denies. One of his assistants, Jian Guo, has also been arrested over suspected espionage for China. Pradoura is listed as working for Marcel de Graaff, a Dutch MEP for the far-right Forum for Democracy party. Pradoura and de Graaff did not immediately respond to a request by the Guardian for comment. But in a post on X, de Graaff said he learned of the searches through the media, adding: \u201cI spoke to my employee and he appeared not to be aware of this. The authorities have not contacted me or him. To me this all comes as a complete surprise.\u201d De Graaff added that he personally had no involvement \u201cin any so-called Russian disinformation operation\u201d. Krah has been contacted for comment. After an earlier decision to ban the Voice of Europe from broadcasting, the EU on Monday imposed sanctions on the website, which it said had \u201cengaged in a systematic, international campaign of media manipulation and distortion of facts to destabilise Ukraine, the EU and its member states\u201d. Asset freezes and travel bans were also imposed on two businessmen connected to the site, Artem Marchevskyand Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk led a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine for years. One senior central European official told the Guardian the Russians were \u201cdefinitely increas[ing] pressure on many fronts\u201d before the European elections. The Voice of Europe was \u201ca kind of instrument through which they have leveraged the influence\u201d, the official said, noting that the operation was \u201csophisticated\u201d and different from usual forms of disinformation. Voice of Europe was used to \u201corganise meetings, or conferences or workshops. So this is quite an elaborate scheme. And it\u2019s not classical disinformation,\u201d the person said. Russia\u2019s goal with these kinds of operations, the official said, was to divide and weaken Europe: \u201cThey need to break the unity around Ukraine, I think that\u2019s something which they are really focused on. \u201cI think their overall goal is basically to split the EU, to create a mess \u2026 because in the mess you can always further your interest more easily.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Parliamentary staffer may have played \u2018significant role\u2019 in alleged payments to MEPs to promote propaganda on Voice of Europe website</p><p>Belgian police have searched the European parliament office and Brussels home of a parliamentary staffer who is believed to have played \u201ca significant role\u201d in a Russian interference operation, the national prosecutor has said.</p><p>French authorities also carried out a search of the employee\u2019s European parliament office in Strasbourg at the request of the Belgian examining magistrate overseeing the inquiry into corruption and Russian interference.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/belgian-police-search-eu-parliament-office-russian-interference\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/belgian-police-search-eu-parliament-office-russian-interference", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635e8a2bb8df039669db5470bcdcd1df36e0ac38/737_837_7124_4274/master/7124.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZ", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:57:17", "author": "Jennifer Rankin,Lili Bayer", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin", "Lili Bayer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.051}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225051462, "title": "Another US military MQ-9 Reaper drone goes down in Yemen, images purportedly show", "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Another U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drone went down in Yemen, images online purported to show Wednesday, as Yemen's Houthi rebels continued attacks on shipping around the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war.

The attorney-general has decided to indict Thaksin on all charges, spokesperson Prayuth Bejraguna told reporters. Thaksin was absent from today\u2019s hearing due to a COVID-19 infection, but will need to appear before court on June 18 to be formally indicted, Prayuth added. The lese-majeste complaint was filed by royalist activists in 2016, relating to an interview that Thaksin gave the year before to South Korea\u2019s Chosun Ilbo newspaper, in which he alleged that the Privy Council had backed the May 2014 coup which ousted his sister Yingluck Shinawatra\u2019s government. Perceived criticisms of the Thai monarchy are harshly punished under Article 112 of Thailand\u2019s penal code, also known as the lese-majeste law, which carries prison sentences of up to 15 years \u2013 and which government critics claim has been routinely used to hush up dissenting voices. As Reuters notes, Thaksin\u2019s case will be the highest-profile case among more than 270-odd Article 112 prosecutions working their way through the Thai legal system. Just this week, two separate Thai courts sentenced an opposition parliamentarian and an activist musician to prison terms for insulting the monarchy. Thaksin also faces a charge under the Computer Crime Act. In a country where judges routinely bend with the political winds, the attorney-general\u2019s decision to press ahead with the lese-majeste charge points to possible cracks in the political compact that has led to Thaksin\u2019s political rehabilitation and comeback over the past nine months. Last August, Thaksin returned from a long period of self-exile to begin serving a prison term for abuse of power dating back to his time in office. After the rapid dilution of his eight-year sentence, he was released on parole in February. The former leader\u2019s rehabilitation reflected a sudden d\u00e9tente in the two-decade-long political war between Thailand\u2019s conservative establishment, clustered around the monarchy and armed forces, and Thaksin\u2019s populist political machine, which carried his parties to victory in every election between 2001 and 2019. This was made possible by the political realignment in that followed last year\u2019s general election, which saw Pheu Thai eclipsed by a more progressive challenger, the Move Forward Party (MFP), which won the most seats of any party. In the complex political maneuverings that followed the election, the MFP was sidelined as Pheu Thai joined with a coalition of conservative and military-backed parties and formed a government under Srettha Thavisin. The former real estate developer was on confirmed as PM the very same day that Thaksin landed at Bangkok\u2019s Don Meuang airport. Under the terms of this grand political compact, Thaksin\u2019s ended up serving barely six months of his eight-year prison sentence, all of it in a relatively plush private suite at a prison hospital. (This former public enemy number one did not spend a single night in prison proper.) Conversely, the fact that attorney general has now decided to charge him under Article 112 suggests that this political compact between Pheu Thai and the establishment is fraying, even if it hasn\u2019t yet come apart entirely. Thaksin has arguably not done his own cause any good. Since being paroled in February, the 74-year-old former leader has almost contemptuously asserted his influence over Thai politics. As The Diplomat\u2019s Bangkok-based columnist Tita Sanglee noted earlier this month, Thaksin has \u201cwasted no time traveling to major provinces in Thailand\u2019s north and south. He was seen visiting development sites and mingling with political bigwigs, high-ranking local officials, and businesspeople, effectively flaunting his regained influence.\u201d He also made an apparently stillborn attempt to establish himself as a mediator in the conflict in Myanmar, and is believed to have influenced a disruptive cabinet reshuffle earlier this month. It is possible that the tribunes of the military-royalist establishment, including the Palace, have been angered by Thaksin\u2019s rapid return to active politics and are sending the message that he should limit his ambitions. It is also possible that many royalists were never quite able to get over years of cultivated bitterness toward Thaksin and his allies. Whether or not this marks a resumption of the war between the Shinawatras and the establishment remains to be seen \u2013 but the course of the lese-majeste case against Thaksin will likely offer a strong indication of whether the current pact will survive beyond the short term.", "summary": "The pact between Thaksin's camp and the royalist establishment, which allowed the former leader to return from self-exile last year, may be starting to fray.", "url": "https://thediplomat.com/2024/05/former-thai-pm-thaksin-to-be-charged-with-royal-defamation/", "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2024-02-20-004834.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 07:22:10", "author": "Sebastian Strangio", "authors": ["Sebastian Strangio"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.026}, {"id": 224988048, "title": "Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to be indicted for royal defamation", "text": "Thai prosecutors said Wednesday former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra will be indicted for defaming the monarchy, three months after he was freed on parole on other charges.

THAILAND'S FORMER PRIME MINISTER THAKSIN SHINAWATRA TO BE RELEASED AFTER BEING GRANTED PAROLE The law on defaming the monarchy, an offense known as lese majeste, is punishable by three to 15 years in prison. It is controversial not only because critics consider it harsh, but also because they charge it is used for political purposes to punish government critics. Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006. His opponents then had accused him of disrespecting King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. Thaksin's ouster set off years of struggle between his supporters and his opponents, who were generally staunch royalists. The political polarization led to unprecedented public debate about the monarchy's role, which sharpened when student-led protests for greater democracy took the the streets in 2020. Thaksin had been in self-imposed exile since 2008, but returned to Thailand in August last year to begin serving an eight-year sentence on charges related to corruption and abuse of power. He was released on parole in February from the hospital in Bangkok where he spent six months serving time for corruption-related offenses. On his return, he was moved almost immediately from prison to the hospital on grounds of ill health, and about a week after that King Maha Vajiralongkorn reduced his sentence to a single year. Thaksin was granted parole because of his age \u2014 he is 74 \u2014 and ill health, leaving him free for the remainder of his one-year sentence. THAILAND'S FORMER PRIME MINISTER THAKSIN SHINAWATRA RELEASED ON PAROLE FOR CORRUPTION-RELATED OFFENSES Thaksin's return was interpreted as part of a political bargain between the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of parties that he has supported, and their longstanding rivals in the conservative establishment to stop the progressive Move Forward Party from forming a government after its victory in last year\u2019s general election. But shortly after his return, the attorney general\u2019s office said it had revived an investigation into whether Thaksin almost nine years ago violated the law against defaming the monarch. Thaksin was originally charged in 2016 with violating the law for remarks he made to journalists when he was in Seoul, South Korea, a year before that, but the investigation could proceed only after he was presented with the charge in person in the hospital in January, officials said. Thaksin had denied the charges and submitted a statement defending himself. Prosecutor\u2019s spokesperson Prayuth said there is enough evidence for the attorney general to indict Thaksin. He said the prosecutors have already prepared their statement and documents to present to the court next month. Thaksin's lawyer Winyat Chatmontree said he is confident he has a strong defense for his client. \"We have been working on this for several months, since we submitted the statement of defense,\" he told The Associated Press. \"But whether we will win the case, it's up to the court's discretion based on the evidence.\" Winyat also noted that the video of Thaksin's comments that investigators used as evidence might have been manipulated. Since his release, Thaksin has maintained a high profile and is believed to be wielding influence in the government led by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. He has traveled the country making public appearances and was reportedly involved in an attempt to broker peace talks for neighboring war-torn Burma. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One analyst believes Thaksin's growing influence has angered the ultra-conservatives and that the indictment is their response. \"It is designed to keep Thaksin under control. This is keeping him on a leash. If he doesn\u2019t behave then this charge can be activated and could land him in jail. This is to curtail his movement and his maneuvers and to remind him, sending him a signal in a way, to know who\u2019s in charge and to know he should not overstep the boundary,\" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, at professor at Bangkok\u2019s Chulalongkorn University. The lese majeste law came under the spotlight again earlier this month when 28-year-old activist Netiporn \"Bung\" Sanesangkhom died in a prison hospital after going who went on a hunger strike. She had been jailed on a lese majeste charge. The death sparked fresh calls for reviewing the judicial process that allows political offenders accused of nonviolent offenses to be denied bail and be held for extended periods in prison ahead of being tried. Netiporn had been accused of conducting polls in public spaces in 2022 asking people\u2019s opinions about the royal family.", "summary": "Thailand&apos;s former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is set to be indicted for defaming the monarchy.

Another image showed what appeared to be a collapsed balloon with garbage strewn around it. By Wednesday, more than 150 balloons had been detected, according to the Yonhap news agency. Some had landed on the ground, while others were still in the air, it added, citing a South Korean military source. Some of the balloons had travelled long distances, reaching as far as the south-eastern province of South Gyeongsang, it said. The fallen balloons appeared to have been carrying various items of rubbish, including plastic bottles, batteries, shoe parts and what is believed to be manure, an official of the joint chiefs of staff (JCS) said. The military said unidentified objects believed to be from North Korea had been spotted near the demilitarised zone \u2013 the heavily fortified border separating the two Koreas. It urged people not to go near them and to report sightings to the military or police. \u201cThese acts by North Korea clearly violate international law and seriously threaten our people\u2019s safety,\u201d the JCS said, according to Yonhap. \u201c[We] sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop these inhumane and vulgar acts.\u201d The balloons arrived after Kim Kang-il, a North Korean defence vice-minister, warned that the regime would retaliate in response to anti-North Korean leaflets flown across the border in the opposite direction. \u201cTit-for-tat action will be also taken against frequent scattering of leaflets and other rubbish [by South Korea] near border areas,\u201d Kim said in a statement on Sunday carried by the official KCNA news agency. \u201cMounds of wastepaper and filth will soon be scattered over the border areas and the interior of the ROK and it will directly experience how much effort is required to remove them,\u201d Kim added, referring to the South\u2019s official name, the Republic of Korea. For years, South Korean activists and North Korean defectors have sent balloons to North Korea carrying leaflets criticising the regime and urging North Koreans to rise up against the Kim dynasty that has ruled the country for decades. They have also sent USB memory sticks of K-pop music videos, which are banned in the North. Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said sending balloons was far less risky than taking overt military action. \u201cThese kinds of grey zone tactics are more difficult to counter and hold less risk of uncontrollable military escalation, even if they\u2019re horrid for the civilians who are ultimately targeted,\u201d he said. The use of propaganda balloons has long been a source of tension between North Korea and South Korea, which are technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice agreement but not a peace treaty.", "summary": "<p>South Korea has warned residents to be alert after media reports that more than 90 balloons carrying various objects have been detected</p><p>South Korea has warned residents living near the border with North Korea to be on alert, after media reported that the regime had sent balloons containing what appeared to be rubbish and faeces into its neighbour\u2019s territory.</p><p>Photographs published in South Korean media showed an inflated white balloon with a plastic bag tethered to it.

As of 4 p.m. local time, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it had detected more than 260 balloons dropped since late Tuesday night into various parts of the country. The balloons that landed were being collected by a chemical, biological and nuclear rapid response team and an explosive ordnance team, the JCS said in a statement sent to reporters. \"North Korea's actions blatantly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,\" the statement said. \"These North Korean balloons can fall not only in residential areas but also at airports and highways, potentially causing damage.\" The balloons appeared to carry items of trash as well as manure, the JCS said. Images shared by the military and users on social media showed large white balloons carrying bags attached by string. Spilled contents on sidewalks and roads included pieces of plastic, batteries, toilet paper and dark soil. Authorities were also investigating whether there were any North Korean propaganda leaflets in the balloons. The launch came days after a North Korean official warned of \"tit-for-tat action\" against South Korean activists floating balloons filled with leaflets and USB drives over the border. The South has been conducting \"despicable psychological warfare by scattering leaflets and various dirty things near border areas of the DPRK,\" Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il said in a statement issued on Sunday. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea. \"Mounds of wastepaper and filth will soon be scattered over the border areas and the interior of the ROK and it will directly experience how much effort is required to remove them,\" Kim said, using the South's official name of the Republic of Korea. North Korea has reacted with fury in the past to defector-led activist groups sending balloons across the border. In June 2020, Pyongyang severed all communications with Seoul and blew up an inter-Korean liaison office over what it called South Korea's failure to rein in the defectors. In a separate statement, a JCS official said that the South's military also detected North Korean attempts to jam GPS signals near the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea early Wednesday morning. The jamming attempt caused no damage, the official said. The actions come as tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain at their highest point in years amid weapons tests and heated rhetoric from the North. On Monday night, Pyongyang attempted to place its second spy satellite into orbit but failed when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5171716981851/2024/i/17169865796836/v1.5/North-Korea-floats-trash-and-manure-filled-balloons-into-South-Korea.jpg\"> North Korea has launched hundreds of balloons carrying trash and excrement across the border into South Korea, Seoul's military said Wednesday, in apparent retaliation for activists floating propaganda leaflets.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2024/05/29/North-Korea-balloons-border-trash-manure-JCS-propagand/5171716981851/", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5171716981851/2024/i/17169865796836/v1.2/North-Korea-floats-trash-and-manure-filled-balloons-into-South-Korea.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:22:29", "author": "Thomas Maresca", "authors": ["Thomas Maresca"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.276}, {"id": 225036740, "title": "North Korea accused of sending balloons of trash, poop into the South", "text": "South Korea has accused the North Korean regime of sending balloons containing garbage and animal feces into its territory. Over 260 inflated balloons with plastic bags tied to them had been detected by Wednesday, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Some of the inflatables landed on the ground, while others were still airborne. Those that had landed appeared to have trash strewn around them, as well as animal excrement the Yonhap news agency said. South Korea\u2019s military explosives ordnance unit and a chemical and biological warfare response team were deployed to inspect and collect the mysterious objects. An alert was also issued warning residents to keep away from the balloons and to report any sightings to the authorities. North Korea may be trying to provoke the South, but an official with the presidential office in Seoul vowed to respond calmly. \u201cBy putting rubbish and miscellaneous objects into balloons, they seem to want to test how our people would react and whether our government is indeed disrupted, and apart from direct provocations, how psychological warfare and small-scale complex threats would play out in our country,\u201d the official told reporters. Balloons have regularly been flown the other way by South Korean activists, including those who defected from the North. Pyongyang has reacted angrily to those balloons, which contain materials like anti-regime leaflets, mini radios, food, and USB sticks of K-pop music videos and television shows. On Sunday, North Korea\u2019s vice defense minister denounced the South Korean balloons as \u201cdirty things\u201d and threatened to send \u201cmounds of dirty waste paper and filth\u201d into the South in retaliation. North Korea also tried to jam the GPS signals in South Korea early Wednesday, though no damage was reported. Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said that sending the balloons is a less dangerous means of provocation than direct military action. \u201cThese kinds of gray zone tactics are more difficult to counter and hold less risk of uncontrollable military escalation, even if they\u2019re horrid for the civilians who are ultimately targeted,\u201d he explained.

Weinstein was convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on Jessica Mann, an aspiring actor, and of sexually assaulting Miriam Haley, a former TV and film production assistant.

The court heard testimonies from multiple women which detailed years of abuse.In February 2020 he was found guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape and faced up to 25 years in prison. In March that year he was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Weinstein's lawyers appealed for leniency on account of his age and health, but the judge was not moved.In 2023, Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the 2013 rape of an actress in Los Angeles. That sentence was to run consecutively with his prior 23-year sentence.Since 2015, Weinstein has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct accusations from actresses Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie.The high-profile accusations led to the #MeToo movement gaining global prominence in 2017, following a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano encouraging women to use the hashtag to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault.Weinstein appeared in court earlier in May, sitting in a wheelchair in what was his first public appearance since the overturning of his rape conviction. Weinstein was also recently admitted to hospital; he suffers with diabetes and cardiac issues.The court Weinstein is set to make an appearance in on Wednesday has been hosting former President Donald Trump's hush-money trial. Closing arguments were recently heard from both sides of the case.Trump's case saw a string of high-profile witnesses, including adult-film star Stormy Daniels and former fixer for Trump Michael Cohen give testimony relating to payments made to Daniels to keep an alleged affair with the former president under wraps, because it would harm his 2016 election chances.Do you have a story we should be covering?

Weinstein is awaiting a retrial on rape charges after his 2020 conviction was tossed out. Wednesday\u2019s court hearing will address various legal issues related to the upcoming trial, which is tentatively scheduled for some time after Labor Day. Weinstein\u2019s original trial was held in the same courtroom where Trump is on trial now, but the two men are unlikely to bump into each other. Weinstein is in custody and will be brought to and from the courtroom under guard. He will be appearing in a courtroom on a different floor from the one where Trump is currently on trial. Weinstein was convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on Jessica Mann, an aspiring actor, and of sexually assaulting Miriam Haley, a former TV and film production assistant. But last month New York\u2019s highest court threw out those convictions after determining that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Weinstein, 72, has maintained that any sexual activity was consensual. The New York ruling reopened a painful chapter in America\u2019s reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures. The #MeToo era began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein. Last week, prosecutors asked Judge Curtis Farber to remind Weinstein\u2019s lawyers not to discuss or disparage potential witnesses in public ahead of the retrial.

Black players were barred from MLB until Jackie Robinson broke the league's color barrier in 1947 when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. That breakthrough ultimately led to the Negro Leagues ending play in 1960. \"Their accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson's 1947 Dodger debut,\" Manfred said in his statement. In 2020, in the wake of America's reckoning with racial injustice following the murder of George Floyd, MLB announced that it was \"elevating\" seven Negro Leagues that operated from 1920 to 1948 to \"major league\" status, a move which, at the time, meant approximately 3,400 players in those Negro Leagues could be recognized by MLB for their on-field achievements. Wednesday's announcement, however, will take that a step further. The immediate impact of the incorporation will see Josh Gibson, one of baseball's greatest players, take multiple records from the likes of Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth, per CBS Sports. Gibson will become the all-time leader in career batting average at .372, passing Cobb's mark of .366, according to CBS Sports. His career .718 slugging percentage will also be the all-time high mark now, surpassing Ruth's previous record of .690, and he'll be the leader in career OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage) with 1.177, passing Ruth's mark of 1.164.\"When you hear Josh Gibson's name now, it's not just that he was the greatest player in the Negro Leagues, but one of the greatest of all time,\" Sean Gibson, Gibson's great-grandson, told USA Today in a statement Tuesday. \"These aren't just Negro League stats. They're major-league baseball stats.\" In 2020, MLB acknowledged that it was seeking to rectify a 1969 decision by the Special Committee on Baseball Records \u2014 a group that was formed to determine which leagues would be recognized as \"major leagues.\" That 1969 committee recognized six such \"major leagues\" dating back to 1876, but omitted all Negro Leagues from consideration. \"It is MLB's view that the committee's 1969 omission of the Negro Leagues from consideration was clearly an error that demands today's designation,\" the league said in 2020. The late Hank Aaron played in the Negro Leagues before entering MLB and eventually breaking Ruth's career home run record. In the 2023 documentary \"The League,\" he described the challenges Negro League players faced. \"We got one dollar a day meal money, and we would buy one loaf of bread and we would buy a big jar of peanut butter,\" Aaron said. \"That's what we lived off of for three or four days.\"\u2014 Zoe Christen Jones and Jericka Duncan contributed to this report.", "summary": "The immediate impact of the incorporation will see Josh Gibson, one of the baseball's greatest players, take multiple records from the likes of Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/negro-leagues-statistics-integrated-mlb-record-books-josh-gibson/", "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/29/b2dee509-e4ac-4eca-91b3-e308874c1ec0/thumbnail/1200x630/e3cfc2c16e17b314a98e615f0b7c77ef/gettyimages-514700378.jpg?v=c5044be0004eac09882c007ac02fef6d", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/05/22/2339782723516/2940981_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 02:32:28", "author": "Faris Tanyos", "authors": ["Faris Tanyos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.57}, {"id": 225005152, "title": "MLB incorporates Negro Leagues statistics, shakes up record books", "text": "NEW YORK -- Josh Gibson became Major League Baseball's career leader with a .372 batting average, surpassing Ty Cobb's .367, when Negro Leagues records for more than 2,300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the change, which was first announced in 2020 and comes on the heels of a three-year research project, is a show of respect for the great players who were limited to performing in the Negro Leagues due to circumstances that were beyond their control, but nonetheless demonstrated that they were truly major leaguers. \u201cMaybe the single biggest factor was the success of players who played in the Negro Leagues and then came to the big leagues,\u201d Manfred told The AP.

A 17-member committee comprised of Negro Leagues historians and experts as well as statisticians was convened in order to consider how to implement the relevant numbers. The committee included MLB official historian John Thorn, who said the pandemic-shortened 60-game season in 2020 played a role in opening some eyes among baseball historians as to how truncated Negro Leagues seasons should also fit under the scope of MLB\u2019s records. Major League Baseball\u2019s official database will be updated and available to the public now with Negro Leagues figures included, such as Gibson\u2019s hitting prowess and the sensational pitching of \u201cSmokey\u201d Joe Williams. Negro Leagues players who also eventually played in the majors after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947 will also have their totals rectified.

MLB announced in December 2020 that it would be \u201ccorrecting a longtime oversight\u201d by adding the Negro League statistics, and sports fans across America, particularly Black baseball fans, are excited that it\u2019s finally come to fruition. Now, Black baseball legends make up half of the top 10 highest batting averages in pro-baseball history, including Josh Gibson, who \u201cbecame Major League Baseball\u2019s career leader with a .372 batting average, surpassing Ty Cobb\u2019s .367, when Negro Leagues records for more than 2,300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project,\u201d according to the Associated Press. Of course, the second the announcement was made, we already knew who would be mad about it, and the perpetually fragile anti-woke whites did not disappoint. That\u2019s right, folks\u2014white people who are as predictable as the sun\u2019s rise and fall schedule responded to the news of the incorporated Negro League stats by calling the MLB \u201cwoke,\u201d which is generally what they call anything that doesn\u2019t center Caucasians. They also accused the MLB of pandering to Black people while completely ignoring the fact that the only reason the Negro League\u2019s top players weren\u2019t allowed into the major leagues is that white people have always needed to be pandered to and that pandering has always included placating their racism. These people are no different than the horse of white people lamenting the relatively recent diversifying of Hollywood. For the overwhelming majority of the American entertainment industry\u2019s existence, white actors, writers and producers have dominated TV, film, broadcasting, mainstream literature, advertising and much more for no other reason than white people needing to see themselves and only themselves on the screen. But now that the pendulum has shifted even an inch towards making diversity a priority and common practice, white people have been kicking and screaming about people of color being pandered to and white people being discriminated against in \u201cwoke\u201d America. Interestingly enough, when the stats from other pro-baseball leagues were incorporated into the MLB database in the late \u201960s, it wasn\u2019t nearly this controversial. From AP: A special committee on baseball records decided in 1969 to recognize six major leagues dating to 1876: the National (which launched in 1876), the American (1901), the American Association (1882-1891), Union Association (1884), Players\u2019 League (1890) and Federal League (1914-1915). It excluded the National Association (1871-75), citing an \u201cerratic schedule and procedures.\u201d Of course, there are also white people on social media who are stretching themselves to make their objection to the Negro League stats about anything but race, such as the logistics of incorporating stats from a different league with different game scheduling and a different pool of players. Yep\u2014arrogant whitesplaining Caucasians think they know more than, say, John Thorn, MLB\u2019s official historian, or the 17-person committee that included Negro Leagues experts and statisticians, which Thorn chaired. More from AP: \u201cThe condensed 60-game season for the 2020 calendar year for the National League and American League prompted us to think that maybe the shortened Negro League seasons could come under the MLB umbrella, after all,\u201d Thorn said. The committee met six times and dealt with issues such as when compiled league statistics didn\u2019t make sense, such as a league having more wins than losses and walks that were missing. Researchers had to identify whether players with the same name were one person or separate, tracking dates of birth, and identify people listed by nicknames. Documenting transactions and identifying ballparks in a time when neutral sites often were used is ongoing, along with uncovering statistics for independent teams. \u201cWe made the decision at a point in time that we became convinced that it was possible to get accurate statistics that could be appropriately integrated into our record books,\u201d Manfred said. But, you know, these are just the people who did the research as experts in their fields.

Hours ahead of the 11:59 p.m. ET NCAA deadline Wednesday, Paul told ESPN: \"He's staying in the draft.\" James, the No. 54 prospect in the ESPN 100, has had a strong pre-draft process and elevated his standing from fringe to draftable prospect. James, a son of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, declared for the draft and entered the transfer portal in early April. As expected, he has completed his college basketball career and turned his full attention to the NBA. \"Bronny's [draft] range is wide,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He's a really good prospect who has a lot of room for growth. It only takes one team. I don't care where that team is -- it can be No. 1 or 58 -- [but] I do care about the plan, the development. The team's strategy, the opportunity and the financial commitment. That's why I'm not doing a two-way deal. Every team understands that.\" Each NBA team has three two-way contracts in addition to a 15 regular roster spots. Two-way deals limit players to 45 days on the NBA roster with a corresponding salary -- with the rest of the season spent in the G League. Two-way deals are often offered to second-round and undrafted prospects. James, 19, tested as one of the fastest and most explosive athletes at the NBA draft combine in Chicago earlier this month, ranking second among 71 participants in two 3-point shooting drills. James also had 13 points in a combine team scrimmage. He participated in a heavily attended pro day at the Lakers' practice facility last week, where he again demonstrated his highlight-reel explosiveness and improving perimeter shooting ability. James enrolled at USC last summer coming off strong showings in the McDonald's All American Game and Nike Hoop Summit, but his freshman season was derailed by a July cardiac arrest episode that led to a procedure to treat a congenital heart defect. That sidelined him for nearly five months. He made his college debut in mid-December and averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 19.4 minutes per game. USC finished a disappointing 15-18 and near the bottom of the Pac-12 standings. James was medically cleared to be drafted by the NBA's Fitness to Play Panel on the eve of the draft combine, sources told ESPN, allowing him to be a full participant in the week's on-court activities. With a month until the June 26-27 NBA draft, Paul said he and his team are determining a strategy for which and how many team workouts to conduct. \"We're still figuring it out,\" Paul told ESPN. \"Many teams have called. It's a matter of hashing out workouts and figuring out who is real and who is not. There are only two or three teams that might take him. That's how I am going to approach that.\" Because he is LeBron James' son, there has been significant conversation around Bronny James ending up on the Lakers. \"The Lakers need to look at Bronny like everyone else,\" Paul told ESPN. \"If they value him enough and he's there, that's great. If it's not the Lakers, that's great. I won't be mad if it's not. It's obvious that people hear the conversation around the dad and son playing together, but that's not our focus. If it happens organically, great. I'm not building on that. \"I'm not putting unrealistic expectations on Bronny. He's far from a finished product. But he has a hell of start. He's positioned well. ... I don't see him not getting drafted, but if it got to a point where the situations didn't make sense and we needed to go undrafted, that's fine.\" As an undrafted player, James could sign a free agent contract with any team.

Avoid shopping or important decisions from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Chicago time. After that, the moon moves from Aquarius into Pisces. Aries (March 21-April 19) You can get a lot done especially with the help of a friend or a group. Nevertheless, something unpredictable that relates to your earnings, cash flow or even something you own might occur. Perhaps a quarrel about money or possessions? Stay chill. Taurus (April 20-May 20) You\u2019re high visibility, which means people notice you more than usual. However, something unexpected might impact your dealings with parents, bosses or the police. Because you feel pumped with energy, don\u2019t do anything you will later regret. Be polite. Gemini (May 21-June 20) Travel plans are unpredictable. Likewise, schedules related to colleges and universities might also suddenly change. Nevertheless, you have ambitions in these areas. You might want to travel. You will also feel eager to explore new and adventurous avenues to learn something exciting. Cancer (June 21-July 22) This is a tricky day because most of this day is a moon alert, and for your sign, this is occurring in one of your Money houses. Therefore, do not sign important papers during the moon alert. Do not make important decisions about inheritances and shared property. Be smart. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) Relations with friends, as well as partners, might be erratic because the moon is opposite your sign. Plus, it\u2019s a moon alert, and it\u2019s dancing with unpredictable Uranus! You might also be surprised by members of the general public. Keep your eyes open because anything could happen. Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) Stay on your toes because there will be sudden changes to your work routine even though you\u2019re gung-ho to accomplish stuff. You\u2019ve got energy and you do want to work. Nevertheless, today is a bit of a crapshoot. Be careful about shared funding or budget changes. Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) Parents should be extra vigilant about their kids because this is an accident-prone day for their kids. Likewise, social events might be suddenly changed or canceled. Sports events will be competitive and accident-prone as well. Romance is tricky! Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) Steer clear of arguments at home or with family members. Even though you might be determined to make some home improvements, something could blindside you. Stay light on your feet and don\u2019t be pushy. Postpone important decisions for another day. (You\u2019ll be glad you did.) Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) Pay attention to everything you say and do today because this is an accident-prone day for you. Double check everything. Go slowly and carefully, because you\u2019ll have a tendency to barge into something. Don\u2019t do it. Postpone important decisions. Don\u2019t volunteer for anything. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) Things are dicey today with your wealth, your money and your possessions. For example, you might find money or you might lose money. Be smart and protect what you own against loss, theft or damage. Moneymaking ideas might appeal, but wait until tomorrow to run them up the proverbial flagpole. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) For most of this day, the moon is in your sign being energized by Mars and rattled by Uranus. This means you have to watch out for your actions today. Guard against impulses, which you might later regret. Think twice before you do anything. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) This is a restless day for you \u2014 no question. Therefore, postpone making any important decisions. Definitely, don\u2019t shop for anything other than food and gas. You can relax at home and take it easy with your favorite snacks and some good drinks. Wait until the moon alert is over to make financial decisions. If Your Birthday Is Today Actress Annette Bening (1958) shares your birthday. You are passionate about life. You\u2019re charming, talented and versatile, and determined to find the right career. This year will focus on responsibilities, family and service to others. Therefore, take good care of yourself so that you can be a helpful resource.

The injury ends Douglas' improbable bid to make the 2024 Paris Olympic team after an eight-year hiatus. At 28, Douglas would have been the oldest American woman to compete in gymnastics at the Olympics since 1952. Despite the injury, Douglas said she is proud of what she accomplished over her 18-month comeback. \"I love this sport and I love pushing my limits,\" Douglas told ESPN. \"I hope I can inspire both my peers and the next generation of gymnasts that age is just a number, and you can accomplish anything you work hard for.\" A two-time Olympian, Douglas became the first Black gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title at the 2012 London Games and helped the U.S. earn back-to-back team golds in London and in Rio in 2016. She announced her comeback in February and returned to competition in April at the American Classic in Katy, Texas, where she qualified to compete at U.S. championships. At the U.S. Classic in Hartford, Connecticut, earlier this month, Douglas struggled on bars before withdrawing from the remainder of the competition. The U.S. championships would have been her final chance to earn an invite to the Olympic trials in Minneapolis in June. Instead, she plans to recover from her injury and begin training for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, when she will be 32. \"I proved to myself and to the sport that my skills remain at an elite level,\" said Douglas, who also plans to reunite with her longtime representative, Lowell Taub of Range Sports. \"My plan is to continue to train for the L.A. 2028 Olympics.

That\u2019s a pretty short amount of time for a career mode, but is part of the uniqueness of a college football game where you play four years (or five, if you redshirt as a freshman, and, no, there is not a COVID year in the video game). As such, they wanted to make it an extremely replayable mode, where you can make different choices and have different outcomes throughout the experience. The structure will be pretty simple. You will choose from one of five position options: QB, RB, WR, MLB, and CB. You will also pick your archetype, which is position dependent and will determine your skill tree. You cannot max out the complete skill tree (including your mental and physical abilities), because it is no longer a matter of accruing points and putting them everywhere, but instead is all about building up the areas you pre-select. No longer will you start in high school, instead picking your level as a recruit at the beginning to determine how hard your grind will be to getting playing time \u2014 5-star (79 OVR), 4-star (75 OVR), 3-star (70 OVR), and 2-star (65 OVR). If you choose to be a 2-star, you will have to really spend a lot of time in practice before you get onto the field. If you\u2019re a 5-star, you\u2019ll still have to win a position battle (more on that in a bit) to get a starting spot. From there, you will pick the things that are most important to you among the 14 pitch grades each school has, and you will get offers based on your star-level and what schools align with what you deem most important. Once you are in school, you will not have a dorm room like the old games, but instead most of the mode will be done out of the main screen, with different scenarios popping up on your phone throughout. You will manage your time each week and have to decide how to balance your schedule between the five areas of focus \u2014 Academics, Leadership, Health, Training, and Brand. How you choose to manage your time will determine everything from your eligibility to play (yes, you can go academically ineligible) to whether you get to challenge for a starting job. Going too far in any direction means neglecting another, which has consequences. On the other hand, it\u2019s not simply a matter of balancing everything out, because that too will mean leaving things on the table. The primary goal of the mode is to make you make decisions that are not clearly black-and-white. As they explained it, the goal was to create ethical gray areas with the various dynamic scenarios that will present themselves throughout the game. Even things that seem like a good choice, may have a negative consequence \u2014 and vice-versa. By doing so, they hope to make the story element really matter, rather than cut screens you are just clicking through to get to the game. How will they do that? Well, let\u2019s dive into the five key areas. Academics When they announced you would have to maintain your GPA, many people laughed at the idea you\u2019d be taking tests in the game. That is happily (or, I guess for a few, sadly) not the case. Instead, you simply have to allocate some hours to studying, because there will be tests on your schedule and if you are not prepared (as indicated by a progress bar), you could fail and become academically ineligible. If that happens, you\u2019ll have to spend extra time with tutors, which will further set you back elsewhere. All of the elements come with potential boosts to your skill trees, and academics figure to boost your mental abilities on the field as well.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rtg-top.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=436&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"ea sports cfb rtg\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rtg-top.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rtg-top.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rtg-top.jpg?resize=704,300 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rtg-top.jpg?resize=768,327 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">EA Sports</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tThe player career mode in EA Sports College Football will force you to manage your time in five categories to get on and stay on the field.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/sports/road-to-glory-mode-ea-sports-college-football-25-details/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rtg.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 15:15:40", "author": "Robby Kalland", "authors": ["Robby Kalland"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.353}, {"id": 225075890, "title": "Everything We Know About Dynasty Mode In &#8216;EA Sports College Football 25&#8217;", "text": "The Basics Each year will feature 4,000 prospects, with 32 earning 5-star status. Pitch grades also return, with 14 in total \u2013 including Proximity to Home, Playing Time, Sending Players to the NFL, and Brand Exposure \u2013 and many recruits will have dealbreakers, where they won\u2019t consider your school if you don\u2019t meet their required grade in certain areas. Athletes are back and can play two or three positions, and it will let you know what your team needs and positional needs are in the recruiting screen, as well as which players are risk of transferring. The transfer portal is also part of the same screen, but won\u2019t open until the offseason (more on that in a bit). The recruiting process is, as they worded it, a combination of some of their greatest hits, as they felt they rolled it back too far with the points-based system. Haumiller told me they simply thought they\u2019d fix that \u201cnext year\u201d and then had to wait 11 years for the chance. Recruiting Process There is a good bit more detail in recruiting compared to \u201914, as you\u2019ll assign hours to recruits. In the offseason, your recruiting hours and transfer portal hours will be one in the same, once again forcing you to make decisions on where to focus your efforts. You\u2019ll also need to be cognizant of leaving roster spots open for portal guys. The early signing period also makes its debut in the game, with the portal opening after Early Signing Day. The recruiting process will happen in stages, as will scouting. Gone is the ability to get a full scout on a guy in one week, as you won\u2019t be able to get a guy\u2019s skill tree until you bring him on an official visit. You will have to stay above a cut line through the process, going from a recruit locking in his top 10 to top 8 to top 5 and top 3. You\u2019ll divide your allotment of recruiting hours across your recruiting board \u2013 the hours we saw on the screen were 55, but I don\u2019t have it confirmed if your recruiting hours to spend are dependent on your staff\u2019s skill trees or not. Players will again have things that are important to them within the 14 pitch grades and those will impact how interested they are in your school. There will no longer be a way to manipulate recruiting logic to pull in guys that weren\u2019t interested in you by throwing points at them. If they value proximity to home most and live in California, even if your Georgia Bulldogs are No. 1 in the nation, they won\u2019t be interested. Within that, it will be much harder to rapidly build a smaller program into a national title contender. No longer will you spend one year with a small school and be able to bring in 4-stars and 5-stars, like in \u201914. Those top recruits will not consider your school and have you locked out with dealbreakers early on. Instead, you\u2019re going to have to truly build up the program over years, building up those pitch grades to be able to land top tier talent, both in the portal and recruiting, years down the line.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ea-dynasty-top.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=436&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"ea-dynasty-top\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ea-dynasty-top.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ea-dynasty-top.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ea-dynasty-top.jpg?resize=704,300 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ea-dynasty-top.jpg?resize=768,327 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">EA Sports</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tAfter getting a first look at 'EA Sports College Football 25', here's everything we learned about Dynasty mode, like the recruiting process.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/sports/ea-sports-college-football-25-dynasty-mode-breakdown-details-recruiting-portal/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ea-dynasty.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 15:15:09", "author": "Robby Kalland", "authors": ["Robby Kalland"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.121}, {"id": 225128784, "title": "&#8216;EA Sports College Football 25&#8217; Mailbag: Answering Your Burning Questions About Dynasty, Gameplay, And More", "text": "The impending July 19 release of EA Sports College Football 25 has fans extremely excited, and that excitement has also featured a bit of frustration over the past few months with a lack of information and detail about the game. We finally got covers and a gameplay trailer in May, but still there wasn\u2019t much about the various game modes. Happily, that all changed today when the embargo lifted on everything we got to learn about the game at the EA Sports summit last week in Orlando, where a select group of media members, podcasters, and streamers got to play the game for the first time and sit through some fascinating presentations about the game. We have detailed looks at gameplay, Dynasty mode, and Road to Glory, but I also wanted to directly answer as many of your questions as possible and asked folks on Twitter to send in the things they wanted to know. Here, I tried to answer all of them that I can, with the understanding that some things may change and additions could be coming between now and release (and various in-season patches). HC/OC/DC selection is indeed back. You will be able to pick where you start your career (as well as your archetype and skill tree), and then you\u2019ll get offers in the coaching carousel to jump to different schools based on your performance. As head coach, you can also use the coaching carousel to hire and fire coaches, looking to fill out your staff with the best possible fits for your program needs based on how you want to build it out \u2014 more recruiters, better tacticians, or better motivators. More on all that is in the full Dynasty breakdown. Conference games are still locked and set in the dates based on the real rotation of games from the conferences themselves \u2014 or that EA eventually extrapolates into the future. However, you will be able to have more control over custom conferences, and can change rules to play more conference games, tweak every team\u2019s annual guaranteed opponents, and more. I also believe game times will be a bit more fluid and smarter about big matchups in this year\u2019s game than in the past, but that\u2019s TBD on how well that works exactly. Rivalry games are back, and they all have the appropriate name in the game \u2014 i.e., the War on I-4, the Battle for Paul Bunyan\u2019s axe, etc. \u2014 and the trophies are also all in the game, which means there should be a trophy case for your Dynasty as well. As for NIL, there is not anything in this version for a pretty good reason, things have been constantly changing and up until literally the day of the presentation, schools weren\u2019t allowed to do it themselves. They didn\u2019t want to build an NIL system and have to scrap it, and since as a coach you weren\u2019t supposed to be handing out money yourself, it\u2019s not part of Dynasty beyond having one of the pitch grades for your school being Brand Recognition. That last point goes hand-in-hand here, but even as NIL enters the game in future iterations, the answer to this will be: Not very. As I was told, the game is rated E for Everyone, so they\u2019re not ever planning on giving you a chance to commit crimes (or anything seedy, really). 1. No crossplay for Online Dynasty. Only for Play Now, Ultimate Team, and Road to the College Football Playoff. 2. You do not start in high school any longer, instead picking your star level as a recruit and what\u2019s important to you and getting offers based on what schools align with your pitch grades. 3. No dorm rooms to customize (that we saw), and most of the story mode seems to be played out of the main menu, with scenarios coming to you on your phone. 4. Managing GPA is all about allocating hours to study to be prepared for tests (which you will not have to take yourself). You have a progress bar telling you how prepared you are for that upcoming test, and that will determine how well you do and whether you keep a strong GPA or become academically ineligible. 5. It looks very good. The art team did a pretty incredible job with the look and feel of everything in the game \u2014 also, the weather will impact how the game plays, not just looks, so ball security is a bit tricky in the rain. Five positions \u2014 QB/RB/WR/MLB/CB. As for playing both ways, we were told \u201cstay tuned.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that means more news will be coming later on that and it will be available at launch or if that\u2019s something they\u2019ll explore for later or what. But, that\u2019s what we know. 1. Full song list is here, but no to Enter Sandman or Baba O\u2019Riley for now. They will look to add songs, but licensing costs will surely play a role (Metallica is expensive). 2. I\u2019m not sure anything seemed rushed, but I do think there will be tweaks needed in the future. Road to Glory\u2019s changes have gotten a lot of pushback from longtime fans of the mode, but I do think they\u2019ll like it better (somewhat) once they get their hands on it. The new passing system is going to take some time to adjust to and will probably require some tuning. Homefield Advantage and Stadium Pulse will be the same thing, as it could be a bit more impactful than some will want. And I\u2019d say the same with Wear & Tear, which gets me to your last question. 3. I don\u2019t want to say definitively one way or another after three hours on the sticks, but I do think it probably is a bigger factor than a lot of people will want out of a video game. I appreciate what they want to do with it and think it can be a really good addition once they have some more time with it and can tune how impactful it is and that it doesn\u2019t become the main thing. You know it, baby. Yes, you can import your full TeamBuilder school build, including unis, into Dynasty. We did not learn much about Ultimate Team in EA CFB, so I don\u2019t know what online modes will be associated with that, but Road to the College Football Playoff is basically an online season mode with ranked games that allow you to climb the rankings and make the playoff. From there, it\u2019s Dynasty, Road to Glory, and Play Now as the other options. Uproxx was invited on a hosted trip by EA Sports for reporting on this piece.

Turner was arrested first on May 23 during a raid on Kingston\u2019s rented mansion in South Florida. Not long after, the \u201cBeautiful Girls\u201d singer was picked up on the other side of the country, arrested at Fort Irwin, an Army base in California where he\u2019d been performing. Kingston (whose real name is Kisean Anderson) has since waived his right to fight extradition and will be transferred to Florida where he is facing 10 charges. The charges against Kingston and Turner include allegations of defrauding several businesses and banks, as well as passing bad checks. Kingston is also facing a probation violation charge stemming from a previous stolen property trafficking case. This isn\u2019t the first time such accusations have been leveled against mother and son. Kingston in particular has become rather notorious for not paying his bills. He\u2019s been hit with, and lost, several civil suits over the years, and is currently facing two complaints tied to outstanding balances for luxury watches and an elaborate home entertainment system. Turner, meanwhile, spent time in prison after pleading guilty to bank fraud charges back in 2006. A lawyer for Kingston, Bob Rosenblatt, has defended his client from the criminal charges, telling NBC News last week, ahead of his extradition, \u201cWe want him back [in Florida] ASAP so we can show this is merely a civil case and not criminal. We look forward to challenging this case in court.\u201d Here\u2019s everything we know about the Kingston case so far. The Arrests Janice Turner was arrested after a Broward County Sheriff Deputies and a Davie, Florida police SWAT team raided Kingston\u2019s rented mansion in South Florida. According to reports at the time, authorities were seen loading a van with various items, though it\u2019s unclear what they were taking. After Kingston\u2019s arrest in California a few hours later, the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a statement saying, \u201cThis evening, police in Fort Irwin, Calif., arrested Kisean Anderson, aka Sean Kingston, without incident on a Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office arrest warrant for numerous fraud and theft charges.\u201d In between the two arrests, Kingston appeared to address the brewing issue in an Instagram post that was eventually taken down. He reportedly wrote, \u201cPeople love negative energy! I am good, and so is my mother! \u2026 My lawyers are handling everything as we speak.\u201d The Arrest Warrants and Accusations The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office finally revealed some details about the charges against Kingston and Turner after releasing their arrest warrants. The alleged incidents took place between Oct. 2023 and March 2024, with mother and son hit with eight of the same charges, including the overall accusation that they carried out an \u201corganized scheme\u201d to defraud a variety of businesses. While specifics were not shared, the warrant accused Kingston and Turner of stealing over $86,000 from a furniture store and over $159,000 from a car dealer over a Cadillac Escalade. The biggest charge involved a jewelry store allegedly bilked out of items worth $480,000. Turner was also accused of a couple instances of identity theft, with Kingston labeled a \u201cprincipal in committing the crime.\u201d According to the warrants, Turner used someone else\u2019s identity to take over $200,000 from Bank of America, and over $100,000 from First Republic Bank. She also allegedly passed a bad check worth over $44,000, with Kingston allegedly benefitting from the crime. Kingston was hit with his own identity theft charge as well, accused of defrauding the online banking platform Novo out of $5,000 or more. Simultaneous Civil Suit Back in February, a Florida company called Ver Ver Entertainment sued Kingston, claiming he didn\u2019t pay the the majority of a $150,000 bill he owed for the installation of a massive television (232 inches) and an accompanying sound system. Kingston allegedly told the company that if they gave him a low down payment and credit, he and Justin Bieber would record a commercial for them. Those commercials never happened, and Kingston never paid the remaining $120,000 balance on his bill, according to the suit. After the raid and Turner\u2019s arrest, an attorney representing Ver Ver, Dennis Card, told NBC 6 in South Florida, \u201c[Kingston] likes having bling, he likes showing off, he\u2019s a showman. My client has a $150,000 television sound system that\u2019s in there, there\u2019s also about $1 million worth of watches that are in there, there\u2019s a $80,000 custom bed that was ordered. This is an organized systematic fraud.\u201d He added: \u201c[Kingston\u2019s] got basically a script, he says that he works with Justin Bieber, and that he obviously puts on a big show here, this is a rental house, he doesn\u2019t own it, and he lures people using his celebrity into having them release things without him paying for it and then he simply never pays.\u201d Card also clarified that that Bieber was \u201c100 percent not involved in this,\u201d adding: \u201cHe had the misfortune of doing some work in the past with Sean, and Sean drops his name like crazy.\u201d Past Incidents This is far from the first time Kingston and Turner has faced major fraud allegations, though those have largely taken the form of civil suits. In 2015, a custom watch seller successfully sued the pair for $356,000 over an unpaid bill, while a New York jeweler was similarly successful in 2018, suing mother and son for $301,000 over nine items (via The Associated Press). In his quotes to the press, Card alluded to claims brought against Kingston last year by Dream Watch, a Malaysian luxury watch company that accused the musician of failing to pay for two items: A Richard Mille Model RM 65.01 Automatic and a Patek Phillipe Calibre. Kingston allegedly told the company he\u2019d wire them the funds then proceeded to make excuses, like that his account had been frozen. As of last November, Dream Watch was seeking a default judgement in the case after Kingston allegedly did not respond to the suit. In February, however the judge approved a request from Dream Watch\u2019s lawyers to vacate the default judgement. According to the Los Angeles County Court website, a hearing is scheduled for later this week. The company\u2019s legal team did not immediately respond Rolling Stone\u2018s request for comment on the status of the case. Then there was a Dec. 2020 story in TMZ that reported authorities had put out a warrant for Kingston\u2019s arrest on grand theft charges related to another allegedly unpaid jewelry bill. Police declined to pursue Kingston at the time. Kingston did ultimately land on probation for a trafficking in stolen property charge. Florida corrections records show Kingston was sentenced to probation in Oct. 2023, while the \u201coffense date\u201d was listed as Oct. 2020. Kingston\u2019s probation \u2014 which he\u2019s now been charged with violating \u2014 was set to last through Oct. 1, 2025. As for Turner, she pleaded guilty to filing false loan applications and committing bank fraud to the tune of over $160,000 in 2006. She ultimately spent a year-and-a-half in prison. What\u2019s Next? On Tuesday, May 28, Kingston waived his right to fight extradition and will be turned over to authorities in Broward County. He did not appear in court over the extradition issue, instead singing papers agreeing to skip any hearings. The Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office said they would coordinate with authorities on California to return Kingston to Florida. He has been held in the San Bernardino county jail since his arrest. Meanwhile, Turner is being held in Broward County jail on a $160,000 bond. She appeared in court last Friday, where her attorney tried to argue for a lower bond, but was rebuffed. Turner was also ordered to hand over her passport.", "summary": "The \"Beautiful Girls\" singer and his mother are accused of bilking numerous businesses \u2014 and they've faced similar claims in the past", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-kingston-fraud-charges-explained-1235029565/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1530520871.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 20:24:54", "author": "Jon Blistein", "authors": ["Jon Blistein"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.14}, {"id": 225197024, "title": "Everything we know about Knives Out 3", "text": "The game is once again afoot for renowned detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). Fans have eagerly awaited news on the third Knives Out film, and writer-director Rian Johnson delivered with a teaser announcing the film's title, Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, and the announcement that production was about to begin. \"I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is,\" Johnson teased in a statement posted to Twitter/X. \"There\u2019s a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.\" Scant details on the project are known besides the fact that it's coming to Netflix sometime in 2025 and that it will once again star Craig as private investigator Benoit Blanc. But if we know Johnson, he'll be dropping plenty of clues along the way. So, we're ready to compile a case file as the release date draws ever nearer, and we'll add clues as we discover them. Here's everything we know about Wake Up Dead Man. The Case As has been true of the previous two Knives Out movies, very few details about the central mystery have been revealed. But we can make some educated guesses based on the title and the teaser announcement video. In his post on social media, Johnson teased, \"We\u2019re about to go into production on the 3rd one, and I\u2019m very, very excited to share the title, which gives a little hint of where it\u2019s going.\" In the case of each of the films, the title has contained a clue as to the direction of the story. As with the previous two entries in the series, the title takes its name from a rock song. Wake Up Dead Man shares its title with a U2 song off their 1997 album Pop. The song is fairly straightforward, featuring Bono's plea that Jesus return and save humanity from itself. There's even some hint of yearning for an apocalyptic event to restart the world. Perhaps Benoit Blanc will be contending with a messianic figure this time? The biblical nature of things is also reinforced by Craig's voiceover in the title announcement video. \"In the beginning, the knives came out,\" Craig's Benoit says. \"Then behold, the glass was shattered. But my most dangerous case yet is about to be revealed.\" The use of phrases like \"in the beginning\" and \"then behold,\" as well as the word \"revealed,\" echoes a suggested religious tone, using common lingo from the Bible. Additionally, the typeface used for the title is a form of Gothic Blackletter, commonly used in the printing of Bibles in the 16th and 17th centuries. The video also showcases a coffin in its imagery, and the final sound we hear is the tolling of a church bell. The Suspects In each of his cases, Blanc has had to face off against a murderer's row of suspects, having to outsmart and outlast them to uncover the truth. Wake Up Dead Man will be no exception, with its ensemble already shaping up to be quite the colorful cast. Josh O'Connor, fresh off his highly acclaimed performance in the sexy sports drama Challengers, takes on a role in the third Knives Out entry. O'Connor has proved he is equally adept at portraying a sexy dirtbag as he is an overwhelmed, shy man, so we shall see which version of him comes out to play. Cailee Spaeny's career is on the upswing, having just delivered the one-two punch of her award-nominated take on Priscilla Presley in Priscilla and a starring role in the provocative Civil War. She's no stranger to murder mysteries, previously appearing in HBO's Mare of Easttown. Andrew Scott has a knack for portraying devilishly handsome criminal masterminds, be it Tom Ripley in Ripley or Moriarty in Sherlock. But he's also fantastic at ripping out our hearts as a devastating leading man, as he did in both Fleabag and All of Us Strangers. How will his gift for playing slippery, unknowable figures factor in here? Eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close is the latest star joining the ensemble, according to The Hollywood Reporter. While her role is also under wraps, Close promises to bring some veteran gravitas to the cast. She's also well-versed in the mystery genre, having previously starred in the 2017 Agatha Christie adaptation Crooked House. The Scene of the Crime In the Knives Out films, the setting is just as much a character as any member of the ensemble. The first film oozed classic cozy murder mystery with its New England setting, centered around the Thrombey estate with its sense of old-money grandeur. Glass Onion moved away from the first film's snowy, sweater-weather climes to a positively balmy Mediterranean destination, situating the majority of the action on a private island in Greece. But where will Wake Up Dead Man take place? The setting has yet to be revealed, but we'll say that the teaser video gives us some seriously spooky, Gothic vibes. The Timeline Beyond Johnson's announcement that production is about to begin, we don't know much about the timing here. Netflix says the film will premiere in 2025, and we'd guess, based on production schedules, that it will debut sometime in the second half of the year (likely around the same Thanksgiving window as the first two films).

In a New York Times opinion piece published Tuesday, French Gates wrote that she is committed to advocating for women and girls, emphasizing that with women in many states facing growing restrictions on abortion, she felt increasingly \"compelled to support reproductive rights here at home.\" \"For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women's rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match,\" French Gates wrote. French Gates, who announced her decision to step down from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation earlier this month, says her decision to donate the $1 billion was motivated in part by the racial gap in mortality rates for women. Additionally, she pointed out the rise in political violence and other threats when it comes to women and their safety. \"It\u2019s frustrating and shortsighted. Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone,\" French Gates said. The philanthropist noted that her planned investment includes $200 million aimed at increasing the work of organizations that advance and protect women\u2019s rights. In addition, she says it will include $240 million in partnerships with 12 global leaders, including former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern; athlete and maternal health advocate Allyson Felix; and Afghan educator and women\u2019s rights advocate Shabana Basij-Rasikh \u2014 each receiving a $20 million fund to distribute to organizations that improve women\u2019s health both in the U.S. and internationally. \"As a young woman, I could never have imagined that one day I would be part of an effort like this. Because I have been given this extraordinary opportunity, I am determined to do everything I can to seize it and to set an agenda that helps other women and girls set theirs, too,\" French Gates wrote. News of French Gates' latest philanthropic efforts comes after she announced her departure earlier this month as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 a foundation she has helped lead since its inception more than two decades ago. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the 59-year-old said she was \"immensely proud\" of the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the decision to step down as co-chair was not easy. French Gates' last day with the foundation is June 7. \"I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world,\" she wrote in her announcement. French Gates and her former husband, Bill Gates, launched the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 and is a massive donor to issues surrounding global health. Since the foundation's start, Bill Gates has donated about $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock to the global organization, Forbes reported. In 2021, Melinda and Bill Gates announced the end of their 27-year marriage. At the time of their separation, the two said they still shared a belief in the foundation's mission and would continue to work together despite their marriage ending. \u2014 Editors Note: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is among NPR's financial supporters.", "summary": "The 59-year-old says her decision to donate $1 billion was in part due to the racial gap in women's mortality rates.

French Gates, one of the biggest philanthropic supporters of gender equity in the U.S., said Tuesday in a guest essay for The New York Times that she's been frustrated over the years by people who say it's not the right time to talk about gender equality. \"Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone,\" she wrote. French Gates said over the last few weeks she's started directing what will total $200 million in new grants through her organization, Pivotal Ventures, to groups working in the U.S. to protect women's rights and advance their power and influence.

The groups include the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights. Teresa Younger, the president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, who also received a grant, has long called on donors to give unrestricted, multi-year funding to organizations. She praised French Gates' new commitment as a part of a larger trend of major women donors giving generously to nonprofits. \"If philanthropy took lessons from the way that women are moving money, we would see more money in the field having greater impact,\" Younger said. Her organization learned of the grant, which is the first they've received from Pivotal Ventures within the last week, and Younger said there was no application process. She declined to disclose the amount of the grant but said it would help expand their work with organizations in the South and Midwest. The nonprofit MomsRising Education Fund also received a grant that will extend to the end of 2026, with Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, its executive director and CEO, saying, \"We're deeply honored and enormously grateful that Melinda French Gates is stepping up for women and families in a time when the rights of our daughters may be significantly less than of ourselves or our own mothers.\" French Gates also pledged to give 12 individuals $20 million each to distribute to nonprofit organizations of their choice before the end of 2026. Those funds will be managed by the National Philanthropic Trust, one of the largest public charities that offers donor-advised funds, a spokesperson for Pivotal Ventures said. In total, French Gates announced $690 million in commitments out of the promised $1 billion, which also include an \"open call\" for applications that the organization Lever for Change will administer this fall. French Gates said $250 million will be awarded to fund organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally. French Gates' Pivotal Ventures is a limited liability company that also manages investments in for profit ventures, so there is little public information about its grantmaking or the assets it manages. Pivotal Ventures has focused on a number of avenues to increase women's economic and political participation and power, like closing the wage gap, compensating care work often done by women, and encouraging women to run for political office. Pivotal Ventures said it has committed $875 million of the $1 billion that French Gates pledged in 2019 to a mixture of venture and philanthropic funding. Additionally, the Gates Foundation has funded research and interventions to improve maternal mortality and women's health more broadly for years. In 2020, it hired its first president for its gender quality division and in 2021, the foundation pledged $2.1 billion to gender equity efforts convened by UN Women. In her essay Tuesday, French Gates touched upon the high maternal mortality rates in the U.S., noting that Black and Native American mothers are at the highest risk. \"Women in 14 states have lost the right to terminate a pregnancy under almost any circumstances. We remain the only advanced economy without any form of national paid family leave.

The announcement comes in a US election year in which abortion is expected to play a pivotal role, as Democrats seek to exploit voter dissatisfaction with Republican efforts to restrict access to the procedure.

The funding is making waves and will leave big marks in the landscape of reproductive-focused groups who rely on donations to operate, but begs the question: does philanthropy trump the need for supportive policy in addressing reproductive health and justice? \u201cWhen we allow this cause to go so chronically underfunded, we all pay the cost. As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had,\u201d she said. In the essay, the Center for Reproductive Rights, National Women\u2019s Law Center, and the National Domestic Workers Alliance were named by French Gates as beneficiaries of grants from her organization Pivotal Ventures, with an additional 13 non-profits and 12 individuals listed on Pivotal\u2019s website as grantees. \u201cWhile I have long focused on improving contraceptive access overseas, in the post-Dobbs era, I now feel compelled to support reproductive rights here at home. For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women\u2019s rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match,\u201d wrote French Gates. French Gates has a history of donating to reproductive rights organizations through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which she announced she will be stepping down from next week. In 2022, Forbes reported that the Gates Foundation had donated $81 million mostly to Planned Parenthood\u2019s international affiliates, though the foundation also provided funding to pro-life organizations, including World Vision International. Though according to Forbes Warren Buffet, through the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, is the largest funder of abortion groups in the U.S., donating $2 billion to several pro-choice groups since 2000, analysis by CNN published Wednesday credited MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, with shifting philanthrop to a more collaborative, unrestricted giving that does not uphold traditional measures of impact. In 2022, Scott broke records by donating $275 million to Planned Parenthood, which they stated in a press release was the largest single-donor donation in the organization\u2019s history. \u201cI think it\u2019s been the bane of a lot of nonprofits\u2019 existence is that, if it\u2019s government grants, they have to comply with a lot of red tape to demonstrate that they\u2019re having an impact,\u201d Amir Pasic, the dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy told CNN. \u201cAnd I think a lot of philanthropies, especially the highly professional foundations kind of emulate that way of looking at things \u2014 they want you to know how to measure the impact that you\u2019re having \u2026 And nobody asks the nonprofits if these are even the appropriate impact measures.\u201d Philanthropy plays an important role\u2026 But has limitations. Only about 2% of charitable giving in the U.S. goes to organizations focused on women and girls. This underscores the need for increased funding, especially in the wake of the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, according to the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. \u201cOnly about half a percentage point [of the 2%] goes to organizations focused on women of color specifically,\u201d French Gates wrote in her New York Times piece. The need has increased as access to abortion and reproductive health services, amidst a maternal health crisis, has led to a more pressing demand to aid individuals in need. Following the Dobbs decision, reproductive rights-focused organizations and abortion funds saw an influx of rage donations but acknowledged that it would take long term solutions to continue to serve their communities and meet the demands of women seeking abortion, especially as more areas of the country lose access to this healthcare. \u201cThis is the time for philanthropy to get creative and reach out to abortion funds, who have traditionally been underfunded in the reproductive health world,\u201d Kelly Nelson, co-founder of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund told PBS NewsHour in 2022. While donations help organizations run, experts say they don\u2019t provide solutions to the root of the issue it\u2019s looking to address. Rob Reich, director of the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society and is the Marc and Laura Andreessen Faculty Co-director at the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University said that while philanthropy can provide direct services to people, it does not negate an institutional effort to meet the basic needs of people or ensure people have what they are entitled to. \u201cIn that respect, charity is a good thing \u2013 it provides people things that they might deserve or need. But it doesn\u2019t get at the root source of the problem,\u201d Reich told the Stanford Report in 2018. \u201cFor example, is donating money or volunteering at the soup kitchen going to bring an end to hunger? The two are completely separate things. What\u2019s appropriate for a soup kitchen is an aspiration to self-liquidation, to social conditions that render soup kitchens unnecessary.\u201d Reproductive justice movement leaders have continuously called on the government to support policy protecting reproductive rights and access. In January 2024,13 Black-led organizations penned a letter to Biden outlining the administrations opportunity to advance reproductive justice for Black women, girls, and gender-expansive individuals through advancing voter rights, eliminate restrictions on abortion care, and expand the scope of Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access to cover all intersecting issues. In March, Biden signed an executive order investing $12 billion in government funding for women\u2019s health, including sexual and reproductive health conditions, pledging $200 million for fiscal year 2025. French Gates\u2019 billion-dollar pledge is a testament to the growing recognition of the need for investment in women\u2019s rights. But in the face of ongoing political challenges, can philanthropy alone bridge the gap between where we are and where we need to be? The answer may lie in a combination of both private generosity and public commitment.", "summary": "MacKenzie Scott, Warren Buffett, and now Melinda French Gates: are billionaire donations enough to secure women's rights in the post-Roe era?", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/reckon/2024/05/melinda-french-gates-billion-sparks-debate-is-philanthropy-enough-to-secure-womens-rights.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/U3XTTYN7EFE6HLIDVWQKGBDWUA.jpg?auth=0c2faf2dc3f75e552bff1e9559e052b5cb964b3f05f811b5222da8d07cfd91e4&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 21:10:06", "author": "Annabel Rocha", "authors": ["Annabel Rocha"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.127}]}, {"news": [{"id": 224768958, "title": "Rapper Sean Kingston to be extradited to Florida and face $1 million fraud charges", "text": "Rapper and singer Sean Kingston on Tuesday waived his right to fight extradition in a California court and agreed to be turned over to authorities in Florida, where he and his mother are charged with committing more than a million dollars worth of fraud.

Kingston\u2019s mother was released from jail this week after posting bail from a legitimate source, a court order signed by a judge on Sunday shows. Kingston is facing 10 charges: organized scheme to defraud over $50,000; four counts of criminal use of personal identification information; three counts of grand theft, two of them worth over $100,000; one count of uttering an insufficient funds check for over $150; and one count of violating his probation, according to an arrest warrant signed three days before the Sheriff\u2019s Office raid.

Kingston and his mother are accused of defrauding multiple business, including a jewelry business, a luxury bed company, a used luxury and exotic car dealership and a luxury microLED TV company, since October 2023, the warrants said. A piece of furniture from the luxury bed company was worth over $86,000 while a Cadillac Escalade from the dealership worth nearly $160,000 and $480,000 worth of jewelry from another person, according to the warrants. At least $300,000 was allegedly fraudulently obtained by Turner and Kingston by using the personal identification information of Bank of America and First Republic Bank. The hours-long raid at Kingston\u2019s home was a spectacle in Southwest Ranches. Law enforcement and people who had sold items to Kingston were seen moving in and out of the property for hours, packing up two U-Haul trucks. Attorney Dennis Card is representing a company actively suing Kingston over breach of contract and fraud. Workers for Ver Ver Entertainment installed a $150,000 home entertainment system at Kingston\u2019s mansion that they said in their February lawsuit complaint Kingston only paid a down payment of $30,000.

Hours before his arrest Thursday, Kingston reassured his Instagram followers in a since-deleted story: \"I am good, and so is my mother!.. my lawyers are handling everything as we speak.\" Details about Kingston and Turner's alleged fraud and theft emerged days after the raid and their arrests. A Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office arrest warrant reviewed by The Times accuses Kingston and Turner of stealing more than $480,000 worth of jewelry from an individual, a Cadillac Escalade worth nearly $160,000 and furniture that cost upward of $86,500. The warrant alleges that they also stole more than $200,000 from Bank of America and more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank. Police also charged Kingston with allegedly violating the terms of his two-year probation for trafficking stolen property in a 2020 incident involving an unpaid jewelry bill.

I was too busy eating beignets, riding street cars and ogling Anne Rice\u2019s epic Garden District house. Now I\u2019m immersed in New Orleans ISPs as I seek out the best broadband providers for Big Easy residents. The scene is dominated by cable provider Cox and DSL/fiber provider AT&T. There are a few alternatives, including 5G home internet from Verizon and T-Mobile, but it\u2019s mostly a two-horse race. AT&T Fiber is CNET\u2019s pick for the best overall internet provider in New Orleans due to straightforward pricing, fast speeds and equally fast uploads. It\u2019s not available to every address in the metro area, which is where Cox comes in with its wide coverage. CNET examines customer service, speed, pricing and overall value before recommending the best broadband in your area. Your ISP choices will vary depending on location, but Cox and AT&T Fiber can deliver gigabit speeds. All prices listed on this page reflect available discounts for setting up paperless billing. If you decide not to go with automatic monthly payments, your price will be higher. Cue up some Louis Armstrong, and let\u2019s look at the best internet providers in New Orleans. Best internet providers in The Big Easy I\u2019m fully on the fiber train for home internet, so AT&T Fiber is at the top of my recommended list for New Orleans. If you can\u2019t get fiber at your house, look to Cox\u2019s cable service or 5G home internet from T-Mobile or Verizon. Note: The prices, speeds and features detailed in the article text may differ from those listed in the product detail cards, which represent providers\u2019 national offerings. Your particular internet service options -- including prices and speeds -- depend on your address and may differ from those detailed here. New Orleans internet providers compared Source: CNET analysis of provider data All available New Orleans residential internet providers While New Orleans is mainly an AT&T-versus-Cox battleground, there are a few other options. Verizon 5G Home Internet is especially worthy of a look if you can\u2019t get fiber and want an alternative way to get online. AT&T Internet: I chose AT&T Fiber for special recognition, but there\u2019s another side to the company\u2019s internet offerings. AT&T Internet is the ISP\u2019s outdated DSL service. Speeds max out at 100Mbps in some areas, but many New Orleans residents may find drastically lower speeds. There\u2019s no contract, and service costs $55 per month for whatever speed level you can get at your address. Consider this a last-ditch option if fiber, 5G or cable doesn\u2019t work out for you.Skycom1: Local fixed wireless ISP Skycom1 primarily serves businesses, hotels and apartment buildings. It doesn\u2019t advertise pricing online, so check with your apartment complex to determine if it services your address.Verizon 5G Home Internet: Verizon gives T-Mobile a run for its money regarding 5G home internet. Which one you choose will depend on open slots, your location and if you have a phone with one or the other. Verizon has strong 5G Ultra Wideband coverage across the metro area and even offers speeds up to 1,000Mbps through its $70-per-month 5G Home Plus plan in some spots. The ISP\u2019s basic 5G Home plan runs $50 monthly for typical speeds of 85-300Mbps. Verizon is instituting a price hike for bundled plans, bringing the lowest-cost plan up to $35 per month when paired with an eligible phone plan.Satellite internet: If you\u2019re out of faster or more affordable options, there\u2019s always satellite internet from Starlink, Viasat or HughesNet. Satellite service can be slow and expensive, so it\u2019s usually of interest to rural residences with few (or no other) choices in ISP. New Orleans broadband at a glance ISP availability is extremely address-dependent in New Orleans. Your buddy a couple of blocks away may have AT&T Fiber while your home only gets Cox or AT&T DSL. Home internet from Verizon or T-Mobile can save you a little money if you bundle with a phone plan. Those services are easy to test out, and I recommend giving them a whirl if you\u2019re not satisfied with your wired ISP options. Pricing info on New Orleans home internet service Expect to pay at least $50 per month for home internet in New Orleans. Cox\u2019s service, for example, runs $50 per month for 100Mbps downloads. When it comes to value, AT&T Fiber\u2019s $55-per-month 300Mbps plan is worthy of consideration. Cheap internet options in the New Orleans metro area It\u2019s a challenge to bargain shop for internet in New Orleans since all the major providers kick off at about the $50-per-month level. If you\u2019re already a Verizon or T-Mobile phone customer, then check into pairing your home internet with an eligible mobile plan for a bundle discount. Low-income households should look into eligibility for the federal Affordable Connectivity Program. If you qualify you can get $30 (or $75 on tribal lands) off your monthly internet bill. Cox offers discounted plans for qualified low-income customers and families with children. The ConnectAssist program gets you 100Mbps speeds for $30 a month while the Connect2Compete (for families with kids) is $10 per month. Cox also participates in the ACP. AT&T offers a similar deal for a 100Mbps plan that\u2019s free with the ACP subsidy. What's the cheapest internet plan in New Orleans? Source: CNET analysis of provider data How fast is the broadband in New Orleans? Recent Ookla speed test data put New Orleans way down in 93rd place for median download speeds among the 100 most populous cities in the US. New Orleans logged an average of 158Mbps. Compare that to top-ranked Raleigh, North Carolina at nearly 280Mbps. While FCC data shows that all of New Orleans can access broadband internet, remember that the FCC says 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up qualify as broadband. Yes, that\u2019s pretty slow. Gig speeds and higher are harder to come by in the Big Easy. Your best bets for fast speeds will be with AT&T Fiber or Cox. Fastest internet providers in New Orleans It\u2019s hard to touch AT&T Fiber when it comes to the fastest internet in New Orleans. The ISP maxes out at 5,000Mbps and no one else comes close. The catch is its patchwork availability across the metro area. If you\u2019re moving to town and multi-gig speeds are a must, then do your homework on AT&T Fiber\u2019s service areas and aim to land within its coverage zone. If fiber doesn\u2019t come to your home, then check into Cox\u2019s 1-gig cable plan as an alternative. Just keep in mind that cable can\u2019t touch fiber\u2019s fast upload speeds. What are the fastest internet plans in New Orleans? Source: CNET analysis of provider data What\u2019s the final word on internet providers in New Orleans? In New Orleans, the most common question when it comes to home internet is \u201cAT&T or Cox?\u201d I recommend looking at A&T Fiber first and Cox cable second. Don\u2019t sleep on T-Mobile and Verizon as 5G home internet alternatives, particularly if fiber isn\u2019t available to you. How CNET chose the best internet providers in New Orleans Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. It doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we\u2019re considering every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. To evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service, we look at sources including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they're paying? Are customers happy with their service? While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend.

AT&T is the best internet provider for most households in Reno due to its range of speeds, pricing and internet options. This includes Internet Air, Fiber and 5G. However, AT&T service isn\u2019t available everywhere in Reno, so Spectrum or locally based provider Net NV are also solid picks, depending on what\u2019s available in your area. If you're hunting for the lowest prices or the fastest speeds, we've got it. The cheapest internet in Reno is Spectrum, offering up to 300 megabits per second for $50 per month.

Other available internet providers in Reno Satellite internet: Reno residents have their pick of satellite internet providers, including Hughesnet, Viasat and Starlink. However, unless your only other option is a slower DSL plan, we wouldn't recommend it due to high fees (including steep equipment rental costs) and a two-year contract commitment. The exception might be Starlink, which offers faster speeds without the contract. However, there's a steep upfront equipment cost of nearly $600. Whoa.T-Mobile Home Internet: This major mobile carrier offers Reno's best 5G home internet service with an affordable, internet-only plan of $50 per month with no additional equipment fees or commitments. Existing customers with eligible mobile phone plans can add home internet for just $30 monthly. There is a one-time $35 activation fee, but they are currently waiving it if you order online.

Vexus Fiber is the best internet service provider overall for most households in Harlingen because of its symmetrical speeds and reasonable introductory pricing. You can\u2019t get Vexus Fiber everywhere in Harlingen, but the network is rapidly expanding, and it offers plans of up to 5 Gig speeds. Spectrum or T-Mobile Home Internet are also solid picks, depending on what\u2019s available in your area. We've also found those top options if you're hunting for the lowest prices or fastest speeds. The cheapest internet in Harlingen is Spectrum's $50-per-month plan with 300 megabits per second download speeds. It skims in under Vexus Fiber's 150Mbps plan, which costs $40 per month but has an additional $10 network access fee tacked on. Harlingen's fastest internet speed comes from both Vexus, Gigabit Fiber and Spectrum. All of which offer 1,000Mbps downloads and are available across town. Best internet in Harlingen, Texas Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Other available internet providers in Harlingen AT&T Fiber: AT&T\u2019s fiber network is extremely scarce around Harlingen, but you might find a few isolated pockets of coverage, like around Ed Carey Drive and Morris Road. Plans range from $55 monthly for 300Mbps to $80 for a gig. There are no contracts, data caps or equipment fees. AT&T Internet Air: AT&T's legacy DSL network, which extends across large areas of Harlingen, no longer offers services to new customers. Luckily, its newer fixed wireless service, AT&T Internet Air. Pricing is $55 monthly for whatever speed you can get at your address. Typical speeds range from 75Mbps to 225Mbps, but your mileage may vary. There are no data caps, equipment fees or contracts. Gigabit Communications: The residential services side of Gigabit Communications provides fixed wireless internet in the Harlingen area. Here\u2019s how fixed wireless compares to other connection types. Plans start at $49 per month for 50Mbps and top out at $99 monthly for 100Mbps. There are no data caps. Check into this option if you\u2019re in a rural location and can\u2019t get coverage from a faster or more affordable ISP. Satellite internet: Rural homes with few (or no) internet options can check into satellite service from Starlink, Viasat or Hughesnet. It\u2019s not the cheapest internet, and speeds can be slow and variable. Consider satellite as a last resort when other ISPs are unavailable or unsatisfactory.Verizon 5G Home Internet: While Verizon\u2019s home internet service reaches up to gig downloads in some places, you\u2019ll find it tops out at 300Mbps in Harlingen. The 5G Home plan costs $50 per month for speeds up to 100Mbps, while the 5G Home Plus plan is $70 per month for speeds up to 300Mbps. Bundle with an eligible phone plan to bring down your home internet price. VTX1: VTX1 is a regional fiber and fixed wireless ISP but offers only fixed wireless in Harlingen. Prices start at $55 per month and reach 400Mbps, but you\u2019ll need to check directly with VTX1 to find out what\u2019s available for your specific location. Check into this as an option if you\u2019re in a rural spot outside of town or don\u2019t have good options for wired internet at home. Cheap internet options in Harlingen You won\u2019t find much in the way of bargain-basement internet prices in Harlingen. Most plans start around $50 monthly, including Spectrum\u2019s 300Mbps cable plan. While Vexus Fiber starts at $40 per month for 150Mbps, you have to add a $10 network access fee the ISP says it uses to maintain and enhance its infrastructure. That means the entry-level Vexus plan effectively costs $50 per month. To sidestep equipment rental fees, you must provide your own router for either Spectrum or Vexus. One way to lower your monthly home internet cost is to use a 5G home internet option from T-Mobile, Verizon or AT&T and then bundle an eligible mobile plan. This makes the most sense if you can get a strong connection at your house and are already a phone customer with a qualifying plan. What's the cheapest internet plan in Harlingen?

Most internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address. For more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need. 0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming. 100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming. 500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time. How CNET chose the best internet providers in Harlingen Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. It doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they're paying? Are customers happy with their service? While the answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page. What\u2019s the final word on internet providers in Harlingen? There are two main competitors in Harlingen regarding wired home internet: Spectrum and Vexus. Spectrum has an advantage in coverage area while Vexus offers desirable fiber plans with fast upload speeds. If both service your address, then consider your upload needs. Both ISPs will raise your rates after your initial promotional period ends, but Vexus has a more affordable introductory deal at the gig level. If you\u2019re dissatisfied with your wired internet options, check into 5G home internet from AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile.

Speaking in an interview on The TED AI Show podcast, AI researcher Helen Toner accused Altman of lying to and obstructing OpenAI's board, retaliating against those who criticised him, and creating a \"toxic atmosphere\". \"The [OpenAI] board is a nonprofit board that was set up explicitly for the purpose of making sure that the company's public good mission was primary \u2014 was coming first over profits, investor interests, and other things,\" Toner said to The TED AI Show host Bilawal Sidhu. \"But for years, Sam had made it really difficult for the board to actually do that job by, you know, withholding information, misrepresenting things that were happening at the company, in some cases outright lying to the board.\" Tweet may have been deleted OpenAI fired Altman on Nov. 17 last year, a shock move that took many both inside and outside the company by surprise. According to Toner, the decision was not made lightly, involving weeks of intense discussion. The secrecy surrounding it was also by design, she said. \"It was very clear to all of us that as soon as Sam had any inkling that we might do something that went against him he would pull out all the stops, do everything in his power to undermine the board, to prevent us from, you know, even getting to the point of being able to fire him,\" said Toner. \"So we were very careful, very deliberate about who we told, which was essentially almost no one in advance other than, obviously, our legal team.\" Unfortunately for Toner and the rest of OpenAI's board, their careful planning didn't produce the desired result. While Altman was initially ousted, OpenAI quickly rehired him as CEO following days of outcry, accusations, and uncertainty. The company also put in place an almost entirely new board, removing those who had tried to depose Altman. Why did OpenAI's board fire CEO Sam Altman? Toner didn't specifically discuss the aftermath of that tumultuous time on the podcast. However, she did elaborate on exactly why OpenAI's board came to the conclusion that Alman had to go. Earlier this week, Toner and fellow former board member Tasha McCauley published an op-ed in The Economist stating that they decided to eject Altman due to \"long-standing patterns of behavior.\" Toner has now provided examples of said behaviour in her talk with Sidhu \u2014 including the claim that OpenAI's own board weren't told when ChatGPT was released, only finding out via social media. \"When ChatGPT came out [in] November 2022, the board was not informed in advance about that. We learned about GPT on Twitter,\" Toner alleged. \"Sam didn't inform the board that he owned the OpenAI startup fund, even though he constantly was claiming to be an independent board member with no financial interest in the company. On multiple occasions he gave us inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place, meaning that it was basically impossible for the board to know how well those safety processes were working or what might need to change.\" Toner also accused Altman of deliberately targeting her after taking objection to a research paper she had co-authored. Entitled \"Decoding Intentions: Artificial Intelligence and Costly Signals,\" the paper discussed the dangers of AI, and included an analysis of both OpenAI and competitor Anthropic's safety measures. However, Altman reportedly considered the academic paper too critical of OpenAI and complimentary of its rival. Toner told The TED AI Show that after the paper was published in October last year, Altman began spreading lies to the other board members in an effort to have her removed. This alleged incident only further damaged the board's trust in him, she said, as they had already been seriously discussing firing Altman by that time. \"[F]or any individual case, Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous-sounding explanation of why it wasn't a big deal or misinterpreted or whatever,\" Toner said. \"But the end effect was that after years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him [OpenAI board members Toner, McCauley, Adam D'Angelo, and Ilya Sutskever] came to the conclusion that we just couldn't believe things that Sam was telling us. \"And that's a completely unworkable place to be in as a board, especially a board that is supposed to be providing independent oversight over the company, not just like, you know, helping the CEO to raise more money. Not trusting the word of the CEO, who is your main conduit to the company, your main source of information about the company, it's just totally, totally impossible.\" Toner stated that OpenAI's board did make attempts to address these issues, instituting new policies and processes. However, other executives then reportedly began telling the board of their own negative experiences with Altman and the \"toxic atmosphere he was creating.\" This included allegations of lying and manipulation, backed up screenshots of conversations and other documentation. \"They used the phrase 'psychological abuse,' telling us they didn't think he was the right person to lead the company to [artificial general intelligence], telling us they had no belief that he either could or would change, no point in giving him feedback, no point in trying to work through these issues,\" said Toner. OpenAI CEO accused of retaliation against critics Toner further addressed the loud outcry from OpenAI employees against Altman's firing. Many made social media posts in support of the ousted CEO, while over 500 of the company's 700 employees stated they would quit if he was not reinstated. According to Toner, staff were led to believe the false dichotomy that if Altman did not return \"immediately, with no accountability [and a] totally new board of his choosing,\" OpenAI would be destroyed. \"I get why not wanting the company to be destroyed got a lot of people to fall in line, whether because they were in some cases about to make a lot of money from this upcoming tender offer, or just because they love their team, they didn't want to lose their job, they cared about the work they're doing,\" said Toner. \"And of course, a lot of people didn't want the company to fall apart, us included.\" She also claimed that fear of retribution for opposing Altman may have contributed to the support he received from OpenAI's staff. \"They had experienced him retaliate against people, retaliate against them for past instances of being critical,\" Toner said. \"They were really afraid of what might happen to them. So when some employees started to say, 'wait, I don't want the company to fall apart, like, let's bring back Sam,' it was very hard for those people who had had terrible experiences to actually say that for fear that if Sam did stay in power as he ultimately did, that would make their lives miserable.\" Finally, Toner noted Altman's turbulent work history, which initially emerged after his failed firing from OpenAI. Pointing to reports that Altman was fired from his previous role at Y Combinator due to his alleged self-interested behaviour, Toner claimed that OpenAI was far from the only company to have the same problems with him. \"And then at his job before that \u2014 which was his only other job in Silicon Valley, his startup Loopt \u2014 apparently the management team went to the board there twice and asked the board to fire him for what they called 'deceptive and chaotic behaviour,'\" Toner continued. \"If you actually look at his track record, he doesn't exactly have a glowing trail of references. This wasn't a problem specific to the personalities on the board, as much as he would love to kind of portray it that way.\" Toner and McCauley are far from the only OpenAI alumni who have expressed misgivings about Altman's leadership. Lead safety researcher Jan Leike resigned earlier this month, citing disagreements with management's priorities and arguing that OpenAI should be more focused on issues such as security, safety, and societal impact. (Chief scientist and former board member Sutskever also resigned, though he cited his desire to work on a personal project.) In response, Altman and president Greg Brockman defended OpenAI's approach to safety. The company also announced this week that Altman would lead OpenAI's new safety and security team.

Toner also said Altman did not tell the board he owned the OpenAI startup fund.

She said that, in October, a month before the ousting, the board had conversations with two executives who relayed experiences with Altman they weren't comfortable sharing before, including screenshots and documentation of problematic interactions and mistruths. \"The two of them suddenly started telling us... how they couldn't trust him, about the toxic atmosphere he was creating,\" Toner said. \"They used the phrase 'psychological abuse,' telling us they didn't think he was the right person to lead the company to AGI, telling us they had no belief that he could or would change.\" Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a broad term that refers to a type of artificial intelligence that outperforms human abilities on various cognitive tasks. An OpenAI spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Earlier this month, OpenAI disbanded its team focused on the long-term risks of AI a year after the company announced the group. The news came days after both team leaders, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, announced their departures from the Microsoft-backed startup. Leike, who has since announced he is joining AI competitor Anthropic, wrote on Friday that OpenAI's \"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\" Toner's comments and the high-profile departures follow last year's leadership crisis. In November, OpenAI's board ousted Altman, saying it had conducted \"a deliberative review process\" and that Altman \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\" \"The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\" it said. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that while Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that artificial intelligence would not harm humans, others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology. Altman's removal prompted resignations and threats of resignations, including an open letter signed by virtually all of OpenAI's employees, and uproar from investors, including Microsoft. Within a week, Altman was back and board members Toner and Tasha McCauley, who had voted to oust Altman, were out. Sutskever relinquished his seat on the board and remained on staff until he announced his departure on May 14. Adam D'Angelo, who had also voted to oust Altman, remains on the board. In March, OpenAI announced its new board, which includes Altman, and the conclusion of an internal investigation by law firm WilmerHale into the events leading up to Altman's ouster. OpenAI did not publish the WilmerHale investigation report but summarized its findings. \"The review concluded there was a significant breakdown of trust between the prior board and Sam and Greg,\" OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said at the time, referring to president and co-founder Greg Brockman. The review also \"concluded the board acted in good faith... [and] did not anticipate some of the instability that led afterwards,\" Taylor added.", "summary": "Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner said board members learned about ChatGPT from Twitter and didn't know CEO Sam Altman owned the OpenAI startup fund.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/former-openai-board-member-explains-why-ceo-sam-altman-was-fired.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107337921-1700665350774-gettyimages-1705021267-_jj23909_nndjqkyn.jpeg?v=1716993423", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:43:06", "author": "Hayden Field", "authors": ["Hayden Field"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.192}, {"id": 225072912, "title": "Former OpenAI board member reveals why Sam Altman was fired in bombshell interview\u2014\u2018we learned about ChatGPT on Twitter\u2019", "text": "Helen Toner, an AI policy expert from Georgetown University, sat on the nonprofit board that controlled OpenAI from 2021 until she resigned late last year following her role in ousting Altman.

Things ultimately came to a head, Toner said, after she co-published a paper in October of last year that cast Anthropic\u2019s approach to AI safety in a better light than OpenAI, enraging Altman. \u201cThe problem was that after the paper came out Sam started lying to other board members in order to try and push me off the board, so it was another example that just like really damaged our ability to trust him,\u201d she continued, adding that the behavior coincided with discussions in which the board was \u201calready talking pretty seriously about whether we needed to fire him.\u201d But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u2014 Jan Leike (@janleike) May 17, 2024 Taken in isolation, those and other disparaging remarks Toner leveled at Altman could be downplayed as sour grapes from the ringleader of a failed coup. The pattern of dishonesty she described comes, however, on the wings of similarly damaging accusations from a former senior AI safety researcher, Jan Leike, as well as Scarlett Johansson. Attempts to self-regulate doomed to fail The Hollywood actress said Altman approached her with the request to use her voice for its latest flagship product\u2014a ChatGPT voice bot that users can converse with, reminiscent of the fictional character Johansson played in the movie Her. When she refused, she suspects he may have blended part of her voice in, violating her wishes. The company disputes her claims but agreed to pause its use anyway. We\u2019re really grateful to Jan for everything he's done for OpenAI, and we know he'll continue to contribute to the mission from outside.

He left this month, saying it had become clear to him that management had no intention of diverting valuable resources to his team as promised, leaving a scathing rebuke of his former employer behind in his wake. (On Tuesday he joined the same OpenAI rival Toner had praised in October, Anthropic.) Once key members of its AI safety staff had scattered to the wind, OpenAI disbanded the team entirely, unifying control in the hands of Altman and his allies. Whether those in charge of maximizing financial results are best entrusted with implementing guardrails that may prove a commercial hindrance remains to be seen. Although certain staffers were having their doubts, few outside of Leike chose to speak up. Thanks to reporting by Vox earlier this month, it emerged that a key motivating factor behind that silence was an unusual non-disparagement clause that, if broken, would void an employee\u2019s vesting equity in perhaps the hottest startup in the world.

Toner also revealed that Altman had failed to inform the board that he \u201cowned the OpenAI Startup Fund, even though he was constantly claiming to be an independent board member with no financial interest in the company.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s more individual examples and for any individual case, Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous sounding explanation of why it wasn\u2019t a big deal or misinterpreted or whatever,\u201d Toner said. \u201cBut the end effect was that after years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him came to the conclusion that we just couldn\u2019t believe things that Sam was telling us,\u201d she added. The Post reached out to OpenAI for comment. OpenAI board director Bret Taylor pushed back on Toner\u2019s claims in a statement shared with the podcast. The statement noted that the law firm Wilmer Hale had conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding Altman\u2019s firing and cleared him of wrongdoing. \u201cWe are disappointed that Ms. Toner continues to revisit these issues,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOver 95% of employees, including senior leadership, asked for Sam\u2019s reinstatement as CEO and the resignation of the prior board,\u201d the statement added. \u201cOur focus remains on moving forward and pursuing OpenAI\u2019s mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\u201d The previous iteration of OpenAI\u2019s board provided few specifics when it shocked the business world by firing Altman just before Thanksgiving last year, stating only that he was ousted for not being \u201cconsistently candid in his communications.\u201d Altman later returned as CEO following an employee revolt and the reported intervention of key OpenAI investors, including Microsoft. OpenAI eventually unveiled a reconstituted board that included former Twitter executive Bret Taylor, who took over as chairman, as well as ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo. Three board members involved in Altman\u2019s firing \u2014Toner, Tasha McCauley and Ilya Sutskever \u2013 exited when he returned to the CEO seat. Sutskever later resumed work at OpenAI, but left the company for good earlier this month as it dissolved the AI \u201csuper-alignment\u201d safety team he co-led. Jan Leike, who co-led the safety team with Sutskever and has also resigned, claimed in an X thread that safety had \u201ctaken a backseat to shiny products\u201d at OpenAI. OpenAI has since announced a new safety oversight unit that includes Altman. WilmerHale investigators found in March that a \u201cbreakdown in trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman\u201d had caused the turmoil. The firm determined the ousted board members had acted in good faith. Investors said Altman\u2019s firing was not related to concerns about the safety or security of OpenAI\u2019s advanced AI research, nor was it a fight over \u201cthe pace of development, OpenAI\u2019s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cWhen ChatGPT came out, November 2022, the board was not informed in advance about that,\u201d Toner told host Bilawal Sidhu on \"The TED AI Show\" in an episode airing Tuesday. \u201cWe learned about ChatGPT on Twitter.\u201d", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/business/ex-openai-board-member-reveals-why-sam-altman-was-briefly-ousted-as-ceo/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/helen-toner-director-strategy-foundational-82860748.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 15:56:18", "author": "Thomas Barrabi", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.38}, {"id": 225147774, "title": "OpenAI board first learned about ChatGPT from Twitter, according to former member", "text": "In a recent interview on \"The Ted AI Show\" podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner said the OpenAI board was unaware of the existence of ChatGPT until they saw it on Twitter. She also revealed details about the company's internal dynamics and the events surrounding CEO Sam Altman's surprise firing and subsequent rehiring last November. OpenAI released ChatGPT publicly on November 30, 2022, and its massive surprise popularity set OpenAI on a new trajectory, shifting focus from being an AI research lab to a more consumer-facing tech company. \"When ChatGPT came out in November 2022, the board was not informed in advance about that. We learned about ChatGPT on Twitter,\" Toner said on the podcast. Toner's revelation about ChatGPT seems to highlight a significant disconnect between the board and the company's day-to-day operations, bringing new light to accusations that Altman was \"not consistently candid in his communications with the board\" upon his firing on November 17, 2023. Altman and OpenAI's new board later said that the CEO's mismanagement of attempts to remove Toner from the OpenAI board following her criticism of the company's release of ChatGPT played a key role in Altman's firing. \"Sam didn\u2019t inform the board that he owned the OpenAI startup fund, even though he constantly was claiming to be an independent board member with no financial interest in the company on multiple occasions,\" she said. \"He gave us inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place, meaning that it was basically impossible for the board to know how well those safety processes were working or what might need to change.\" Toner also shed light on the circumstances that led to Altman's temporary ousting. She mentioned that two OpenAI executives had reported instances of \"psychological abuse\" to the board, providing screenshots and documentation to support their claims. The allegations made by the former OpenAI executives, as relayed by Toner, suggest that Altman's leadership style fostered a \"toxic atmosphere\" at the company: In October of last year, we had this series of conversations with these executives, where the two of them suddenly started telling us about their own experiences with Sam, which they hadn\u2019t felt comfortable sharing before, but telling us how they couldn\u2019t trust him, about the toxic atmosphere it was creating. They use the phrase \"psychological abuse,\" telling us they didn\u2019t think he was the right person to lead the company, telling us they had no belief that he could or would change, there\u2019s no point in giving him feedback, no point in trying to work through these issues. Despite the board's decision to fire Altman, Altman began the process of returning to his position just five days later after a letter to the board signed by over 700 OpenAI employees. Toner attributed this swift comeback to employees who believed the company would collapse without him, saying they also feared retaliation from Altman if they did not support his return. \"The second thing I think is really important to know, that has really gone under reported is how scared people are to go against Sam,\" Toner said. \"They experienced him retaliate against people retaliating... for past instances of being critical.\" \"They were really afraid of what might happen to them,\" she continued. \"So some employees started to say, you know, wait, I don\u2019t want the company to fall apart. Like, let\u2019s bring back Sam. It was very hard for those people who had had terrible experiences to actually say that... if Sam did stay in power, as he ultimately did, that would make their lives miserable.\" In response to Toner's statements, current OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor provided a statement to the podcast: \"We are disappointed that Miss Toner continues to revisit these issues... The review concluded that the prior board's decision was not based on concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI's finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners.\" Even given that review, Toner's main argument is that OpenAI hasn't been able to police itself despite claims to the contrary. \"The OpenAI saga shows that trying to do good and regulating yourself isn\u2019t enough,\" she said.", "summary": "Helen Toner, center of struggle with Altman, suggests CEO fostered \"toxic atmosphere\" at company.", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/openai-board-only-learned-about-chatgpt-from-twitter-according-to-former-member/", "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/helen_toner-760x380.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 15:54:04", "author": "Benj Edwards", "authors": ["Benj Edwards"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.197}]}, {"news": [{"id": 224802006, "title": "Jenna Ellis Strikes Deal That Suspends Law License for 3 Years in Colorado", "text": "Jenna Ellis has joined other ex-lawyers of Donald Trump in having their law license pulled in their home state, with the Colorado Supreme Court approving a deal Tuesday that will suspend her from practicing law there for three years. It\u2019s the latest fallout from the 2020 election to hit Ellis, who tearfully pleaded guilty in October to a felony in Georgia over her failed efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss there. Those efforts were central to Colorado officials\u2019 attempts to bar Ellis from practicing law in the Centennial State, as Colorado law prohibits attorneys from practicing there while they\u2019re incarcerated or on probation from a criminal conviction.

I just went along with it.\" Ellis admitted that she largely failed to perform due diligence, adding how \"millions have been misled by the cynical 'Stop the Steal' campaign.\" \"Since my involvement in the Trump Campaign's challenges to the election results,\" she wrote, \"I have learned of the bad faith dealing and outright illegality of some actors involved.\" \"For example, I did not know at the time of the campaign's commissioned investigation into the 2020 election results, or that the President was notified in December 2020 that he had lost,\" Ellis continued. \"A lot of new information has come out, which I encourage the public to consider.\" Her lawyer, John Richilano, told The Denver Post that \"unlike others in the Trump orbit,\" Ellis \"stepped forward and took responsibility and told the truth.\" Richilano said Ellis did so \"at considerable personal cost\" and was victim to threatening emails, texts and social media activity \"of the obscene variety.\" Along with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and other co-defendants, Ellis recently pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges accusing each of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona. \"She gratefully accepted suspension of her license, understanding her role and realizing, after the fact, that there was a lot of untruths being advanced on behalf of the former President,\" her attorney says.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5801717013271/2024/upi/ab079c8c4384bb2843d015143fc97eee/v1.5/Ex-Trump-lawyer-Jenna-Ellis-given-3-year-law-license-suspension-in-Colorado.jpg\"> Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis got a three-year law license suspension by Colorado's Supreme Court stemming from the Fulton County indictment in her alleged role in the strategy to reverse 2020's election results.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/05/29/Jenna-Ellis-Colorado-Supreme-Court-suspended-Trump-campaign/5801717013271/", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5801717013271/2024/upi/ab079c8c4384bb2843d015143fc97eee/v1.2/Ex-Trump-lawyer-Jenna-Ellis-given-3-year-law-license-suspension-in-Colorado.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 22:28:52", "author": "Chris Benson", "authors": ["Chris Benson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.421}]}, {"news": [{"id": 224952850, "title": "North Korea flies hundreds of balloons full of trash over South Korea", "text": "North Korea flew hundreds of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea in one of its most bizarre provocations against its rival in years, prompting the South's military to mobilize chemical and explosive response teams to recover objects and debris in different parts of the country.The ballooning campaign came as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged his military scientists to overcome a failed satellite launch and continue developing space-based reconnaissance capabilities, which he described as crucial for countering U.S. and South Korean military activities, state media said Wednesday.In his first public comments about the launch failure, Kim also warned of unspecified \"stern\" action against South Korea over an exercise involving 20 fighter jets near the inter-Korean border hours before North Korea's failed launch on Monday.

In a statement issued over the weekend, North Korean Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il said the North was planning to scatter \u201cmounds of wastepaper and filth\u201d over border areas and other parts of South Korea, in what he described as \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d action against the leafletting by South Korean activists. Later Wednesday, Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader\u2019s powerful sister, took to state media to ridicule a South Korean military statement demanding that the North stop its \u201cinhumane and vulgar activity.\u201d She said the North was merely exercising its freedom of expression, which the Seoul government has stated as a reason for its inability to stop anti-North Korean activists from flying leaflets across the border. \u201cOnce you experience how nasty and exhausting it feels to go around picking up dirty filth, you will realize that you shouldn\u2019t talk about freedom of expression so easily when it comes to (leafletting) in border areas,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make it clear that we will respond with tens more times the amount of filth to what the (South Koreans) spray to us in the future.\u201d Photos released by the South Korean military showed trash scattered across highways and roads in different parts of the country. In the capital, Seoul, military officials found what appeared to be a timer that was likely designed to pop the bags of trash midair. In the central South Chungcheong province, two huge balloons carrying an un-popped plastic bag filled with dirt-like substances were seen at a road. There were no immediate reports of damage caused by the balloons. Similar North Korean balloon activities damaged cars and other property in 2016. Kim Jong Un\u2019s comments about the satellite were from a speech at the North\u2019s Academy of Defense Sciences, which he visited a day after a rocket carrying what would have been his country\u2019s second military reconnaissance satellite exploded shortly after liftoff. North Korea\u2019s aerospace technology administration said the explosion was possibly related to the reliability of a newly developed rocket engine that is fueled by petroleum and uses liquid oxygen as an oxidizer. Animosities between the Koreas are at their worst level in years as the pace of both Kim\u2019s weapons demonstrations and South Korea\u2019s combined military exercises with the U.S. and Japan have intensified since 2022. The failed satellite launch was a setback to Kim\u2019s plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 after North Korea\u2019s first military reconnaissance satellite was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed attempts. Monday\u2019s launch drew criticism from South Korea, Japan and the United States, because the United Nations bans North Korea from conducting any such rocket launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it perceives as U.S.-led military threats. Kim has described spy satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat posed by his nuclear-capable missiles. \u201cAlthough we failed to achieve the results we had hoped to get in the recent reconnaissance satellite launch, we must never feel scared or dispirited but make still greater efforts,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt is natural that one learns more and makes greater progress after experiencing failure.\u201d North Korea hasn\u2019t commented on when it would be ready to attempt a satellite launch again, which some experts say could take months. State media\u2019s mention of a liquid oxygen-petroleum rocket engine suggests the North is trying to develop a more powerful space launch vehicle that could handle larger payloads, according to some South Korean experts. It is believed that North Korea\u2019s previous space rockets used unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine as fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizer. The country\u2019s swift transition in space rocket designs possibly indicates external technological help, which would likely come from Russia, said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea\u2019s Research Institute for National Strategy. Kim has been boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in recent months, highlighted by a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September, as they align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington. Kim\u2019s meeting with Putin was held at a spaceport in the Russian Far East and came after North Korea\u2019s consecutive failures in its attempts to launch its first spy satellite. Putin then told Russian reporters that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites. The U.S. and South Korea have also accused North Korea of providing Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other military equipment to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine. ___ Follow AP\u2019s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific", "summary": "By KIM TONG-HYUNG (Associated Press) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) &#8212; North Korea flew hundreds of balloons carrying trash and manure toward South Korea in one of its most bizarre provocations against its rival in years, prompting the South&#8217;s military to mobilize chemical and explosive response teams to recover objects and debris in different parts of [&#8230;]", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/28/north-korea-flies-trash-balloons-over-the-south-as-leader-kim-doubles-down-on-satellite-ambitions/", "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/North_Korea_77194.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 16:08:03", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.049}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225025212, "title": "Shocking Trade Ideas Patriots Should Pursue Before 2024 Season", "text": "Smith-Schuster's spot on the depth chart is under threat.

It's understandable. They've done a great job of drafting and developing cornerbacks and they have young options ready to fill the gap. At least, that's the story they are telling so far. June 1 is an important date in the NFL offseason because it changes how dead cap charges work. Players traded or cut after the date have their dead cap charges spread out instead of the whole charge coming off the books at once. It's especially notable with how some contracts have been structured. For instance, the latest restructure for the Saints Marshon Lattimore includes a guaranteed option bonus that would allow the Saints to minimize their dead cap charge to just $10-13 million in dead money, per Tony Catalina of Pro Football Network. That feels like a move that you only put into a contract if you're thinking about trading away a player. Lattimore has dealt with injuries lately but is still capable of good production as a starter.

Kennedy Jr. campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission claiming that CNN, President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump and their election committees colluded to exclude Kennedy from a planned June 27 televised debate.The complaint, filed Tuesday and addressed to FEC Acting General Counsel Lisa Stevenson, accuses the parties of designing criteria \"to result in the selection of certain pre-chosen participants, namely Biden and Trump, in a clear breach of federal campaign finance law.\"The complaint introduces an element of doubt as to whether the debate\u2014scheduled to take place at CNN's studio in Atlanta\u2014can legally take place if Kennedy is excluded, given it could be interpreted as campaign contributions to Biden and Trump, according to Kennedy's attorneys.The letter notes that The Washington Post reported that \"Biden advisers quickly let it be known that they had not agreed to any terms that could include Kennedy\" and also that CNN producers promised Trump aides that \"RFK will not be on the stage.\"The complaint also says that Biden's Committee wrote a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates saying \"the debates should be one-on-one,\" even though both Biden and Trump have been \"working around the Commission\" in favor of allowing CNN to host.Also, the complaint notes, \"CNN, itself, reported that the Trump Committee would not agree to a debate including Candidate Kennedy,\" and it reported that \"calling for earlier debates might also help weed out third-party candidates that could cause problems for both Trump and Biden.\"If CNN goes through with the debate without Kennedy, then it is \"making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and the Biden Committee and the Trump Committee have accepted these prohibited corporate contributions,\" according to the complaint.While there are certain exceptions allowing for the media to carry news or commentary that benefit one candidate over others, CNN does not qualify if it is staging a debate, the lawyers contend. \"Therefore, any cost CNN has incurred and will incur to stage the debate is a contribution,\" they write.The complaint asks that the FEC \"enjoin the Parties from holding the presidential debate\" unless CNN, Trump and Biden comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act, and that it impose a monetary penalty against those who, in the view of Kennedy's attorneys, have yet to do so.Debates hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates typically are staged in September and October, hence CNN's debate scheduled this month is legally problematic, according to Kennedy's team.The complaint claims that CNN's rules are \"a poorly constructed pretext because Biden and Trump do not and will not qualify under these terms.\"The most prominent issue addressed is that, among CNN's criteria to qualify for inclusion in its debate is that a candidate's name appears on enough ballots to garner 270 electoral votes.\"To appear on the state ballots, President Biden and Mr. Trump must first be nominated by their respective parties,\" claim the attorneys. \"President Biden is seeking the Democratic Party nomination, but his party has not nominated him. Mr. Trump is seeking the Republican Party nomination, but his party has not nominated him.\"Official nominations occur during party conventions, the Republicans in July and the Democrats in August. The attorneys who filed the complaint argue that before those conventions, neither Trump's nor Biden's names would officially appear on any ballot. The Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday plans to hold a virtual roll call ahead of Ohio's August 7 ballot deadline, but it's unclear if it would happen prior to the debate.While Biden, Trump and CNN did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment, CNN previously told Newsweek that Kennedy doesn't yet qualify because \"the mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state.\"The network also said that Biden and Trump qualify under its rules because nearly every state \"provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning.\"The criteria also involve polling at above 15 percent in four polls that meet CNN's standards by June 20. On May 11, CNN reported that Kennedy polled at 16 percent in a CNN/SSRS poll.CNN's approved polls include those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.In the meantime, Kennedy has challenged Biden and Trump to debate him on X, formerly known as Twitter. Kennedy first floated the idea two weeks ago. Though neither of the presumptive nominees have accepted the challenge yet, Elon Musk has indicated a willingness to host a debate on his platform.\"X is where the debate should be. The new public square with 100x the audience of CNN,\" the candidate posted on May 22. \"@realDonaldTrump, I know you've got the guts to do it. Do you want to call @POTUS or should I?\"", "summary": "CNN has colluded with Biden and Trump to exclude Kennedy and is therefore violating campaign laws, according to attorneys.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-files-fec-complaint-demanding-inclusion-cnn-debate-1905567", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400237/presidential-candidate-robert-f-kennedy-jr.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 10:00:07", "author": "Paul Bond", "authors": ["Paul Bond"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.266}, {"id": 225172608, "title": "RFK Jr. files FEC complaint claiming CNN, Biden, and Trump engaged in &#8216;flagrant violations&#8217; in planning debates", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed a new complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that CNN collaborated with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude the third-party candidate from a June 27 debate. In the complaint filed on Tuesday, Kennedy alleged the entities colluded to prepare debate criteria \u201cthat were designed to result in the selection of certain pre-chosen participants, namely Biden and Trump, in a clear breach of federal campaign finance law.\u201d The Kennedy campaign pointed to a Washington Post story earlier this month that alleges Biden advisers told CNN the president would only participate in a one-on-one debate with Trump next month in Atlanta, Georgia, a factor that would exclude Kennedy. The story also alleges that a Trump campaign official was told by a CNN producer that \u201cRFK will not be on the stage.\u201d A \u201cBiden Committee\u201d letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates pushing for a one-on-one debate with former President Donald Trump was also cited in the complaint. President Joe Biden and Trump bypassed the Commission on Presidential Debates to appear in the CNN debate next month and an ABC News debate in September. These actions, according to the Kennedy campaign, violate the Federal Election Campaign Act. \u201cCNN is making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and the Biden Committee and the Trump Committee have accepted these prohibited corporate contributions,\u201d the complaint states. CNN\u2019s qualification criteria for the debate include a candidate gaining enough access to state ballots to reach the 270-electoral-vote threshold by June 20 and receiving at least 15% in four national polls conducted by one of at least 12 selected pollsters of registered or likely voters. Kennedy claimed he gained access to nine state ballots \u2014 California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah \u2014 totaling 171 electoral votes. But Kennedy has only met three of the four national polls needed to qualify for the debate: a Marquette Law School poll with the third-party candidate at 17%, a CNN poll with him at 16%, and a Quinnipiac poll with him at 16%. In a statement to the Washington Examiner, CNN pushed back against the collusion allegations. \u201cThe law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said. \u201cAs the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK, Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\u201d Biden and Trump have not technically been selected by their parties to be the presidential nominees. That will happen in July for Trump at the Republican National Convention and on June 4 for Biden during a virtual nomination process scheduled to comply with an Aug. 7 ballot deadline. But both candidates are the presumptive nominees after surpassing the delegate threshold and are generally considered to be on the ballot in all 50 states by the November election. Kennedy\u2019s complaint asks the FEC to block the debate from happening on June 27 \u201cuntil the Parties have come into compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act.\u201d Eligibility for the debate opened on March 13 and closes on June 20, seven days before the debate, meaning Kennedy still has time to attempt to qualify. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Biden and Trump have attempted to downplay Kennedy\u2019s chances of spoiling the election. It is unclear whose candidacy he would hurt the most, but Democrats have created teams to counter Kennedy, fearing a 2016 reprise of Jill Stein playing spoiler to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Trump campaign did not respond to the Washington Examiner\u2019s request for comment.

The bill calls for the banning of bullfights in a three-year span, making the tradition illegal by the start of 2028. The new law now needs to be signed by President Gustavo Petro, who has been a longtime opponent of these events. Bullfighting originated in the Iberian Peninsula and is still legal in a handful of countries, including Spain, France, Portugal, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico. EXPEDITION TO 'HOLY GRAIL' SHIPWRECK FULL OF GOLD, EMERALDS BEGINS IN CARIBBEAN SEA It was once a popular event, broadcast live by multiple television networks. But the tradition has come under increased scrutiny as views change about animal welfare, and many find it unacceptable to see an animal suffer for entertainment's sake. \"This ban is a huge victory for organizations that have worked to transform society and reject violence against animals,\" said Terry Hurtado, an animal rights activist and city council member in Cali, who has been leading protests against bullfights since the 1990s. \"I feel relieved that bulls and horses (which also participate in some bullfights) in Colombia will no longer be tortured, and that children will no longer be exposed to this spectacle.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In bullfights, a matador faces bulls that are bred to be aggressive. The matador taunts the bull with a red cape and kills the animal with the blow of a sword after it has been injured with lances and daggers, and is tired of charging at the matador in a circular arena. In Colombia, where bullfights have been held since colonial times, less than two dozen municipalities continue to hold these events, although the annual bullfights in the city of Manizales still draw tens of thousands of spectators. Bullfighting aficionados described the ban as an assault on the freedoms of minorities as well as a problem for cities where these events draw thousands of visitors.", "summary": "Colombia\u2019s congress has voted to ban bullfights, which have become increasingly controversial, in a three-year span, and will make the tradition illegal by the start of 2028.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/colombias-congress-votes-ban-bullfighting", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/931/523/Colombia-Bullfighting.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 11:03:56", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.11}, {"id": 224981476, "title": "Colombia congress passes bill banning bullfighting", "text": "Colombia's congress passed a bill Tuesday banning bullfighting, a controversial yet popular pastime in the South American country with hundreds of events drawing thousands of spectators every year. Leftist President Gustavo Petro, who must approve the step, praised lawmakers for ensuring \"death is not a spectacle\" with a post on X. The lower house gave the bill the green light with a 93-2 vote, backing a bullfighting ban from 2027. The law would bring Colombia in line with other countries in the region that have banned bullfighting, including Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Guatemala. Leading up to 2027, the state would be required to help find alternative employment options for the tens of thousands of people estimated to depend directly or indirectly on bullfighting for their income. It would also have to adapt the country's arenas for other sporting and cultural activities. Lawmaker and environmentalist Juan Carlos Losada described the move as a \"historical milestone\". Colombia will leave the \"sad list\" of countries \"where bullfighting, which is animal torture, is still considered a cultural institution,\" he told AFP. In 2018, the Constitutional Court recognized bullfights as part of Colombia's cultural tradition. But the capital Bogota -- one of the oldest bullfighting cities in the Americas -- since outlawed the injuring or killing of bulls, removing the goriest part of the spectacle in what it hoped would eventually bring an end to the blood sport. - 'A symbol of identity' - The city of Medellin has also imposed restrictions, but bullfighting remains popular in cities like Cali and Manizales. Colombia is one of only eight countries in the world where bullfights are still held -- which are Ecuador, France, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain and Venezuela. In Ecuador's capital Quito, it is prohibited to kill the bull. In Mexico, an estimated 40,000 spectators filled the largest bullring in the world in January after the Supreme Court revoked a suspension on the practice. The Colombian legislation was tabled in 2020 during the presidency of right-winger Ivan Duque, but the vote was postponed. Lawmakers backing the ban argued that bullfighting represents one of the most controversial elements of Spanish colonialism, while the practice is against constitutional rights to a healthy environment, human dignity and the recognition of animals as sentient beings due protection. The parliamentary vote was preceded by a debate which included mayors, representatives from the livestock sector, bullfight organizers and multiple animal rights groups. Bullfighter Johan Andres Paloma, 22, told AFP ahead of the vote that he was \"proud\" of his calling, which he described as \"a symbol of identity\" for many Colombians. Paloma said 35,000 people depend directly on the bullfights, without counting those employed indirectly or informally in the sector. According to the bullfighter, there are some 300 events held annually at around 70 locations in Colombia.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/bullfighting.jpg?id=29403749&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C8%2C0%2C9\"/><br/><br/><p>Colombia's congress passed a bill Tuesday banning bullfighting, a controversial yet popular pastime in the South American country with hundreds of events drawing thousands of spectators every year.</p><p>Leftist President <a href=\"https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Gustavo%20Petro\" target=\"_blank\">Gustavo Petro</a>, who must approve the step, praised lawmakers for ensuring \"death is not a spectacle\" with a post on X.</p><p>The lower house gave the bill the green light with a 93-2 vote, backing a bullfighting ban from 2027.</p><p>The law would bring Colombia in line with other countries in the region that have banned bullfighting, including Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Guatemala.</p><p>Leading up to 2027, the state would be required to help find alternative employment options for the tens of thousands of people estimated to depend directly or indirectly on bullfig", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/colombia-congress-passes-bill-banning-bullfighting/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/bullfighting.jpg?id=29403749&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C32%2C0%2C33", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 11:13:09", "author": "Agence France-presse", "authors": ["Agence France-presse"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.0}]}, {"news": [{"id": 224821160, "title": "Karl-Anthony Towns propels Timberwolves past Mavericks in Game 4 to avoid sweep", "text": "DALLAS \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns scored 20 of his 25 points in the second half and the Minnesota Timberwolves held off the Dallas Mavericks 105-100 on Tuesday night to avoid a sweep in the Western Conference finals.

The question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. Western leaders have mostly shrunk from taking the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West\u2019s direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. But the war has been going Russia\u2019s way recently as the Kremlin\u2019s forces have exploited Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid and Western Europe\u2019s inadequate military production slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield. Russian missiles and bombs have smashed into Ukrainian military positions and civilian areas, including the power grid. Kyiv is facing its hardest test of the war, and untying its hands on long-range weapons could spur a fightback and upset the Kremlin. Macron said France\u2019s position is that \u201cwe think we must allow (Ukraine) to neutralize the (Russian) military sites from which the missiles are fired.\u201d \u201cIf we tell (the Ukrainians) you do not have the right to reach the point from which the missiles are fired, we are in fact telling them that we are delivering weapons to you but you cannot defend yourself,\u201d Macron said late Tuesday on an official visit to Germany. His remarks came a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged the alliance\u2019s members to lift some of the restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of Western weapons. \u201cThe right to self-defense includes hitting legitimate targets outside Ukraine,\u201d Stoltenberg said at a NATO meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria on Monday. Already, at the start of May, Moscow interpreted as a threat U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron\u2019s comment that Ukraine could use British long-range weapons, such as the Storm Shadow cruise missile, to hit back at Russia. That, and Macron\u2019s comments that he doesn\u2019t exclude sending troops to Ukraine, prompted Russia to announce it would hold drills involving tactical nuclear weapons. Russia also warned London that its decision could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere. The leaders are choosing their words carefully. Macron underlined that only Russian bases used to launch missiles against Ukraine should be regarded as legitimate targets \u2014 not other Russian bases or civilian infrastructure. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking alongside Macron, was as usual more guarded and noncommittal, noting that under international law Ukraine \u201cis allowed to defend itself.\u201d Scholz has insisted on avoiding steps that could end up drawing NATO into a battlefield confrontation with Russia. Other Western leaders have expressed similar fears of a creeping, high-stakes escalation. His concerns are shared in Washington. The U.S. has over the past two years gradually ceded to Ukrainian requests for support, sending tanks and long-range missile systems that it initially hesitated to provide, but with a caveat on aiming at Russian soil. \u201cThere\u2019s no change to our policy at this point,\u201d U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t encourage or enable the use of U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.\u201d Western leaders are keen to put pressure on Putin, whose forces have recently been pushing hard against Ukrainian defenses in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. This week has brought a cascade of new European aid, with Belgium and Spain each pledging around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in new military support to Ukraine. Sweden announced Wednesday it will donate a aid worth 13 billion kronor ($1.23 billion) \u2014 the largest package Sweden has so far donated. It will include air defense systems, artillery ammunition and armored vehicles. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3J1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLXdhci1tYWNyb24td2VhcG9ucy1lMzA4NzU1YTMxNzE2ZWUwMTIzYjQ0MWJiOWI1NDhiMNIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">France's Macron urges a green light for Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with Western weapons</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-macron-weapons-e308755a31716ee0123b441bb9b548b0", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/170f377/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7745x4357+0+403/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6c%2Fed%2F49ebdd40f9f42fed4f0d25cf5b8d%2F75f52d76b33b45b48a916c712325b108", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 11:24:00", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.077}, {"id": 225068038, "title": "France's Macron Urges a Green Light for Ukraine to Strike Targets Inside Russia with Western Weapons", "text": "Western countries should let Ukraine strike military bases inside Russia with the sophisticated long-range weapons they are providing to Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said, pressuring his allies in the most recent sign of a potentially significant policy shift that could help change the complexion of the war.

The question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Western leaders have mostly shrunk from taking the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West\u2019s direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. But the war has been going Russia\u2019s way recently as the Kremlin\u2019s forces have exploited Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, and Western Europe\u2019s inadequate military production slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield.

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Mr. Macron noted that Russian forces have launched missiles from within their internationally-recognized territory, which have then flown across the border into Ukraine\u2019s eastern Kharkiv region. Mr. Macron said Ukraine must therefore be able to strike inside Russia to stop these types of attacks. \u201cWe think we must allow (Ukraine) to neutralize the (Russian) military sites from which the missiles are fired, but not other civilian or military targets,\u201d the French president said. Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks come as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has increasingly signaled support for NATO members to give Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy their blessing to use NATO-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia. \u201cThe time has come for allies to consider whether they should lift some of the restrictions they have put on the use of weapons they have donated to Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in a May 25 interview with The Economist. \u201cEspecially now when a lot of the fighting is going on in Kharkiv, close to the border, to deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves.\u201d Addressing the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on Monday, Mr. Stoltenberg again offered his support for Ukrainian forces to strike inside Russia\u2019s borders. While standing beside his French counterpart on Tuesday, Mr. Scholz avoided expressing outright support or opposition to Ukrainian strikes inside Russia. \u201cIncluding inside Russia?\u201d the Reuters journalist again asked, to which Mr. Cameron replied, \u201cWell it\u2019s, that\u2019s a decision for Ukraine, and Ukraine has that right.\u201d By contrast, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her government have distanced themselves from Mr. Stoltenberg\u2019s calls for NATO to support Ukrainian strikes inside Russia. During a May 15 visit to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. government has not \u201cencouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine.\u201d However, Mr. Blinken left some room for Ukraine to decide for itself whether such strikes are prudent. \u201cUltimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it\u2019s going to conduct this war, a war it\u2019s conducting in defense of its freedom, of its sovereignty, of its territorial integrity,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cWe will continue to back Ukraine with the equipment that it needs to succeed, that it needs to win.\u201d In a May 19 interview with ABC News, former U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said that with the recent Russian offensive around Kharkiv, the time had come for the Biden administration to change its tune and allow strikes on military bases inside Russia. Asked to address Ms. Nulands remarks in the ABC News interview, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a May 20 Pentagon press conference that the Ukrainian military\u2019s focus \u201cought to be on the close fight.\u201d Moments later, Mr. Austin added that the United States expects Ukrainian forces to use U.S.-supplied weapons \u201con targets inside of Ukraine\u201d but said \u201cthe aerial dynamic\u2019s a little bit different\u201d and that he'd \u201cleave it up to the experts\u201d to decide what to do. Last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) also appeared to throw his support behind allowing Ukrainian forces to use U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia\u2019s borders, telling a Voice of America reporter, \u201cI think we need to allow Ukraine to prosecute the war the way they see fit\u201d and \u201cI think us trying to micromanage the effort there it\u2019s not a good policy for us.\u201d Despite the growing domestic and international pressure, the Biden administration insisted it still won\u2019t permit Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons inside Russia. Addressing reporters at a press conference while visiting Uzbekistan on Tuesday, Mr. Putin said the Russian side is monitoring the comments and behavior of NATO members \u201cvery carefully.\u201d The Russian president further asserted that certain long-range missile systems like the Franco-British-designed Storm Shadow cruise missile and the U.S.-designed Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) are reliant on space-based targeting support provided to Ukrainian forces by NATO member nations. He suggested such targeting assistance closely implicates these NATO nations in any strikes on Russian territory. \u201cTargets are identified and automatically communicated to the relevant crews that may not even realise what exactly they are putting in. A crew, maybe even a Ukrainian crew, then puts in the corresponding launch mission,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cHowever, the mission is put together by representatives of NATO countries, not the Ukrainian military.\u201d The Russian president went on to say that NATO members therefore \u201cshould be fully aware of what is at stake,\u201d adding, \u201cThey should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told Russian broadcaster Izvetsia on Tuesday that Russia would prepare countermeasures if European Union member nations decide as a group to lift restrictions on Ukrainian attacks within Russia\u2019s borders.", "summary": "'We think we must allow (Ukraine) to neutralize the (Russian) military sites from which the missiles are fired,' French President Emmanuel Macron said.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/frances-macron-backs-ukrainian-strikes-inside-russia-5658960", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/09/16/id5492567-emmanuel-macron-300x180.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 17:19:05", "author": "Ryan Morgan", "authors": ["Ryan Morgan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.234}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225155738, "title": "JD Vance Calls for Federal Investigation into Judge Juan Merchan&#8217;s &#8216;Conduct&#8217; in Trump Trial", "text": "Sen.

Vance (@JDVance1) May 29, 2024 \u201cThese statutes would seem to have quite a lot to say about the conduct of Juan Merchan, the New York trial judge and Democratic political donor who has set up a kangaroo court for Donald Trump in Manhattan,\u201d he wrote. The Department of Justice notes that Section 242 \u201cmakes it a crime for someone acting under color of law to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d \u201cIt is not necessary that the offense be motivated by racial bias or by any other animus,\u201d it adds. Vance cites the sweeping gag order Merchan has imposed on Trump in the trial as a potential violation of this section. The order prevents him from publicly discussing witnesses regarding their participation in the trial or investigation. This includes Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. It also bars him from speaking publicly about District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s staff or the court\u2019s staff, family members of either staff, and counsel in the case other than Bragg \u201cif those statements are made with the intent to materially interfere with, or to cause others to materially interfere with, counsel\u2019s or staffs work in this criminal case.\u201d Vance said Merchan has placed this order \u201con the protected speech of a former president who is now leading presidential polling of the next election.\u201d Trump currently leads President Joe Biden 47.5 percent to 46.4 percent in the RealClearPolling average as of Wednesday. WATCH \u2014 Legal Analyst Zelin: Prosecution \u201cFell Way Short\u201d Of Proving Case Against Trump: \u201cOn Merchan\u2019s orders, a Republican presidential candidate has been made powerless to question the credibility of the witnesses testifying against him, the motivations of the prosecutors pursuing him, or the impartiality of the apparently conflicted judge fining him,\u201d he added. Vance wrote this \u201cwould be disfavored in best of circumstances\u201d and cited late Supreme Court Justice William Brennan Jr. and other liberal justices\u2019 previous denunciations of gag orders WATCH \u2014 Sen. Tim Scott: D.A. Bragg Is Guilty of \u201cTrying to Frame\u201d Trump The senator argued that Merchan has \u201cdone his best\u201d to also \u201cdeprive\u201d Trump of an impartial jury and that the judge has been \u201cshameless\u201d regarding the \u201cadmission and exclusion of evidence.\u201d According to Vance: Merchan has not been content to deprive President Trump of only his First Amendment rights, either. As a criminal defendant, President Trump is entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury\u2026 \u2014 Merchan has done his best to deprive Trump of both. During jury selection, Merchan refused to dismiss prospective jurors with obvious bias. One had scoffed on social media that \u201cRepublicans\u2026 [were] projected to pick up 70 seats in prison.\u201d\u2026 Another posted a video on social media showing her participation in an anti-Trump street demonstration\u2026 But Merchan was willing to impanel them anyway, forcing President Trump\u2019s attorneys to burn critical peremptory strikes\u2026 When it comes to the admission and exclusion of evidence, Merchan has been just as shameless. He has bent over backwards to allow the prosecution to introduce whatever evidence it wants, e.g., by allowing a prosecution witness to testify at length about the alleged details of an unproven sexual episode with no relevance to the underlying charges\u2026 But he has taken a strong hand against defense evidence at every opportunity. Vance pointed to \u201ca possible conspiracy under Section 241\u201d of Title 18, adding that \u201cthere are many likely coconspirators to consider,\u201d including Merchan\u2019s daughter, Loren Merchan, Bragg, and other prosecutors. The senator noted that Loren Merchan is a \u201cfundraiser for Democratic officials and organizations and she helped her clients raise $93 million from donors during Trump\u2019s trial in New York, partly by invoking the case and smearing the defendant in solicitation emails.\u201d He added that Bragg and his prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo and Christopher Conroy, have repeatedly requested Merchan to \u201cdeprive Trump of his First Amendment rights.\u201d Vance requested a response from Garland by June 28 regarding whether or not he would open an investigation. If he chooses not, the senator asks that he issue a document-retention request that would enable a future administration to open the case.", "summary": "<p>Sen. J.D.

The court appearance comes more than a month after Weinstein's rape and sexual assault convictions in New York State were overturned on April 25. Weinstein, a once-prominent Hollywood producer, was found guilty in February 2020 of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape in a New York City courtroom, the New York Times reported at the time. He was subsequently sentenced to 23 years in prison. Those convictions were overturned after the New York Court of Appeals, in a 4-3 decision, held that trial judge James Burke erred in allowing three women whose allegations were not a part of the criminal case against Weinstein to testify against him.

He was sentenced to an additional 16 years in prison at the time, the Los Angeles Times previously reported.

Nicole Blumberg said in New York criminal court Wednesday. A July 9 hearing was set for purposes of discovery and compliance. Blumberg disclosed this as she mentioned a letter filed with Judge Curtis Farber asking the judge to direct Weinstein\u2019s defense counsel to refrain from making public statements about witnesses, for fear of scaring off the additional women who may now bring claims. The attorney, Arthur Aidala, had held a press conference outside of the courtroom May 1, after the first hearing in the case, in which he called into question statements made by Miriam Haley, who brought claims against Weinstein in the first trial. Weinstein was in attendance Wednesday and was brought into the room in a wheelchair, wearing a blue suit, with a large book on his lap. Aidala said he felt it was his duty to speak up for Weinstein in the press conference, but was aware of his ethical obligations. \u201cI will make sure that I don\u2019t get so close to that line again,\u201d he said. In court, Aidala also repeatedly objected to the use of the word \u201csurvivor\u201d by the prosecutors, as they mentioned the new claimants. After hearing both parties, Farber directed both sides not to pander to the press. The New York State Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein\u2019s rape conviction from 2020. The court ruled the judge in the New York County trial prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings and allowed women to testify about allegations that were not part of the case. Following that decision, the Manhattan DA\u2019s office said they would pursue a new trial, with Assistant D.A. Nicole Blumberg reiterating in a May 1 court hearing that prosecutors wanted to retry the case \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d and that it \u201cremains a strong case.\u201d In a press conference the day the conviction was overturned, Aidala said Weinstein continues to maintain his innocence and suggested he would take the stand in the new trial. During the May 1 hearing, his attorney, Arthur Aidala said Weinstein continued to suffer from \u201cvery, very serious medical issues\u201d physically, but remained mentally sharp. During the trial in February 2020, Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault in the first degree, based on the testimony of Haley, a former Project Runway production assistant, and rape in the third degree, based on the testimony of aspiring actress Jessica Mann. He was acquitted on three other charges, and was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Mann attended the first hearing, which prosecutors pointed to saying, \u201cShe\u2019s not backing down and is committed to seeing that justice is served yet again.\u201d Haley\u2019s attorney Gloria Allred was also in attendance. Weinstein was also convicted by a Los Angeles jury in 2022 on three counts against Jane Doe No. 1, who has since come forward as former Russian model Evgeniya Chernyshova. That 16-year prison sentence still stands, however his attorneys there have indicated they would try to appeal that sentence, in light of the New York case being overturned.

Judge Merchan even had the gag order against the former president expanded to include his daughter and other family members because Mr. Trump kept railing against them on social media. Mr. Vance said members of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office have also been \u201cplausible co-conspirators.\u201d \u201cAfter all, they have repeatedly urged Merchan to deprive President Trump of his First Amendment rights in court filings and oral advocacy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne can only wonder what sort of ex parte communications might have led Merchan to so enthusiastically embrace a prior restraint on speech that he would have known to be repugnant to the Constitution.\u201d Mr. Trump is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his supporters have railed against the case from the start, calling it election interference since his appearance in court keeps him from the campaign trail. Mr. Vance joined other Trump supporters in Congress in visiting the former president in the Manhattan courtroom this month in a show of solidarity.

Prices are dropping immediately on more than 1,500 items online and at its stores, which include both name and store brands, Walgreens announced Wednesday. In the past few weeks, competitors including Target, Walmart and Amazon slashed prices on thousands of household goods to rev up consumer spending. For example, an 80-count One A Day gummy vitamins jar now cost $11.99, down from $13.49 and the price of a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips from the Walgreens-owned Nice! brand now costs $1.99, down from $2.79. For kids, the price of a 16-inch Squishmallow plush has gone from $24.99 to $20. \u201cWalgreens understands our customers are under financial strain and struggle to purchase everyday essentials,\u201d said Tracey D. Brown, Walgreens\u2019 retail president and chief customer officer, in a release. \u201cWe continue to be committed to our customers by lowering prices on over a thousand additional items, something we\u2019ve been doing since October of 2023.\u201d Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s most recent earnings report, released in March, revealed that the retailers\u2019 second-quarter sales beat expectations, but lowered its full-year earnings outlook because of a \u201cchallenging retail environment in the US.\u201d Shares are down 40% year to date and its next earnings report isn\u2019t expected until June. Meanwhile, a host of other retailers report earnings Thursday, including Dollar General and Costco. Shoppers\u2019 savings A number of big retailers are lowering prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts andcrafts or hobby kits. Retailers are feeling jittery after they hiked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren\u2019t shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it\u2019s the stores that finally appear to be yielding. That presents an ongoing challenge for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending. Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings. This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. \u201cThere\u2019s just less dollars for consumers to spend,\u201d Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added. The-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Target said earlier this month that it planned to lower prices on nearly 5,000 everyday items by the summer, noting that it had already reduced prices on 1,500 items including milk, soda, and paper towels.

Walmart, on the other hand, posted better-than-expected quarterly profits, with much of its growth was due to the popularity of its e-commerce site as well as spending by wealthy customers. The Arkansas-based retail giant said earlier this month it was lowering costs on some items by as much as 45%. Markdowns include a 28-ounce can of Bush\u2019s baked beans, slashed to $2.22 from $2.48, and a 24-pack of 12-ounce Diet Coke priced at $12.78 versus $14.28 previously. Low- and middle-income Americans have become more frugal during the past year, prompting companies such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s and Burger King to announce value bundle meals in hopes of enticing them back to their restaurants. Since President Biden took office in January 2021, grocery prices have risen by more than 21%. Overall, inflation was 3.4% higher year-over-year in April, while groceries were 2.2% more expensive than they were in 2023. Walmart executives said the chain is seeing more people eating at home versus eating out. Walmart believes its discounts will help the business over the remainder of the year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lead on price, and we\u2019re going to manage our (profit) margins, and we\u2019re going to be the Walmart that we\u2019ve always been,\u201d CEO Doug McMillon told analysts earlier this month.

Cohen, 28, was released by the Carolina Panthers earlier this month, marking the latest setback in his journey to retake the field. An All-Pro and Pro Bowl honoree back in 2018, the former multipurpose star hasn't taken an NFL snap since 2020, missing the last three seasons due to a string of serious injuries. A torn ACL, MCL and leg fracture initially cost Cohen most of the 2020 campaign, his first after landing a three-year extension with the Bears. Released by Chicago after then missing all of 2021, Cohen then suffered a torn Achilles -- the same injury that sidelined Rodgers for much of 2023 -- while working out as a free agent. He signed to Carolina's practice squad last September but didn't appear in a game.

The laughter and smiles were in short supply as the Wolves lost the first three games of the NBA Western Conference finals to Dallas, but everything was fine again Tuesday, at least for one night. The Wolves took down the Mavericks 105-100 before 20,477 at American Airlines Arena to keep their season alive and force Game 5 on Thursday at Target Center. It took Towns and Edwards re-finding themselves to finally get the first win of the series. The two outdueled Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving for the first time. Edwards had 29 points, including key buckets in the final minutes that the Wolves weren't converting in losing fourth-quarter leads during the first three games in the series. Before that, Towns caught fire after a miserable first three games. He danced around foul trouble all night to score 25 points on 9-for-13 shooting before fouling out with 98 seconds to play. He had three clutch threes in the fourth quarter to put the Wolves ahead for good. A common source of the Towns and Edwards comedy hour has been Towns' foul trouble, as it was again after Game 4. \"What I tell you about fouling?\" Edwards said. \"You had five though,\" Towns replied. \"But I didn't foul out,\" Edwards said, telling reporters, \"I'mma beat him up on the bus.\" All was good again in Wolves Land, even as there is still a long way to go for the team to advance to its first NBA Finals. When asked if this victory changed the complexion of the series, Wolves coach Chris Finch was succinct in his response. \"It doesn't,\" Finch said. \"We gotta win again.\" And again and again. But the Wolves at least leave Game 4 feeling like they played some of their best defense of the series, as they limited Irving (16 points) and Doncic (28 points) to a combined 13-for-39 shooting. The Mavericks shot 42% for the night and the Wolves were able to take advantage of the absence of big man Dereck Lively II (neck strain) to shoot 53%. The Wolves' late-game offense finally arrived in the series, specifically for Edwards, whose three-pointer from the right wing gave the Wolves a 102-97 lead with 39.7 seconds remaining and prevented Irving or Doncic from pulling off any last-second heroics. \"It took a lot of resiliency from our guys,\" said point guard Mike Conley, who was key with 14 points, seven assists and four steals, and not turning the ball over once. \"There was a lot of moments there where the game could have went the other way or we could have let go. And guys wouldn't let the refs or big plays or anything get in our way. We just kept moving forward.\" That applied to Towns, who had a game that was equal parts infuriating and effective. But Towns gave the Wolves what they needed to continue in this series. \"KAT's a great player. His struggles were not going to last forever,\" Finch said. \"He got himself going. Even when he got deep in foul trouble, we left him out there. \u2026 Just let him roll, and he played smart, played under control, rebounded really well for us, executed defensively. Really proud of him.\" Towns picked up his fifth foul with 4:59 to play in the third quarter. In that period, he committed a pair of offensive fouls \u2014 the kind of \"stray voltage\" fouls, a term Finch likes to use, that have gotten him into trouble many times before in playoff games. Towns had 15 points at that point, but he was able to play 7:29 in the fourth quarter before picking up his sixth, and the Wolves needed his shotmaking. Towns had 10 points after getting five fouls, all in the fourth quarter. His last three gave the Wolves a 98-92 lead with 2:54 to play. Before that, another Towns three put them ahead 95-90 on a play that Wolves forward Kyle Anderson seemed to singlehandedly orchestrate himself without the ball. On the play, Anderson told Towns to space to the left corner as Edwards drove to the lane from the right wing. Anderson motioned for Edwards to hit Towns as he set a screen to pop Towns open. \"I was dribbling the ball. I damn sure was about to shoot it,\" Edwards said. \"And I seen him pointing at big fella, and I'm like 'OK, cool.' Big fella, he done cashed out.\" Added Towns: \"Kyle made that play happen tonight. He made a lot of plays happen, especially his defense.\" Anderson had just two points, but he added four assists and three offensive rebounds and was able to provide defense on Doncic at times. Doncic had a triple-double with 10 assists and 15 rebounds, but he shot only 7-for-21 and had three turnovers. \"That game is on me,\" said the All-NBA first team point guard. \"I didn't bring enough energy, I have do better.\" The Wolves did just enough. \"It was special to get the dub, especially in a hostile environment,\" Anderson said. \"Showed a lot of our toughness, for sure.\" That also applied to Finch, who was up and moving around the huddle without his crutches during timeouts for the first time all series. He even drew a technical from official Scott Foster after Towns picked up his fifth foul. \"Finchy, he's our leader,\" Conley said. \"He's the guy that's made this thing work from the beginning. To have him be on the sideline, but behind the bench, for the majority of these playoffs, you forget the impact it can have when your coach is up getting technicals, yelling and we see him hobble around to do it, it's impressive.

It\u2019s at least a little surprising to see the Oilers installed as -135 favorites at home, considering the Rangers are +100 underdogs in Game 5 at home. There is plenty to be concerned about regarding the Oilers, though. Their squad looks dangerous enough on offense, but they are allowing too many soft goals, falling squarely on the back of Skinner. It sure seems like Skinner will have to play strong between the pipes if they want to have a chance to get back into this series and avoid a dreaded 3-1 deficit. Stars vs. Oilers prediction for Game 4 (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT) With their backs against the walls, the Oilers should be looking at getting Connor McDavid heavily involved throughout the evening as the most dangerous player on the ice for either team. Dallas seemed to find a groove after having just three shots on goal in the first period. They scored three goals in under four minutes to take the lead against Edmonton which they would never relinquish. Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger, the current favorite to win the Conn Smythe (+370, DraftKings), played very well after a shaky start. Betting-wise, tonight is a bit of an oxymoron. Expect McDavid to impose his will early and often, but it\u2019s impossible to trust Skinner as a favorite against the Stanley Cup favorite Stars. Same-game parlay McDavid\u2019s over shots prop with the Star\u2019s moneyline. The anti-correlation plays with the sports betting algorithm on differently depending on which sportsbook you use.

Along with Danon\u2019s post, Israeli journalist Noa Magid published the image on X (formerly known as Twitter). Israel-based news site i24 also published the photos. Haley has used the phrase \"finish them\" before, seemingly in reference to Hamas, on Instagram and in interviews. A representative for Haley did not respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment on Tuesday. Haley\u2019s Middle East visit comes amid Israel's continued offensive in Gaza. Over the weekend, Israel Defense Forces struck a tent camp in Gaza's southern city of Rafah, which was previously considered a safe zone for displaced Palestinians. The strike killed 45 people who were seeking refuge and injured 200 more, per CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a \"tragic mistake.\" Per Reuters, more than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose data has not been independently verified. Women and children comprise most of the fatalities, the Health Ministry has said. The Israel-Gaza war began on Oct. 7, after Hamas militants attacked southern Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israel. The nation responded by promising a \"complete siege\" of Gaza. Haley recently called on the U.S. government to continue providing military aid to the Israel to support its war against Hamas, per the Associated Press. Haley reentered the spotlight this month after laying low following her withdrawal from the presidential race. On May 22, while delivering remarks in Washington, D.C., Haley said she planned to vote for Donald Trump in November. Trump previously selected Haley to be the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in January 2017, a role she held until her resignation in December 2018 \u2014 but on the 2024 campaign trail, their relationship grew tense. \"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him,\" Haley said while offering a tepid endorsement. \"And I genuinely hope he does that.\"", "summary": "Haley left her mark on the IDF explosive shortly after an Israeli strike killed dozens of displaced Palestinians at a tent camp in Rafah", "url": "https://people.com/nikki-haley-signs-israeli-artillery-shell-finish-them-8654998", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/QPybtJkumSzi0YBzNTB42sToG6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(952x412:954x414)/nikki-haley-052824-22ee67ce1aae48b38030944fe4bde906.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:30:08", "author": "Charna Flam", "authors": ["Charna Flam"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.103}, {"id": 225062694, "title": "Nikki Haley wrote 'finish them' on Israel artillery shell during visit", "text": "Nikki Haley wrote \"finish them\" on an Israeli artillery shell during a recent visit to Israel.Danny Danon, a member of Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, shared a post on X on Tuesday featuring four photos of Haley and himself during her visit to Israel over Memorial Day Weekend, including one of her kneeling and writing on an artillery shell.\"Finish them!

He now faces de Jong, world-ranked 176, the 23-year-old managed to qualify in impressive style without loosing a set and battled past well-regard British youngster Jack Draper in the first-round to set up this tie. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the French Open 2024 live wherever you are in the world. Jesper De Jong vs. Carlos Alcaraz: When and where? This second round clash takes place on Court Philippe Chatrier at Stade Roland Garros in Paris on Wednesday, May 29.

If you don't have a cable or satellite TV subscription, you can watch the matches on NBC and Tennis Channel with a live-TV streaming service. For the big matches at the end of the tournament on NBC, however, you will need to make sure you can get a live feed of NBC in your area. In some markets, you can watch on-demand but not live content from NBC and the other local networks. If you live in an area with good reception, you can watch matches on NBC for free just by attaching an affordable (under $30) indoor antenna to nearly any TV. How to watch the French Open from anywhere with a VPN If you find yourself unable to view the tournament locally, you may need a different way to watch -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself.

In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location.

If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.", "summary": "This second-round clash sees the young Italian No. 2 seed take on the veteran French star.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/french-open-2024-how-to-watch-stream-gasquet-vs-sinner-from-anywhere/", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/b2f4bf3f7174c7afed0c84c52f851612b06bab3c/hub/2024/05/29/69b8e9ef-5c3a-4458-be88-e1f3c62ba71e/gettyimages-2154987448.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 17:14:01", "author": "Kevin Lynch,Matt Elliott", "authors": ["Kevin Lynch", "Matt Elliott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.288}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225141232, "title": "Orange County things to do, starting May 31", "text": "What\u2019s happening Chinese Guzheng Performance and Calligraphy Demonstration by Ann Yao and Li Wei: Ann Yao performs cutting-edge interpretations of traditional material on the Guzheng.

According to ABC News, NBC News, and CNN, on Tuesday, May 28, Wenrich, 31, was fined $9,00 and sentenced to time served following a three-week jail stay. The sentencing occurred days after Wenrich pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of ammunition for two 9 mm rounds on May 21. Wenrich received a shorter sentence than the mandatory minimum of 12 years after Justice Davidson Baptiste \"cited exceptional circumstances,\" in his case, the Turks and Caicos Islands government said in a statement, per ABC News. Baptiste added that \"enforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate and would not serve the public interest,\" ABC News and CNN reported. PEOPLE has reached out to the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands for comment. Wenrich previously said he forgot he had the ammunition in his possession while traveling to Turks and Caicos via a cruise ship for a bachelor party, per ABC News. After his sentencing, the father to an 18-month-old son told reporters outside the court that he was \"relieved.\" \"A weight has been lifted off my shoulders and my wife, and I'm glad that I get to go home and be with my son again,\" said Wenrich, per NBC News. While speaking to reporters, Wenrich described the court appearance as \"emotional.\" \"Very emotional, because it's up and down because he goes through everything. You don't know if it's going one way or the other as he's read through everything, so, so tearing up every time I heard '18-month-old son,' and now I'm just relieved at the outcome,\" he said, per NBC News. Wenrich's sentencing comes days after the release of Bryan Hagerich, a father of two who was arrested in Turks and Caicos in February after hunting ammunition was found in his checked luggage while returning home from a family vacation. Hagerich received a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine. Ryan Watson of Oklahoma, Sharitta Grier of Florida, and Michael Lee Evans of Texas have also been charged with similar ammunition charges in Turks and Caicos.

The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served, so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. Watson and Wenrich are among five Americans arrested in Turks and Caicos in recent months, all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a statement from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence suspended for one year and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.

Grand juries comprised of ordinary citizens are used by prosecutors, providing a review of documents and witnesses, and a vote on whether a case is strong enough to criminally charge a suspect. The proceedings are kept secret. Federal agents raided Combs\u2019 homes in Los Angeles and Miami on March 25 because he had \u201chundreds of cameras\u201d at the properties which may have captured some of his alleged sex crimes. Agents from U.S. Homeland Security Investigations carried out the surprise searches of the hip-hop mogul\u2019s homes in relation to an ongoing sex trafficking and racketeering investigation in New York, a law enforcement source confirmed to TheWrap at the time. Pictures from inside of the superstar\u2019s L.A. home show how the agents completely ransacked the property, taking all computer equipment and drives. \u201cThis level of force is likely because the feds likely already have the case and corroborating witnesses,\u201d the same source told TheWrap. \u201cThis is an extra search for evidence and is done with the element of surprise and force so that evidence \u2014 particularly video evidence \u2014 cannot be destroyed.\u201d Prosecutors are likely looking for evidence of \u201csex or drug trafficking, production of child pornography, or firearms,\u201d Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, who is not involved in the case, told TheWrap. \u201cAccording to the civil lawsuits, Diddy recorded sex acts and he had hidden cameras in his homes.\u201d Rahmani predicted the entertainment mogul would be charged. \u201cProsecutors in the Southern District of New York don\u2019t go to a federal judge to get search warrants at multiple properties unless they are close to a grand jury indictment,\u201d he said. The scope of the investigation is wide, focusing on sex and human trafficking, money laundering and illegal drugs, CNN reported. Combs has strongly denied all the allegations against him. \u201cMr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name,\u201d his attorney Aaron Dyer said.

Rolling Stone said reporters had interviewed more than 50 people in the showman\u2019s orbit alleged history of using violence and intimidation. The report details Diddy allegedly attacking a woman with a belt during his time at Howard University, and also assaulting another woman inside his Bad Boy Records label offices in 1994.

Reinhart \u2014 the NHL\u2019s power-play goal leader this year \u2014 came through with his 65th and most important goal of the season 1:12 into overtime, and the Panthers topped the New York Rangers 3-2 on Tuesday night, evening the Eastern Conference Final at two games apiece. \u201cIf he\u2019s open, obviously, we want to look for him,\u201d said Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov, who set Reinhart up for the game-winner. With good reason. Reinhart has 31 goals on the man advantage this year, connecting on 32% of his power-play shots. \u201cI saw him wide open there, and I was pretty confident he was putting that one in,\u201d Florida forward Carter Verhaeghe said. \u201cHe has an awesome shot and obviously he made no mistake on that one, and it was awesome.\u201d It was the third straight OT game in the series, and the first one that the Panthers scored in the extra session.

Rangers defenseman Adam Fox defended Wheeler, who basically had no chance with Barkov skating in alone on Shesterkin. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a bad penalty to take. They have a good power play and they capitalized,\u201d Fox said. Bennett got Florida on the board midway through the second period, on a second effort.

Horton said before the House in April that the commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana. \"I hope and I pray that Louisiana is the first state to allow moral code to be placed back in the classrooms,\" she said at the time. \"Since I was in kindergarten [at a private school], it was always on the wall. I learned there was a god, and I knew to honor him and his laws.\" HB 71 is expected to face legal challenges over First Amendment concerns. \"We learned the Ten commandments when we went to Sunday school,\" Democrat state Sen. Royce Duplessis previously told WWLTV. \"As I said on the Senate floor, if you want your kids to learn the Ten Commandments, you can take them to church.\" LOUISIANA BILL TO CASTRATE SEX OFFENDERS MOVING TOWARD GOVERNOR'S DESK FOR SIGNATURE CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Civil rights organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and the Southern Poverty Law Center previously issued a joint statement criticizing the legislation. \"This bill is unconstitutional,\" the statement said. \"The state may not require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Many faith-based and civil-rights organizations oppose this measure because it violates students' and families' fundamental right to religious freedom.\" \"Our public schools are not Sunday schools, and students of all faiths\u2014or no faith\u2014should feel welcome in them,\" the statement added.", "summary": "Louisiana could become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed on a poster in all schools and colleges that receive public funding.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/louisiana-become-1st-state-require-ten-commandments-displayed-schools-governor-signs-bill", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/931/523/Jeff-Landry.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 06:15:14", "author": "Landon Mion", "authors": ["Landon Mion"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.126}, {"id": 225183100, "title": "Louisiana May Require Ten Commandments in Classrooms", "text": "Taegan Goddard is the founder of Political Wire, one of the earliest and most influential political web sites.

In that 6-3 decision, the Court ruled the coach's silent prayers on the 50-yard line following games didn't violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.Proponents of the bill contend that, if it's legal to silently pray on school grounds, it's constitutional to post a multi-millennia-old document that's been foundational in the creation of our nation's laws. The proposal directly challenges Stone v. Graham, a 1980 Supreme Court decision that struck down Ten Commandment classroom displays across the country.Back then, the Justices applied the \"Lemon test,\" which required the act to have a primarily secular purpose. In Stone, the Court held that the Ten Commandments served a plainly religious purpose and, therefore, violated the Establishment Clause.Yet in the Kennedy case, today's Supreme Court clearly declared that it had \"abandoned\" the Lemon test and would instead look to \"historical practices and understandings\" to determine whether the government's actions violate the Establishment Clause. So, in the future, the Court will consider whether the Framers of the Constitution would have regarded the state actions as an establishment of religion.Now, with the Lemon test officially rejected, it's fair to ask whether, under this alternative test based on \"historical practices and understandings,\" a state could require a culturally and historically significant document, like the Ten Commandments, to be posted in public school classrooms.In 1983, when the Supreme Court heard arguments in Marsh v. Chambers, the Justices decided to ignore the Lemon test. They looked at historical practices to help decide whether a paid legislative chaplain violated the Establishment Clause. The Court held it wasn't a violation to have a government-sponsored chaplain opening legislative sessions with prayer because historical context revealed \"the men who wrote the First Amendment Religion Clauses did not view paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers as a violation of that Amendment.\"Similarly, Louisiana lawmakers have a legitimate case to make that the Framers of the U.S. Constitution would not have considered it an establishment of religion to require posting the Ten Commandments in a public classroom.Generations of Americans grew up with the Ten Commandments on their school walls. This universal set of ethical guidelines provides a moral foundation to promote the betterment of the individual and society.The Commandments also have special significance as a part of our Western cultural and legal heritage. Indeed, throughout American history, displaying them in public places has served as an acknowledgment of their influence in the development of our laws and morality.Some opponents of the Louisiana legislation argue that it violates the separation of church and state. This is a specious claim\u2014\"separation of church and state\" is never even mentioned in the U.S. Constitution.The phrase comes from a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to a Baptist church association. The association expressed concern about being targeted by the government for persecution because it was a religious minority. Jefferson used the phrase \"separation of church and state\" in an attempt to assure people of faith that the Constitution would protect their religious liberty from government discrimination.Ironically, Jefferson's words have since been used by individuals who seek to exclude religion from the public square to discriminate against people of faith.Regardless of what happens in Louisiana, the effort to return the Ten Commandments to the classroom isn't going away anytime soon.Texas and Utah tried but ultimately failed to pass their versions of the Louisiana bill this past legislative session. North Dakota and South Dakota, among other states, have already passed laws that allow the Ten Commandments to be posted in public classrooms.The time is ripe for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this topic.Given the historical practices and understandings of the Framers of the Constitution, there is ample evidence that posting the Ten Commandments is neither an endorsement nor the establishment of religion.Those who accuse legislators of doing so, or worse, falsely charging them of advocating for a theocracy, might want to consult commandment number nine: You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.Nicole Hunt is an attorney and writer for Focus on the Family's Daily Citizen.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.", "summary": "Generations of Americans grew up with the Ten Commandments on their school walls.

The lawsuit relates to reports by one of Fox\u2019s local stations. Jesse Barrett is a trial lawyer and managing partner at SouthBank Legal. He heads the firm\u2019s Washington, D.C., office, which opened after Justice Barrett joined the high court. While the SouthBank Legal website says that Jesse Barrett \u201cfocuses on white-collar criminal defense, internal investigations, and complex commercial litigation,\u201d it notes, in a recent addition, that he has \u201crepresented a prominent media company in a lawsuit alleging defamation.\u201d That prominent media company is Fox Corporation, which owns the conservative cable news channel Fox News. Fox News regularly covers matters at the Supreme Court and will surely continue to do so as the high court nears the end of its term. It is set to issue rulings soon on a slate of controversial topics, such as abortion, guns, public corruption, and whether Donald Trump is entitled to immunity for life for acts he committed as president. Jesse Barrett\u2019s work for Fox Corporation highlights one of ethics experts\u2019 biggest complaints about the Supreme Court: Justices are not required to disclose their spouses\u2019 clients, so the public has no way to track who is paying money directly to their families. In her 2021 financial disclosure, Justice Barrett even redacted the name of her husband\u2019s firm, despite it being common knowledge that he works there. The lack of disclosure surrounding spouses\u2019 business dealings has been a repeated source of ethical concerns, particularly with Justice Clarence Thomas. His wife, Ginni Thomas, has reportedly received consulting payments from conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, and ran a nonprofit that was reportedly funded by billionaire Harlan Crow. Both Leo and Crow have been at the center of the ethics controversies plaguing the Supreme Court over the past year. It is no secret that Jesse Barrett represents corporate interests: His firm bio says his \u201cclients have included multiple Fortune 500 companies and corporate executives.\u201d The Southbank Legal website says that the firm has represented 26 Fortune 500 companies. The public has no way to identify Barrett\u2019s clients, for the most part. However, federal court records show that Barrett is serving as Fox Corporation\u2019s lead counsel in an ongoing defamation case. He had the case moved from Cook County, Illinois, to federal court late last month. Barrett and Fox Corporation did not respond to requests for comment. The defamation case was filed by Lavell Redmond, an Illinois man who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault as a minor and served 24 years in prison. Redmond was hired as a code enforcement officer by the mayor of Dolton in 2021, the original complaint says. He is suing Fox over a series of reports that scandalized his hiring \u2014 the first of which claimed he had been hired for \u201ca job in which he goes into Dolton homes and businesses to inspect them.\u201d The complaint says that \u201cas a code enforcement officer, Redmond was never responsible for entering village resident\u2019s homes to do his job, nor did he ever enter village resident\u2019s homes. Redmond only had the ability to observe home exteriors to write code violations.\u201d Redmond alleges that \u201cFOX 32\u2019s reporting directly led to Redmond being arrested and wrongfully charged with violating the reporting requirements of the sex offender registry,\u201d as well as his subsequent termination. The complaint alleges Redmond has suffered more than $1 million in damages based on Fox\u2019s reporting. His summons to Fox and its affiliates show he is seeking $3 million. Barrett and Fox have asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. They argue Redmond filed his lawsuit too late, and that the Fox station did not defame him because the \u201cgist\u201d of its reporting was \u201cindisputably true, even if taking as true Redmond\u2019s allegations that certain immaterial details were inaccurate.\u201d While Southbank Legal does not publicly disclose Barrett\u2019s clients, its website indicates he has represented political and governmental clients, including: \u201ca former elected official in a federal investigation involving alleged bribery in return for political favors\u201d; \u201can executive of a military contractor in a federal investigation regarding alleged bribery in obtaining government contracts\u201d; and \u201ca senior government employee in connection with a grand jury investigation of an elected government official.\u201d", "summary": "Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s husband, Jesse Barrett, is defending Fox Corporation in a defamation case", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/amy-coney-barrett-husband-jesse-fox-1235028838/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amy-Coney-Barrett-husband-fox.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:00", "author": "Andrew Perez", "authors": ["Andrew Perez"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.116}, {"id": 225024256, "title": "Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Husband Represents Fox in Lawsuit", "text": "Taegan Goddard is the founder of Political Wire, one of the earliest and most influential political web sites.

Conille thanked the civil society groups, political parties and members of the Haitian diaspora who proposed him as a candidate, saying he was \"very honored\" to have been chosen. HAITI COUNCIL APPOINTS NEW PRIME MINISTER AS COUNTRY CONTINUES TO FACE DEADLY GANG VIOLENCE \"Together, we will work for a better tomorrow for all the children of our nation,\" he wrote on X, the social media platform, in Haitian Creole. Conille submitted his resignation Tuesday as UNICEF\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, a post he has held since January 2023. He previously served as prime minister of Haiti from October 2011 to May 2012 under then-President Michel Martelly and was former chief of staff to Bill Clinton in the ex-president\u2019s role as U.N. special envoy to Haiti. Conille studied medicine and public health and helped develop health care in impoverished communities in Haiti, where he helped coordinate reconstruction efforts after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He also served as a U.N. development specialist before becoming a regional director with UNICEF. He now faces a monumental task, with Haiti under siege by gangs that control at least 80% of the Port-au-Prince capital as the country awaits the U.N.-backed deployment of a police force from Kenya and other countries supporting the mission. The prime minister shares executive power with the presidency, which has been vacant in Haiti since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse. whose death left a power vacuum that criminal gangs began to take advantage of later that year. In addition to choosing the prime minister, the transitional council is tasked with arranging presidential elections before early 2026. Council members told The Associated Press late Tuesday that six of seven members with voting powers had selected Conille for the prime minister role. Laurent St. Cyr, the seventh member, is not in Haiti currently and as a result did not vote. On Wednesday, they issued a statement noting that Conille was one of five prequalified candidates that they interviewed for one hour each on Tuesday, and that they are now working with him to choose a new Cabinet. \"The transitional presidential council renews its firm determination to do everything possible to stem the phenomenon of insecurity and lead the country on the path to free, fair, democratic and inclusive elections,\" it said. Conille will replace interim Prime Minister Michel Patrick Boisvert, who has been helping lead the country since former Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned via letter in April following a surge in gang violence. Gunmen launched coordinated attacks on Feb. 29, seizing control of police stations, opening fire on the main international airport that remained closed for nearly three months and storming Haiti's two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. The wave of violence continues. Boivert issued a statement Wednesday congratulating Conille, adding that he \"hopes the new prime minister will be able to face the challenges and issues of the moment.\" Also congratulating Conille was Kenyan President William Ruto, who wrote on X Wednesday that \"this significant step is not lost on the world.\" He added that Kenya was looking forward to working with Conille and his government \"to restore Haiti to a path of sustainable development.\" It was not immediately clear if there would be a formal swearing-in ceremony for Conille. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement that she wished Conille \"every success in bringing much-needed peace, stability and hope to the children of Haiti.\" Conille was not the first choice for some council members. In late April, a four-member coalition within the council made an unexpected announcement that they had chosen former sports minister Fritz B\u00e9lizaire as prime minister. The move threatened to fracture the council, with dissenting members insisting that proper procedure be followed.

Much of what judges do unfolds out of sight in the sanctity of their chambers. But at seven public hearings over more than 10 months, Cannon has left an increasingly detailed record of her decision-making skills and judicial temperament. The portrait that has emerged is that of an industrious but inexperienced and often insecure judge whose reluctance to rule decisively even on minor matters has permitted one of the country\u2019s most important criminal cases to become bogged down in a logjam of unresolved issues. She rarely issues rulings that explain her thinking in a way that might reveal her legal influences or any guiding philosophy. And that has made the hearings, which have taken place in U.S. District Court in Fort Pierce, Florida, all the more important in assessing her management of the case. Regardless of her motives, Cannon has effectively imperiled the future of a criminal prosecution that once seemed the most straightforward of the four Trump is facing. She has largely accomplished this by granting a serious hearing to almost every issue \u2014 no matter how far-fetched \u2014 that Trump\u2019s lawyers have raised, playing directly into the former president\u2019s strategy of delaying the case from reaching trial. It appears increasingly likely that the documents case will not go to a jury before Election Day, and that the only trial that Trump will face this year will be the one now ending in Manhattan, where jurors are expected to begin deliberating Wednesday over whether he falsified business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor. Still, the next few weeks will bring Cannon\u2019s handling of the case in Florida into even sharper focus. She may soon rule on a request by Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing the two federal prosecutions of the former president, to ban Trump from making public statements that could endanger federal agents working on the documents case. That move, which the judge denied this week on procedural grounds, came in response to the former president\u2019s baseless assertion that the FBI was authorized to use deadly force against him during the search two years ago of Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida. After a hearing in June, Cannon will also have to make a significant decision on whether to give Trump\u2019s lawyers access to communications between Smith\u2019s team and top national security officials. The lawyers made that request hoping to bolster their contention that the so-called deep state colluded with the Biden administration to bring the charges. A former federal prosecutor, Cannon graduated from Duke University and the University of Michigan\u2019s law school, where she joined the conservative Federalist Society. She was nominated to the federal bench by Trump during his final months in office and was confirmed by the Senate just days after he was declared the loser of the 2020 election. She was already under scrutiny when she got the classified documents case last June because of a decision she made well before the indictment was filed. That ruling, which shut down the investigation into Trump until an independent arbiter sorted through reams of materials seized from Mar-a-Lago, was so legally dubious that the appeals court sitting over her reversed it in unusually scathing terms. Since then, Cannon has shown little of her human side in court, taking a businesslike approach to the proceedings, which always begin the same way. Invariably entering her courtroom on time, she first admonishes those in the gallery not to use electronic devices and reminds them of her rule forbidding getting up while a hearing is in progress. She then lays out the issues at hand and recounts the documents she has received that will inform the conversation. Even though she has been on the bench for only four years and has limited experience handling criminal cases, it is often clear that Cannon has done her homework. In mid-March, for instance, she was discussing the key elements of the Espionage Act with Emil Bove, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers and an expert on classified information cases. At one point, she pushed back at Bove\u2019s contention that a section of the act requiring \u201cnational defense information\u201d to be present in any documents charged in an indictment was so vaguely written that it was essentially unenforceable. \u201cThere has been a fair amount of litigation, I think, on the defense information prong,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cSo it would be hard to say, based on the current state of decisional authority, that that prong, in and of itself, is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d Even though it meant that he had lost the point, Bove had to agree. \u201cI can\u2019t fight with the way that Your Honor phrased that,\u201d he said. That exchange, however, was a far cry from one that occurred last week when Cannon was debating with Jay Bratt, one of the prosecutors, about a common theory of legal liability called the Pinkerton rule. The rule holds that all members of a conspiracy can be held accountable for any crimes committed by their co-conspirators. Bratt said the rule would likely apply to Trump\u2019s dealings with his two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, employees of Mar-a-Lago who have been accused of conspiring with the former president to obstruct the government\u2019s repeated efforts to retrieve the classified materials. Cannon seemed a bit perplexed and asked Bratt what authority he intended to rely on in applying the Pinkerton rule. Bratt seemed almost sheepish in having to lay things out for her so simply. \u201cSo the authority is Pinkerton,\u201d he said, and launched into a quick explanation. One of Cannon\u2019s most enduring habits is her tendency to ask the same question several times. It is never quite clear if she does not understand the answers she is receiving or is trying to push back against them. At last week\u2019s hearing, she did this to Stanley Woodward Jr., Nauta\u2019s lawyer, as she considered his request to order prosecutors to provide him with internal communications that could help support his claims that the case against his client had been brought vindictively. The communications Woodward was looking for concerned a meeting he attended at the Justice Department nearly two years ago where, he claims, Bratt threatened to derail a judgeship he had applied for if he did not prevail on Nauta to cooperate against Trump. When Cannon asked Woodward what he actually wanted from the government, his answer seemed simple enough: any messages exchanged by prosecutors that mentioned his name. The judge then asked a second time, telling Woodward to give it to her \u201cslowly.\u201d But even after that, it seemed that she was still a bit confused. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, this time referring to notes she had taken. \u201cSo I understand your request. It\u2019s, quote, \u2018All documents, communications concerning Mr. Woodward.\u2019 \u201d Something similar happened moments later when Cannon turned to David Harbach, one of the prosecutors, to discuss Woodward\u2019s request. Harbach had just spent the better part of five minutes telling the judge that Woodward\u2019s claims of misconduct were a \u201cfantasy\u201d and that, under the law, he was not entitled to rummage around in the government\u2019s private messages. But Cannon seemed to miss his point, asking Harbach if he was suggesting that prosecutors did not have any of the messages that Woodward wanted. No, he told her, explaining again that Woodward had failed to present any evidence that would even merit turning over what he wanted. \u201cSo I guess what you are saying is you\u2019re not sure?\u201d she asked. No, Harbach said for a third time, once more trying to explain that Woodward\u2019s description of the meeting in August 2022 was entirely false and that the normal legal threshold for handing over private communications had simply not been reached. \u201cI know you disagree with the factual recitation of the August meeting,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cBut would that provide a basis for the discovery request?\u201d Now clearly frustrated, Harbach said as plainly as he could that Woodward\u2019s request had no basis in either fact or law. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m trying to tell you,\u201d he all but shouted at the judge. That discussion ultimately ended with Cannon telling Harbach he needed to \u201ccalm down.\u201d It was emblematic of the dwindling reserves of patience between Canon and the prosecutors. In October, for example, Cannon lashed out at Harbach at a different hearing about whether Woodward had a conflict of interest in the case. The question revolved around the fact that Woodward was representing Nauta, one of the defendants, and had formerly represented a man likely to testify for the government at trial. When Harbach expressed concern that Woodward might have to cross-examine a former client \u2014 a situation that could easily lead to a conflict \u2014 Cannon chided him for having failed to mention that possibility in his written filings submitted before the hearing. Citing Harbach\u2019s \u201clast-minute introduction of an issue that was not briefed,\u201d she abruptly ended the hearing and assailed the prosecution for \u201cwasting the court\u2019s time.\u201d But she acted very differently at the hearing last week when Woodward made several arguments about his claims of vindictive prosecution that had never appeared in any of his filings. Cannon hardly seemed to notice that he had wandered from his script, let alone rebuke him. There is one subject the defense loves to talk about that always seems to set Cannon on edge: Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. While she has allowed his lawyers leeway in using their briefings to make political arguments, she has repeatedly shut them down when they have tried to raise the subject of politics in court. In early March, Bove began an argument on a highly technical legal issue by complaining that Trump should not have been in court at all that day, but instead should have been out campaigning. Apparently annoyed, Cannon cut him off. \u201cOK, OK,\u201d she said. \u201cCan we talk about the actual legal issues?\u201d This article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "summary": "Emerging Portrait of Judge in Trump Documents Case: Prepared, Prickly and Slow", "url": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/05/29/emerging-portrait-of-judge-in-trump-documents-case-prepared-prickly-and-slow/", "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unnamed-file-2036.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:08:10", "author": "Alan Feuer", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.167}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225107556, "title": "3 Black men sue American Airlines for discrimination after being kicked from flight - UPI.com", "text": "May 29 (UPI) -- Three Black men sued American Airlines on Wednesday charging discrimination when they and five other Black men were kicked off a flight in January over a complaint of \"offensive body odor.\" Emmanuel Jean Joseph, Alvin Jackson and Xavier Jones -- who were flying separately and did not know each other -- said in their complaint filed in New York federal court they were removed from a connecting flight from Phoenix to New York when the incident happened.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, the three plaintiffs \u2014 Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph and Xavier Veal \u2014 say that they and five other Black male passengers were removed from an American Airlines flight from Phoenix to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport in January \u201cwithout any valid reason, based solely on their race.\u201d The eight men did not know each other and were not seated together on the flight. According to the lawsuit, an American Airlines representative approached each of the eight men and told them to leave the plane and return to the gate in order to be rebooked. \u201cIn fact, once they reached the jet bridge, they saw that several other Black men were also being removed from the plane. In fact, it appeared to Plaintiffs that American had ordered all of the Black male passengers on Flight 832 off the plane,\u201d the lawsuit says. Once all eight men were off the plane, they eventually discovered the reason behind their removal \u2014 an employee told the men someone on the plane complained about body odor. Jackson, Joseph and Veal say they were not told they had body odor, according to the lawsuit. When the three men pointed out that they were being treated unfairly due to their race, an American Airlines staff member said she \u201cdid not disagree,\u201d the lawsuit says. All eight men were eventually allowed back on the plane nearly an hour after the airline determined there were no available flights going to JFK airport that evening. \u201cPlaintiffs then had to reboard the plane and endure the stares of the largely white passengers who viewed them as the cause of the substantial delay. They suffered during the entire flight home, and the entire incident was traumatic, upsetting, scary, humiliating, and degrading,\u201d the lawsuit reads. In a statement to NPR, American Airlines said it takes all claims of discrimination \"very seriously\" and wants customers to have a \"positive experience\" when they fly with it. \"Our teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people,\" the airline said. Jackson, Joseph, and Veal say what happened to them was \"wrong,\" and they say their experience flying with the airline left them embarrassed and humiliated. \u201cImagine a flight attendant ordering every white person off a plane because of a complaint about one white person. That would never happen. But that is what happened to us,\" the three men said. \"There is no explanation other than the color of our skin ... clearly, this was discrimination.\" The lawsuit is the latest in a string of recent incidents in which the airline has faced allegations of racial discrimination. In February, a Chicago woman says she was discriminated against after a flight attendant allegedly confronted her after she used the plane\u2019s first-class restroom. Pamela Hill-Veal, who is Black, says that while she and her family were flying first class on Feb. 10 from Chicago to Phoenix, one of the American Airlines flight attendants stopped her as she returned to her seat \u2014 and accused her of slamming the restroom door. \"The flight attendant stopped me as I was returning to my seat and told me I 'slammed the restroom door and I was not to do it again since passengers were sleeping on the plane,'\" Hill-Veal said in an interview with NPR. She said she never slammed the door. In a statement to NPR, American Airlines said it had been in contact with Hill-Veal to learn more about her experience. \"We strive to ensure that every customer has a positive travel experience, and we take all claims of discrimination very seriously,\" the airline said. When asked whether it was considering changes in training or policy for its staff, the airline did not respond. In 2023, the company drew criticism after two separate incidents \u2014 one involving track star Sha'Carri Richardson and another involving musician David Ryan Harris \u2014 made headlines. Richardson was forced off her American flight following an argument with a flight attendant. Richardson said the flight attendant was harassing her and trying to intimidate her, Axios reported. In a statement to Axios, the airline said it investigates all claims of discrimination, adding, \"American Airlines strives to provide a positive and welcoming experience to everyone who travels with us, and we take allegations of discrimination very seriously.\" And, in September of that year, Harris, who was traveling with his two biracial children, says he was stopped and questioned at Los Angeles International Airport after an American Airlines flight attendant suspected he was trafficking the children.

The U.S. Championships, held in Fort Worth, Texas this weekend, determine the gymnasts competing at Olympic Trials later this month. Douglas was slated to compete on three of the four events at the Championships after failing to qualify as an all-around competitor. Her last competitive outing was the Core Hydration Classic in Hartford, Connecticut earlier this month, where she withdrew after struggling on the uneven bars. Douglas, 28, pulled out of the competition in the first rotation. She hit a clean set in warmups, but fell twice on the uneven bars in competition for a 10.100. Douglas returned to competition for the first time since the 2016 Rio Olympics at the American Classic in Katy, Texas in April.

She first announced her intention to return to the Olympics on \u201cHallie Jackson NOW\u201d earlier this year.

At the 2016 Olympics, Douglas helped the U.S. women to their second consecutive win in the team event, garnering her a third Olympic gold medal. She did not make a run for the most recent Olympics in Tokyo, a move many in the gymnastics world interpreted as a de facto retirement announcement.

The efforts in California \u2014 home to many of the world\u2019s biggest AI companies \u2014 could pave the way for AI regulations across the country. The United States is already behind Europe in regulating AI to limit risks, lawmakers and experts say, and the rapidly growing technology is raising concerns about job loss, misinformation, invasions of privacy and automation bias. A slew of proposals aimed at addressing those concerns advanced last week, but must win the other chamber's approval before arriving at Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. The Democratic governor has promoted California as an early adopter as well as regulator, saying the state could soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion, make roads safer and provide tax guidance, even as his administration considers new rules against AI discrimination in hiring practices. As the legislative debates went on this week, OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, said it formed a safety and security committee to evaluate the company\u2019s processes and safeguards. The move came as concerns mount over the use of rapidly developing artificial intelligence technology. With strong privacy laws already in place, California is in a better position to enact impactful regulations than other states with large AI interests, such as New York, said Tatiana Rice, deputy director of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit that works with lawmakers on technology and privacy proposals. \u201cYou need a data privacy law to be able to pass an AI law,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe\u2019re still kind of paying attention to what New York is doing, but I would put more bets on California.\u201d California lawmakers said they cannot wait to act, citing hard lessons they learned from failing to rein in social media companies when they might have had a chance. But they also want to continue attracting AI companies to the state. Here's a closer look at California's proposals: FIGHTING AI DISCRIMINATION AND BUILDING PUBLIC TRUST Some companies, including hospitals, already use AI models to define decisions about hiring, housing and medical options for millions of Americans without much oversight. Up to 83% of employers are using AI to help in hiring, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. How those algorithms work largely remains a mystery. One of the most ambitious AI measures in California this year would pull back the curtains on these models by establishing an oversight framework to prevent bias and discrimination. It would require companies using AI tools to participate in decisions that determine results and to inform people affected when AI is used. AI developers would have to routinely make internal assessments of their models for bias. And the state attorney general would have authority to investigate reports of discriminating models and impose fines of $10,000 per violation. AI companies also might soon be required to start disclosing what data they're using to train their models. PROTECTING JOBS AND LIKENESS Inspired by the months-long Hollywood actors strike last year, a California lawmaker wants to protect workers from being replaced by their AI-generated clones \u2014 a major point of contention in contract negotiations. The proposal, backed by the California Labor Federation, would let performers back out of existing contracts if vague language might allow studios to freely use AI to digitally clone their voices and likeness. It would also require that performers be represented by an attorney or union representative when signing new \u201cvoice and likeness\u201d contracts. California may also create penalties for digitally cloning dead people without the consent of their estate, citing the case of a media company that produced a fake, AI-generated hourlong comedy special to recreate the late comedian George Carlin's style and material without his estate's permission. REGULATING POWERFUL GENERATIVE AI SYSTEMS Real-world risks abound as generative AI creates new content such as text, audio and photos in response to prompts. So lawmakers are considering requiring guardrails around \u201cextremely large\u201d AI systems that have the potential to spit out instructions for creating disasters \u2014 such as building chemical weapons or assisting in cyberattacks \u2014 that could cause at least $500 million in damages. It would require such models to have a built-in \u201ckill switch,\u201d among other things. The measure, supported by some of the most renowned AI researchers, would also create a new state agency to oversee developers and provide best practices, including for still-more powerful models that don't yet exist. The state attorney general also would be able to pursue legal actions in case of violations. BANNING DEEPFAKES INVOLVING POLITICS OR PORNOGRAPHY A bipartisan coalition seeks to facilitate prosecuting people who use AI tools to create images of child sexual abuse. Current law does not allow district attorneys to go after people who possess or distribute AI-generated child sexual abuse images if the materials are not depicting a real person, law enforcement said. A host of Democratic lawmakers are also backing a bill tackling election deepfakes, citing concerns after AI-generated robocalls mimicked President Biden\u2019s voice ahead of New Hampshire\u2019s recent presidential primary. The proposal would ban \u201cmaterially deceptive\u201d deepfakes related to elections in political mailers, robocalls and TV ads 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. Another proposal would require social media platforms to label any election-related posts created by AI.

Security Council resolution that would demand an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and order Israel to halt its military offensive in the southern city of Rafah immediately. The draft resolution, obtained Tuesday evening by The Associated Press, also demands that the cease-fire be respected by all parties. It also calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken during Hamas\u2019 attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Some diplomats said they hoped for a quick vote, even as early as Wednesday. \u201cIt is our hope that it can be done as quickly as possible because life is in the balance,\u201d Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong told reporters. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see it and then we\u2019ll react to it.\u201d The United States has vetoed multiple resolutions demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. The draft demands compliance with previous Security Council resolutions that call for the opening of all border crossings and humanitarian access to Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people who desperately need food and other aid. The proposed resolution says that \u201cthe catastrophic situation in the Gaza Strip constitutes a threat to regional and international peace and security.\u201d It expresses grave concern at \u201cfamine spreading throughout the Gaza Strip\u201d and the suffering of Palestinians who took refuge in Rafah. The resolution would demand that Israel \u201cimmediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in Rafah.\u201d The draft condemns what it calls \u201cthe indiscriminate targeting of civilians, including women and children, and civilian infrastructure\u201d and reiterates the council\u2019s demand for all parties to comply with international law requiring the protection of civilians.

After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since the World Cup, Green has been profitable in multiple areas on his soccer picks, including the Champions League (+4.78 units), the FA Cup (+3.07), the EFL Cup (+3.64), Euro 2024 qualifiers (+3.01) and the Europa League (+1.60). For Olympiacos vs. Fiorentina, Green is picking Fiorentina to lift the trophy for a -130 payout. The expert notes that both sides have been involved in high-scoring games in this competition. However, La Viola have been the more consistent of the two clubs. It should be noted that Fiorentina have had road struggles across all competition this season, and that Olympiacos will get a boost from play in front of their home crowd. Nonetheless, Green thinks Fiorentina will have enough firepower to outduel the Greek hosts. \"This could prove to be another open and entertaining clash,\" Green told SportsLine. \"It could also be tight, as both teams are on a roll, and they will both be desperate for silverware, but Fiorentina's superior attacking quality could ultimately make the difference.\" Stream the game here and check out full soccer coverage on CBS Sports Golazo Network.

How to watch Olympiakos vs. Fiorentina online from anywhere using a VPN If you find yourself unable to view the Europa Conference League final locally, you may need a different way to watch the action -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions. Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.

Quick tips for streaming UEFA Europa Conference League final using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming Europa Conference League final may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services.

The district is also home to Uvalde, Texas, where two years ago, 19 children and two adults were murdered in an elementary school shooting.

TONY GONZALES OVER VOTES ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, GUNS AND BORDER SECURITY Herrera was backed by controversial Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Rep. Bob Good of Florida, another far-right House member and the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Gonzales won over 45% of the vote in the March primary, with Herrera a distant second at 25%. However, since neither grabbed a majority of the vote, under Texas law, they both advanced to a one-on-one runoff. Veteran Texas-based Republican strategist Brendan Steinhauser noted that Herrera branded the showdown as \"an establishment versus far-right, populist race,\" and that Gonzales was well aware \"that he needs to protect his right flank\" However, he added that \"Tony has a pretty big presence in the conservative eco ecosystem. He\u2019s on Fox News a lot, talking about the border.\" Outside groups shelled out over $5 million in ad spending in the race, according to AdImpact, a leading ad tracking firm. Among the groups helping Gonzales were the Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund, the Hispanic Leadership Alliance, and the American Action Network, which is aligned with the House GOP leadership.

The capture of the area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, gives Israel control over a strip of land it says is awash in smuggling tunnels that have funneled weapons and other goods for Hamas \u2014 even under a yearslong blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. The move comes as Israel has deepened its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people seeking shelter from fighting elsewhere had been displaced, and where intensifying violence in recent days has killed dozens of Palestinians. The capture of the corridor could complicate Israel's relations with Egypt, which has previously complained over Israel's advance toward its border, including when Israel took over the Rafah border crossing, the only crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Egypt has said that any increase in troops in the strategic corridor would violate the countries' 1979 peace accord. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said Israel had notified Egypt of the takeover. He said some 20 tunnels, including some that were previously unknown to Israel, had been found during the operation, as well as 82 access points to those tunnels. \u201cIt means we can control and we have the ability to cut off the oxygen line that Hamas has used for replenishing and movement,\u201d the official said. The corridor is part of a larger demilitarized zone along both sides of the entire Israel-Egypt border. Under the peace accord, each is allowed to deploy only a tiny number of troops or border guards in the zone, though those numbers can be modified by mutual agreement. At the time of the accord, Israeli troops controlled Gaza, until Israel withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005. Egypt's state-run Al-Qahera News TV reported that there are \u201cno communications with the Israeli side\u201d on the allegations of finding tunnels on the borders. Egypt has repeatedly expressed concerns that the Israeli offensive could push Palestinian across the border \u2014 a scenario Egypt says is unacceptable. The narrow corridor \u2014 about 100 meters (yards) wide in parts \u2014 runs the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) length of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt and includes the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Hamas has had free rein of the border since its 2007 takeover of Gaza. Smuggling tunnels were dug under the Gaza-Egypt border to get around the Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed after Hamas took over with the aim of preventing it from building up its military stockpile. Some of the tunnels were massive, large enough for vehicles. Hamas brought in weapons and supplies, and Gaza residents smuggled in commercial goods, from livestock to construction materials. That changed over the past decade, as Egypt battled Islamic militants in Sinai. The Egyptian military cracked down on the tunnels and destroyed hundreds of them, saying they were being used to transfer weapons into the Sinai Peninsula.

The United States, Israel's top ally, has already demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decide on a postwar vision for the Palestinian territory. Netanyahu's defense minister and a top governing partner have warned that he must take steps to ensure that Israel isn\u2019t bogged down in Gaza indefinitely. The war has already devastated Gaza\u2019s urban landscape, displaced most of its population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe and widespread hunger. It has opened Israel up to international legal scrutiny, with world courts faulting it over its wartime conduct, sparked disagreements with the White House, and prompted three European nations to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, against Israel\u2019s wishes. Israel says it must dismantle Hamas' last remaining battalions in Rafah and has said it will seek indefinite security control over the Gaza Strip, even after the war ends. Still, it has yet to achieve its main goals of dismantling Hamas and returning scores of hostages captured in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Beyond Rafah, Israeli forces were still battling militants in parts of Gaza that the military said it wrested control of months ago \u2014 potential signs of a low-level insurgency that could keep Israeli troops engaged in the territory. The fighting in Rafah has displaced 1 million people, the United Nations says, most of whom were already displaced from other parts of Gaza. Palestinians on Wednesday reported heavy fighting in different parts of the city. Residents said fighting was underway in the city center and on the outskirts of Tel al-Sultan, the same neighborhood where an Israeli strike over the weekend ignited a fire that swept through an encampment for displaced people, killing dozens. The military says it's investigating the strike and that the blaze may have been caused by a secondary explosion. An expensive floating pier built by the U.S. to surge aid into the territory was meanwhile damaged in bad weather, another setback to efforts to bring food to starving Palestinians. Gaza's land crossings are now entirely controlled by Israel. The U.S. and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in Rafah, with the Biden administration saying this would cross a \u201cred line\u201d and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. But so far, it hasn't tried to stop Israel's advances through the city. Last week, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive as part of South Africa\u2019s case accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza, a charge Israel vehemently denies. The war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel\u2019s offensive in response to the attack has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Israel says it has killed 15,000 militants. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/senior-israeli-official-offers-grim-144716449.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EgJrsdCNVctKyrrbSkdixA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/4a98c85882abc5e0b1419864313b27a7", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 18:39:01", "author": "Tia Goldenberg, Wafaa Shurafa And Samy Magdy", "authors": ["Tia Goldenberg, Wafaa Shurafa And Samy Magdy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.069}, {"id": 225159150, "title": "Israel&#8217;s military says it&#8217;s taken control of a strategic corridor along Gaza&#8217;s border with Egypt", "text": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel\u2019s military said Wednesday it had seized control of a strategic corridor that runs along the length of Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt, an objective Israel had said was necessary in its bid to destroy Hamas as part of the ongoing war, now in its eighth month. The capture of the area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, gives Israel control over a strip of land it says is awash in smuggling tunnels that have funneled weapons and other goods for Hamas \u2014 even under a yearslong blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. The move comes as Israel has deepened its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people seeking shelter from fighting elsewhere had been displaced, and where intensifying violence in recent days has killed dozens of Palestinians. The capture of the corridor could complicate Israel\u2019s relations with Egypt, which has previously complained over Israel\u2019s advance toward its border, including when Israel took over the Rafah border crossing, the only crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Egypt has said that any increase in troops in the strategic corridor would violate the countries\u2019 1979 peace accord. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said Israel had notified Egypt of the takeover. He said some 20 tunnels, including some that were previously unknown to Israel, had been found during the operation, as well as 82 access points to those tunnels. \u201cIt means we can control and we have the ability to cut off the oxygen line that Hamas has used for replenishing and movement,\u201d the official said. The corridor is part of a larger demilitarized zone along both sides of the entire Israel-Egypt border. Under the peace accord, each is allowed to deploy only a tiny number of troops or border guards in the zone, though those numbers can be modified by mutual agreement. At the time of the accord, Israeli troops controlled Gaza, until Israel withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005. Egypt\u2019s state-run Al-Qahera News TV reported that there are \u201cno communications with the Israeli side\u201d on the allegations of finding tunnels on the borders. Egypt has repeatedly expressed concerns that the Israeli offensive could push Palestinian across the border \u2014 a scenario Egypt says is unacceptable. The narrow corridor \u2014 about 100 meters (yards) wide in parts \u2014 runs the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) length of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt and includes the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Hamas has had free rein of the border since its 2007 takeover of Gaza. Smuggling tunnels were dug under the Gaza-Egypt border to get around the Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed after Hamas took over with the aim of preventing it from building up its military stockpile. Some of the tunnels were massive, large enough for vehicles. Hamas brought in weapons and supplies, and Gaza residents smuggled in commercial goods, from livestock to construction materials. That changed over the past decade, as Egypt battled Islamic militants in Sinai. The Egyptian military cracked down on the tunnels and destroyed hundreds of them, saying they were being used to transfer weapons into the Sinai Peninsula. The Israeli military official said Israel has also taken \u201ctactical control\u201d of Tel al-Sultan, a neighborhood on Rafah\u2019s northwest edge.

Who knew becoming a dancing star on social media was so dangerous? DANCING FOR THE DEVIL: THE 7M TIKTOK CULT: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT? Opening Shot: A house near Detroit. We see a video of Miranda and Melanie Wilking talking about childhood journals on their YouTube channel. The Gist: Most of Dancing For The Devil centers around the Wilking sisters, who became very popular on both YouTube and TikTok; on the latter, they became well-known for the dance routines they posted there. After they got a DM from James Derrick, known on Instagram as @bdash_2, they collaborated with him. Soon, Miranda and Derrick got into a relationship, and she moved to Los Angeles. The deeper their relationship got, the more Miranda got involved in the Shekinah Church, run by Shinn. About a dozen other dancers, all of whom were religiously-inclined, were members of the church, and Shinn decided to create 7M Films in order to help them all with the production of social media videos and assist in sorting out all of the opportunities that came their way as their feeds became popular. This is when Miranda began pulling away from her family, with whom she used to be close. Even Melanie stopped hearing from her sister, finding out that she and Derrick got engaged via a dance video on her feed. Doneen interviews Melanie Wilking and her parents, Dean and Kelly, and also talks to former members of the church who talk about the concept of \u201cDie to yourself\u201d, a principle that Shinn taught that may have been the reason why Miranda Wilking and others decided to cut off communication with family members. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? There have been so many cult-based docuseries lately, but Dancing For The Devil feels somewhat closer in spirit to The Secrets Of Hillsong. Our Take: Most cult-oriented docuseries talk to and about the people who got sucked into the cult, and lean especially hard on the one or two families who are the most vocal about losing contact with loved ones who are inside that cult. But they also devote a good amount of time to how the leaders of these cults manage to bring in people via promises of changing their lives and are charming and persuasive enough to get them to stay, despite increasingly strange and restrictive conditions. Dancing For The Devil has a lot of the former and almost none of the latter. The Wilking sisters are the main focus of the first episode, and they are the most dominant example of a family fighting tooth and nail to bring a loved one they feel they lost to 7M back into the fold. There\u2019s a scene, for instance, of Dean Wikling videoing an attempt to contact Miranda through the gate intercom at the mansion where many of 7M\u2019s dancers lived and created content. There\u2019s also a detailed account of how Miranda refused to attend her grandfather\u2019s funeral. It\u2019s all heart-tugging stuff; you can\u2019t help but feel for the Wilkings given just how close the sisters were. But there isn\u2019t a whole lot of information about Shinn and just what he was able to do to keep Miranda and other people locked into the organization, much less persuade them to separate themselves from their families. There are some audio recordings of Shinn giving sermons and discussing what outsiders are saying about the church. But no particular evidence is presented that would tell us just why people became so loyal to him. Was it the fact that the members of 7M were all religious and they identified with his message? Or was it the fact that he promised increased exposure to their social media feeds through their production and marketing, with the increased money that comes with it? It\u2019s unclear. And there\u2019s no real evidence that Shinn had the charm to make people follow him, or was able to create a system of followers who could do the persuading for him. There are fleeting moments where we see evidence of just what members of 7M think of their families, notably a post by Derrick that calls the Wilkings racists who didn\u2019t accept him into their family because he was Black. But we never get more than a glimpse; in fact the Wilkings don\u2019t even talk about the incendiary post and why Derrick may have said what he said. It\u2019s obvious that the former members who are interviewed feel he did brainwash them, and in the second episode, the inevitable increase in abuse will be discussed. But the first part of the series didn\u2019t really give us much a feel of the whys and hows of 7M, which is always what we\u2019re looking for in shows like this. Sex and Skin: None. Parting Shot: Melanie Lee, a former member of the church, talks about seeing the videos Melanie and her parents made talking about Shinn, and she says, \u201cNo fucking way\u2026 he\u2019s still around.\u201d Sleeper Star: Kevin \u201cKonkrete\u201d Davis is one of the more persuasive former 7M members that are interviewed, especially when he talks about Shinn trying to persuade him to \u201cdie to\u201d his young son, something by which Davis couldn\u2019t abide. Most Pilot-y Line: There\u2019s a segment where the former 7M members talk about how Shinn got them to dance to classic songs instead of the latest dance hits. Yes, it worked, which may be evidence of why people became loyal to Shinn. But that connection isn\u2019t very strong and it makes us wonder why that information is there. Our Call: SKIP IT. Dancing For The Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult isn\u2019t necessarily one-sided, but it\u2019s certainly unbalanced, in the sense that we hear a lot about the victims of 7M were told to do but not a lot about what drew them to Shinn and made them stay under his control.

The series is not an academic exploration; it\u2019s reporting on families trying to save their children and escaped followers\u2019 efforts to rebuild their lives. In the second episode, though, Doneen does travel back in time\u2014because, unsurprisingly, 7M is not Shinn\u2019s first controversial endeavor. The documentary covers how Shinn founded Shekinah Church\u2014which is not affiliated with other organizations by the same name\u2014in 1994, after leaving a medical career in Canada and immigrating to the United States. Viewers learn about the church\u2019s early years from a different Melanie, a Korean American immigrant who attended services as a teenager. When she and her sister Priscylla joined Shekinah more than 20 years ago, there were only about 15 congregants, mostly comprised of Shinn\u2019s family. The church convinced the girls to live in its housing, moved them around every six to eight months, and eventually separated them. It allegedly prevented them from visiting one another and controlled what and when they ate. After Shinn told Melanie she would have to \u201cpay\u201d her \u201cprice\u201d by becoming his mistress, she says, she orchestrated an escape. That was more than a decade ago. (Shinn did not respond to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment. As stated at the end of the docuseries, Shinn has denied the allegations against him, including those of sexual abuse, no criminal charges have been brought against him, and the civil lawsuit\u2014the claims of which he and his codefendants have denied\u2014is ongoing.) When Doneen began shooting, Priscylla was still a member of the church. But during production, she escaped\u2014and, after much trust-building, joined the project. With incredible strength and composure, she details her slow descent into powerlessness and alleged continual rape at Shinn\u2019s whim. Thanks to her participation, viewers witness some of the true costs of membership in a cult-like group. \u201cWhen you get out of a situation like that, you\u2019re not free,\u201d explains Acevedo, the series\u2019 co-executive producer. One exchange in particular about a child\u2019s birthday party lays bare the impossibility of reentering society and maintaining healthy relationships after being drawn into an organization like Shekinah\u2014a raw and heartrending scene even for those who are deeply familiar with media about cults. Although women continue to come forward with stories of alleged physical abuse, much about Shinn, 7M, and Shekinah remains anonymous or off the record. More known at this time are details of Shinn\u2019s alleged financial exploitations. Over the years, his businesses have included a cafe, two mortgage companies, two flower shops, and two real estate companies, all of which were run by church members. According to Priscylla, the mortgage and real estate companies brought in more than 1 million dollars in commissions in 2021. As a broker, she was responsible for much of that business\u2014but, she claims in the series, she wasn\u2019t allowed to touch her bank account, and was instead given an allowance of $80 every two weeks. In a 2013 lawsuit, former church member Jung Hee Lee alleges she was forced to work 40 hours per week, but was not allowed access to her checking account, and instead received a stipend of $30 per week from the church. Lee ultimately won the lawsuit and was awarded $9,215 in unpaid wages and damages. Such employment arrangements have long been a hallmark of high-control groups. In a 2012 court case, for example, former Scientology member and minister Marc Headley alleged that he was paid 39 cents an hour for work that netted a 7,400% profit for the church. He contended that the church violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act by psychologically coercing him to provide labor. The church asserted, however, that the claim failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact. The court dismissed the case. Almost all high-control groups are money-making endeavors. Another hallmark is that they prey on those who are already economically unstable. Following the Jonestown massacre in 1978, a congressional investigation determined that Jim Jones had recruited most of his followers from \u201cpoor ghetto neighborhoods.\u201d Melanie says as much of Shinn. \u201cHe targeted young people and put them to work,\u201d she explains in the series. \u201cThey were okay with it because they were never rich to begin with. They came from a low-income, immigrant family. And he would work their asses off.\u201d Around 2018, James \u201cBDash\u201d Derrick\u2014a krump dancer of growing renown\u2014began producing social media content with a videographer named Isaiah Shinn, who happens to be Robert\u2019s son. About a year later, Derrick began recommending Isaiah to other dancers in his community. Before long, the dancers were attending services at Shekinah. As one explains in the series, Robert overheard them expressing frustration with their managers. He learned how many followers they had on social media, then offered to manage them himself. It was an easy sell to budding artists, as former 7M client and Shekinah follower Kailea Gray explains in the series. \u201cA lot of young men and women travel to LA with their big dream of being onstage and get wrapped up in a lot of things that aren\u2019t fair for them. They don\u2019t get paid enough. They get overworked.... There\u2019s not a lot of opportunity and a lot of dancers. They are seeing Robert\u2019s house, watching him drive these luxury cars. That\u2019s why a place like Shekinah can look so alluring.\u201d Eventually, Shinn encouraged his \u201cclients\u201d to move into homes he owned. The series details how he began controlling with whom they danced and which songs they used for their choreography. Their musical choices shifted from avante-garde tracks to classic pop hits, such as Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cSurfin\u2019 Safari.\u201d When the dancers booked gigs, Shinn took a 20% management fee\u2014more or less the industry standard. But in addition, he\u2019d take another 30% in church donations, according to the documentary. Former member and client Aubrey Fisher explains in the series that due to various other fees imposed by Shinn, artists sometimes received only 20% of their earnings\u2014before taxes, which, of course, often hover around 20%. By January 2021, Miranda Wilking\u2014who is now married to Derrick, and has taken his last name\u2014had grown increasingly distant from her family. She refused to return to Michigan for her grandfather\u2019s funeral. Her parents, Dean and Kelly Wilking, flew to California to beg her to reconsider. As Dean and Kelly recount in the Netflix series, Miranda tried to get away from them and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll see if I can come to the funeral.\u201d They inquired, \u201cWho do you have to ask?\u201d She replied, \u201cI need to ask someone closer to God than you.\u201d A teary Dean explains on camera that is the moment he knew she was gone. Cult experts and sociologists argue that anyone can be susceptible to cult membership and indoctrination. Still, there are certain contextual patterns. Typically, people join such groups during moments of transition, when they are unmoored. This is why high-control groups recruit on college campuses, and why you hear of people joining after divorces or the loss of loved ones or jobs. Economic instability also leaves people unmoored. Cults prey on those facing hardship, those most eager to believe promises of relief, and, therefore, most susceptible to a con. Sociologists have also long argued that cult activity increases during major social transitions. Between 1975 and 2020, 50 trillion dollars moved from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%. As of 2018, Steve K. D. Eichel, former president and current board member of the International Cultic Studies Association, estimated the number of destructive groups in the United States, a.k.a. cults, to be around 10,000. America is now in a golden age of cults, buffeted not only by demographic changes and technological revolution but also by accelerating financial struggle. In Dancing for the Devil, one former member describes his dance community as \u201cperfect prey.\u201d \u201cIn the past 40 years we have seen major social changes,\u201d explains Eichel. \u201cAdd to that the growing disparity in economic wealth and power, and now those disgruntled feelings are intensified. The relationship between disgruntled peoples and the growth of authoritarian movements, including cults, has long been understood.\u201d Rick Alan Ross, founder and executive director of the Cult Education Institute, points out that \u201cIt was an economic depression in Germany and accompanying despair which provided Adolf Hitler the premise he needed to recruit an entire nation into the most destructive personality cult in modern history.\u201d In fact, there is much overlap between political extremism and quasi-religious high-control groups, which are all considered \u201cmillennial\u201d movements (in the doomsday sense of the word). One commonality among these groups is folie \u00e0 groupe, or shared psychosis in which pathological symptoms spread within a tight-knit group through emotional bonds. As the series lays out, Shinn\u2019s followers share a number of extreme beliefs, among them that he is a man of God, that abandoning one\u2019s family will secure entry into heaven, and that succumbing to Shin\u2019s sexual whims grows one closer to God. Forensic psychologist and author of Profile of a Nation: Trump\u2019s Mind, America\u2019s Soul, Bandy X. Lee has written extensively about folie \u00e0 groupe. When asked how to combat the spread of extremism in America, she first recommends \u201cfixing the socioeconomic conditions that gave rise to psychological vulnerability to these influences in the first place.\u201d In other words, if you remove the prey, you remove the predator. Still, there are more immediate concerns, particularly for the Wilkings. Doneen warns in Dancing for the Devil that Priscylla\u2019s past and current struggles are \u201ca cautionary tale for what might be happening to Miranda\u2014or what might happen if her parents and sister aren\u2019t able to get her out.\u201d", "summary": "Docuseries about alleged cults are often released after the fact.

Praised for his basketball IQ as a key piece in UConn\u2019s complex system and called \u201cCaptain America\u201d for his versatility by teammate Hassan Diarra, who is also returning for another season in Storrs, Karaban solidifies a roster built to contend again. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve enjoyed the draft process, Storrs is home,\u201d Karaban posted to X, formerly Twitter. \u201cLet\u2019s run it back.\u201d Let's run it back, @AlexKaraban pic.twitter.com/ACyM8OaTyZ \u2014 UConn Men's Basketball (@UConnMBB) May 29, 2024 Karaban, 6-foot-8, started 38 games for the Huskies during the 2022-23 national championship season and averaged 9.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game while shooting 40.2% from 3-point range. He saw an increased role in his sophomore season, averaging 13.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game, shooting 37.9% from beyond the arc. It was widely believed that the 21-year-old Southborough, Mass. native would\u2019ve been selected in the second round and might\u2019ve gotten around $2 million in guaranteed money. Evidently, the chance to go for a three-peat and enough opportunities to earn NIL money drew him back. Karaban also noted after the championship parade in Hartford that he has taken enough classes to earn his degree after three years. Referring to the decision as a \u201cwin-win\u201d when speaking with reporters at the NBA Draft Combine, Karaban took his time and met with NBA teams right up to the deadline while recognizing the opportunity to improve his draft stock as he chased history in Storrs. No program has won more than two national championships in a row since John Wooden\u2019s UCLA teams won seven consecutive from 1967-73, before the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams.

The Huskies also added Liam McNeeley, ranked the No. 9 prospect in ESPN\u2019s final 2024 rankings, to a talented freshman class that includes four-stars Ahmad Nowell and Isaiah Abraham, and will enter the 2024-25 season with high expectations again.", "summary": "Hours before the NCAA withdrawal deadline, Alex Karaban announced his decision to return to the UConn men's basketball team and compete for a third national title.", "url": "https://www.courant.com/2024/05/29/alex-karaban-withdraws-from-nba-draft-will-return-to-chase-three-peat-with-uconn-mens-basketball-team/", "image": "https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP24096775344179.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 18:55:36", "author": "Joe Arruda", "authors": ["Joe Arruda"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.028}, {"id": 225159960, "title": "Alex Karaban Withdraws from 2024 NBA Draft, Will Return to UConn After National Title", "text": "Alex Karaban is going for a three-peat.

(WFLA) \u2014 A video obtained by WFLA shows two Lakeland police officers punching a teenage boy and using a Taser on him as they tried to get him to leave an apartment complex. According to an arrest report, the officers were called to a pool at the Caroline Apartments along Griffin Road on Memorial Day after someone called to report that there were people there who didn\u2019t live at the complex. The report said the manager told police to trespass anyone who didn\u2019t live there. Police said the 16-year-old didn\u2019t provide them with an apartment number and did not identify himself, and was verbally trespassed from the property. He left the pool to get his belongings, according to the report. The report said the teen was asked to leave the property again, and put his hand in the officer\u2019s face, but that was not captured on video. He reportedly \u201ctensed his body\u201d when an officer grabbed his arm and tried to pull away.

Netflix debuted the first trailer for A Family Affair on May 29. The film stars Joey King as Zara, a young woman working as an assistant for movie star Chris Cole (Efron, 36), who becomes romantically entangled with Zara\u2019s mother (Kidman, 56). Zara quits working for Chris because of his demanding nature, narcissistic qualities and womanizing behavior, which only adds to her shock and disgust when she finds out her widowed mother is having an affair with her former boss. The rom-com\u2019s trailer puts the hilarious awkwardness of this unusual circumstance on full display, with one notable scene from the trailer showing Zara walking in on an intimate moment between Kidman and Efron's characters. Zara screams at the sight of her mother and her boss kissing \u2014 and then, as she tries to make her escape, she accidentally slams into the doorframe.

PEOPLE shared exclusive first-look photos from A Family Affair back in April, with Efron calling the upcoming flick \"funny, romantic and entertaining.\" The Iron Claw actor also told PEOPLE he was nervous as an actor in his 20s working with Kidman, and experienced similar jitters on the set of A Family Affair. \"I was still a bit apprehensive but reuniting with Nicole is always so great and as talented as she as an actress, she is equally kind, caring and wonderful to spend time with,\" Efron said, promising that their characters' chemistry in the film is \"seamless, natural and fun.\" The project marks the second romantic affair between characters of Kidman and Efron, with their 2012 movie The Paperboy featuring the pair as lovers, as well. A Family Affair also stars Liza Koshy and Kathy Bates, from a screenplay by Carrie Solomon. Director Richard LaGravenese (P.S. I Love You) told PEOPLE in April that the spark between Efron and Kidman in A Family Affair was \"an answered prayer \u2014 something you hope for but can't plan.\" \"The interplay between Joey and Zac's characters as an assistant and star is so much fun,\" added LaGravenese, 64. \"I also love the mother-daughter role reversal where the daughter becomes the disapproving, judgmental, suspicious parent and the mother is sneaking around her back having a love affair that makes her feel like she\u2019s come back to life.\" King, 24, told PEOPLE that being able to call Kidman \u2014 who was recently honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award \u2014 her onscreen mom is \"iconic.\" \"It\u2019s truly one of those moments where you have to remind yourself that it\u2019s actually your life and you\u2019re getting to work with this person, and somehow they\u2019re even more wonderful than you could imagine,\" she explained.

For Swiatek, this extended her Roland Garros winning streak to 16 matches as she pursues a third consecutive trophy at the clay-court major tournament. For Osaka, who let a 5-2 lead in the third set slip away, this amounted to an announcement that she is still capable of elite tennis. They went back-and-forth for more than 2 1/2 hours as rain loudly pelted the outside of the closed roof at Court Philippe Chatrier \u2013 showers forced the postponements of 23 singles matches until Thursday \u2013 and a riveted, if hardly full, crowd alternated their support between the two players. Sometimes, spectators called out before a point was done, prompting admonishment from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte. Osaka served for the victory at 5-3 in the final set, and held a match point there, but she put a backhand into the net. Soon, when Osaka missed another backhand, this one long, Swiatek finally converted a break point on her 10th chance of that set, and they played on. Maybe the lack of high-level matches caught up to Osaka, because she continued to fade, her mistakes mounting, including a double-fault to hand over another break that put Swiatek in control 6-5 before holding serve one last time to emerge with a difficult victory. On the men\u2019s side, Carlos Alcaraz forehand was giving him a hard time, and so was the 176th-ranked qualifier across the net. After ceding the third set and trailing by a break in the fourth, Alcaraz needed to get in gear \u2013 and he did, taking the last five games to beat Jesper de Jong 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 in the second round. Heavy rain from early in the day caused the postponement of 23 singles matches, so Alcaraz was lucky to get the chance to compete, and advance, under the retractable roof at Court Philippe Chatrier. Still, he could not quite shake de Jong, a 23-year-old from the Netherlands with a flashy game who was participating in just his second Grand Slam main draw. Alcaraz, a former No. 1 who is seeded No. 3, has won two major championships and is still just 21. But Alcaraz has been dealing with a bothersome right arm that limited his preparation for Roland Garros and, he said, made him afraid to hit his big forehand with full force. He has been wearing a white sleeve on that forearm and did so again Wednesday; perhaps it helped things, although he ended up with 26 unforced errors on the forehand side, more than half of his 47 total miscues. So while he usually takes pride in being an entertainer, and not just an athlete, he needed to recalibrate that a bit. \u201cI saw that I need to forget about putting on a show. \u2026 It was difficult for me today,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI was in trouble a little bit, but really happy to do it at the end.\u201d Only, however, after de Jong became the lowest-ranked man to win a set against Alcaraz at a major tournament, then broke to go ahead 2-1 in the fourth. Alcaraz would not drop a game the rest of the way in the 3-hour, 9-minute match. \u201cI prefer to not spend not too much time on the court,\u201d said Alcaraz, who removed his arm sleeve and donned a black windbreaker as de Jong exited toward the locker room to a standing ovation. \u201cBut every match is different.\u201d A few other matches also were played despite the rain The winners included Sofia Kenin, the champion at the Australian Open in 2020 and runner-up at the French Open later that year; and a pair of two-time major finalists, Ons Jabeur and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Jabeur advanced to the third round by defeating Camila Osorio 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, and Tsitsipas moved on with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-4 victory over Daniel Altmaier. Kenin arrived at the French Open with just a 4-13 record this season and now is into the third round at Roland Garros after eliminating 21st-seeded Caroline Garcia of France 6-3, 6-3. \u201cHer game annihilates my strong points. She takes the ball early. She changes directions. She returns quite well,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThat actually makes her difficult to outplay.\u201d", "summary": "Osaka, showing she can still play elite tennis, misses a chance to knock off the top-ranked player as Swiatek rallies for the 7-6 (1), 1-6, 7-5 win.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/05/29/naomi-osaka-loses-final-5-games-falls-to-no-1-iga-swiatek-at-french-open/", "image": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/France_Tennis_French_Open_83954-1717008956.jpg?w=1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 18:56:01", "author": "Howard Fendrich,HOWARD FENDRICH - Associated Press", "authors": ["Howard Fendrich", "HOWARD FENDRICH - Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.248}, {"id": 225214196, "title": "French Open: No. 1 Iga Swiatek fends off Naomi Osaka upset bid", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Iga Swiatek played like the current No. 1 and the two-time defending champion at the French Open. No surprise there. That Naomi Osaka looked like the former No. 1 that she is \u2014 and on clay, no less \u2014 amounted to an announcement that she is still quite capable of elite tennis. Surging down the stretch as Osaka faded, Swiatek saved a match point and grabbed the last five games to sneak her way to a 7-6 (1), 1-6, 7-5 victory in the second round of the French Open on Wednesday night in a thrill-a-minute contest befitting two women who both own four Grand Slam titles. \u201cFor sure, this match was really intense. Much more intense for the second round than I ever expected. For sure, I\u2019ll be more ready next time,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cNaomi played amazing tennis. \u2026 I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s back and she\u2019s playing well.\u201d For Swiatek, this extended her Roland Garros winning streak to 16 matches as she pursues a third consecutive trophy at the clay-court major. For Osaka, who cried when she left the court after letting a 5-2 lead in the concluding set slip away, this amounted to a return to her big-hitting best. They went back-and-forth for nearly three hours as rain loudly pelted the outside of the closed roof at Court Philippe Chatrier \u2014 showers forced the postponements of 23 singles matches until Thursday \u2014 and a riveted, if hardly full, crowd alternated their support between the two players. Sometimes, spectators called out before a point was done, prompting admonishment from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte during the match. And from Swiatek afterward. \u201cSometimes, under a lot of pressure, when you scream something during the rally or right before the return, it\u2019s really, really hard to be focused,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cThe stakes are big and there is a lot of money here to win. So losing a few points may change a lot. So please, guys, if you can support us between the rallies but not during, that would be really, really amazing.\u201d Osaka served for the victory at 5-3 in the final set, and was a point away from winning, but she put a backhand into the net. Soon, when Osaka missed another backhand, this one long, Swiatek finally converted a break point on her 10th chance of that set, and they played on. Maybe the lack of high-level matches caught up to Osaka, because her mistakes continued to mount, including a double-fault that put Swiatek in control 6-5. Swiatek, who has led the WTA rankings for nearly every week since April 2022, then held serve one last time. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily feel like I regret anything,\u201d Osaka said. Still, this was, without a doubt, Osaka\u2019s top performance since she returned to the tour in January after 15 months away while becoming a mother. (Her daughter, who is 10 months old now, accompanied Osaka to Paris and recently started walking.) \u201cI was watching Iga win this tournament last year, and I was pregnant. It was just my dream to be able to play her,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cWhen I kind of think of it like that, I think I\u2019m doing pretty well. And I\u2019m also just trying not to be too hard on myself. I feel like I played her on her better surface. I\u2019m a hard-court kid, so I would love to play her on my surface and see what happens.\u201d Because of the weather, only nine matches were completed Wednesday, and winners included Coco Gauff, Ons Jabeur, Sofia Kenin, Carlos Alcaraz, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev. It\u2019s been a few years since Osaka played this capably and confidently, hammering big serves at up to 122 mph (197 kph) and imposing groundstrokes. Her quick-strike capabilities were on full display: Osaka won 82 of the 139 points (59%) that lasted four strokes or fewer, and she finished with a 54-37 advantage in total winners. All of those familiar mannerisms were back, too. She turned her back to Swiatek to reset between points, hopped in place, tugged at her pink visor\u2019s brim and slapped her palm on her thigh. Osaka celebrated points by shaking a clenched fist and shouting \u201cCome on!\u201d She grabbed nine of 10 games to dominate the second set and lead 3-0 in the third. Then 4-1. Then 5-2. As one ball or another would fly past Swiatek, zipped near a corner or right at a line, she turned toward her guest box and shot a look of confusion or concern in the direction of her coach and her sports psychologist. \u201cI felt for most of the match that I wasn\u2019t really (in the) here and now,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cMy mind was, like, playing around sometimes.\u201d She\u2019s not used to this sort of one-way traffic coming head-on in her direction. Normally, it\u2019s Swiatek who is delivering lopsided sets at a foe\u2019s expense, especially on clay. She now has won her last 14 matches this month, with titles on the surface at Madrid and Rome \u2014 a clay double no woman had done since Serena Williams in 2013. But this marked a sudden return to the Osaka everyone came to expect, match in and match out, back when she was at the height of her powers, climbing atop the rankings and gathering two trophies apiece at the U.S. Open and Australian Open from late 2018 to early 2021. It was in May 2021 that Osaka withdrew from the French Open before her second-round match, explaining that she experiences \u201chuge waves of anxiety\u201d before speaking to the media and revealing she had dealt with depression. She took time away from the tour for a mental health break, then opted for another hiatus after her title defense at the U.S. Open a few months later ended with a third-round loss. She helped usher in a change in the way athletes, sports fans and society at large understood the importance of mental health \u2014 and prompted those in charge of various sports, including tennis, to take the issue seriously and try to accommodate and protect them better. Osaka entered with an 0-4 record on the red stuff against opponents ranked in the top 10 and never has been past the third round at Roland Garros. This also would have been her first win anywhere against a top-10 opponent since January 2020. Instead, though, it is Swiatek who moves on and continues her bid to become the first woman with three championships in a row in Paris since Justine Henin in 2007-09.", "summary": "The two-time defending champion saves a match point and wins the last five games to defeat the former top-ranked player in the second round", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/05/29/french-open-no-1-iga-swiatek-fends-off-naomi-osaka-upset-bid/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24150607383954.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 21:41:00", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.209}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225079086, "title": "Kate Middleton \u2018turned a corner\u2019 with cancer treatment during \u2018worrying time': report", "text": "Kate Middleton has \"turned a corner\" with her cancer treatment as the Princess of Wales continues her recovery behind palace doors.

It includes air defense, artillery ammunition and armored vehicles. Swedish Defense Minister P\u00e5l Jonsson reiterated that the country has ruled out for now sending any Swedish-built JAS 39 Gripen jets to Ukraine, saying the focus on the Ukrainian side is on implementing a F-16 fighter jet program. Several countries have said they want to donate F-16s. On Tuesday, Belgium pledged 30 F-16 jets to Ukraine. Jonsson said Sweden \u201cis still working on possibly being able to contribute with the Gripen system later.\u201d Zelensky Vows Russia Will Feel \u2018Wrath\u2019 of Ukraine With Arrival of Western F-16 Fighter Jets in New Yearhttps://t.co/zpgv4ICuOe \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 1, 2024 The donation also includes two Swedish-made SAAB ASCC airborne early warning and control airplanes, which Jonsson said would have the \u201cgreatest effect on the Ukrainian air defense\u201d because it would complement and reinforce the promised donations of American F-16 fighter jets. \u201cYou can identify incoming cruise missiles, you can identify drones and identify targets both on land and at sea,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall assessment is that a donation of the ASCC 890 radar reconnaissance and command aircraft would be the most impactful for the Ukrainian Air Force right now,\u201d Jonsson added. The donation of the two airborne early warning and control airplanes means \u201ca temporary decline in the Swedish defense capability,\u201d Jonsson said. The donation also includes a missile system that can be used both on aircraft and in ground-based air defense systems, he said. It will be donated to Ukraine through cooperation with the United States, Jonsson said. The support package is the 16th from Sweden since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.

Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said during a court hearing that additional people have come forward with assault claims and prosecutors are currently assessing which fall under the statute of limitations. She said some potential survivors that were not ready to step forward during Weinstein\u2019s first trial may now be willing to testify. When asked by Judge Curtis Farber whether there was a possibility of prosecutors filing a new indictment, Blumberg replied: \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d Weinstein appeared before the judge Wednesday afternoon in the same New York City courthouse where former President Donald Trump is on trial. He entered the court in a wheelchair, as he has during other recent court hearings after his 2020 conviction was tossed out. Blumberg said prosecutors would be in a better position to update the court on the direction of the case at the end of June. The retrial on the rape charge is tentatively scheduled for some time after Labor Day. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, also addressed a letter prosecutors sent to the judge l ast week asking him to remind Weinstein\u2019s lawyers not to discuss or disparage potential witnesses in public ahead of the retrial. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office argues that Aidala made statements earlier this month that were meant to intimidate Miriam Haley, a former TV and film production assistant who Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting. Aidala apologized to the judge but said he didn\u2019t intend to intimidate anyone and that it is the defense\u2019s position that \u201clies were told at the last trial, and will be told at this one.\u201d Farber, in response, directed both sides to \u201crefrain from pandering to press,\u201d saying the case will \u201cnot be decided in the court of public opinion\u201d but in the court of justice. He also set the next court date for July 9. Weinstein\u2019s original trial was held in the same courtroom where Trump is on trial now, but the two men were unlikely to bump into each other. Weinstein is in custody and was brought to and from the courtroom under guard. He appeared in a courtroom on a different floor than where Trump is currently on trial. At his 2020 trial, Weinstein was convicted of raping Jessica Mann, an aspiring actor, and of sexually assaulting Haley. But last month New York\u2019s highest court threw out those convictions after determining that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that weren\u2019t part of the case. Weinstein, 72, has maintained that any sexual activity was consensual. The New York ruling reopened a painful chapter in America\u2019s reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures. The #MeToo era began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein. Speaking outside of court on May 1, Aidala said Haley lied to the jury about her motive in coming forward and that his team planned an aggressive cross-examination on the issue \u201cif she dares to come and show her face here.\u201d Haley has said she does not want to go through the trauma of testifying again, \u201cbut for the sake of keeping going and doing the right thing and because it is what happened, I would consider it.\u201d The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as both Haley and Mann have. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence in New York, was also convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and is still sentenced to 16 years in prison in California.

She added that Judge Merchan \u201calso presided over the criminal trial against the Trump Organization and will be presiding over the criminal trial of Steve Bannon,\u201d who was a senior adviser to the former president while he was in the White House. Ms. Stefanik noted in her letter that there are about three dozen judges eligible to oversee the Trump-related cases, but Judge Merchan, who is an acting justice, was selected for three of the cases related to the former president and presumptive Republican nominee for the White House in 2024. \u201cIf justices were indeed being randomly assigned in the Criminal Term, the probability of two specific criminal cases being assigned to the same justice is quite low, and the probability of three specific criminal cases being assigned to the same justice is infinitesimally small. And yet, we see Acting Justice Merchan on all three cases,\u201d she wrote. Her letter made reference to Judge Merchan\u2019s donations to the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, while adding his daughter is in charge of a consulting company that works with Democratic officials. \u201cOne cannot help but suspect that the \u2018random selection\u2019 at work in the assignment of Acting Justice Merchan, a Democrat Party donor, to these cases involving prominent Republicans, is in fact not random at all,\u201d the lawmaker added in her letter. The Epoch Times contacted the Supreme Court of the State of New York and the New York State Office of Court Administration for comment. In a statement to media outlets, the New York State Office of Court Administration said that the judge\u2019s assignment to the Trump criminal case followed standard protocol. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said repeatedly, including in April 2023, Judge Merchan was assigned to supervise the special grand juries that investigated the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg as well as Donald Trump,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe was, in turn, assigned the indictments that arose from those investigations, which is common practice since the judge supervising the grand jury investigation already has some familiarity with these often-complex cases and can manage them more efficiently.\u201d In response to President Trump\u2019s lawyers\u2019 claims about having a conflict of interest, Judge Merchan in mid-April declined to recuse himself from the case and denied his request. A complaint submitted by his attorneys said that the judge has a conflict of interest because of his daughter\u2019s consulting work. But Judge Merchan said on the opening day of the criminal trial that his attorneys \u201cfailed to provide\u201d evidence showing he has a conflict of interest in the case, adding the claims were based on a \u201cseries of inferences\u201d and \u201cinnuendos.\u201d The judge also stated that \u201cthere is no agenda here,\u201d adding that \u201dwe want to follow the law.\u201d A gag order was issued against President Trump by Judge Merchan earlier this year, arguing that his comments on social media and in public would put undue pressure on potential witnesses, jury members, and others connected to the trial. Under the order, President Trump is allowed to be critical of the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the case. Last year, President Trump was indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to repayments to a former associate and former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to allegedly purchase the silence of women who made claims about affairs with the former president, which he has denied. Prosecutors say the plan was an attempt to interfere with the 2016 election. The former president has pleaded not guilty, saying that the trial is an attempt to keep him off the campaign trail for the 2024 presidential election and designed to harm his reelection chances. On Wednesday, the jury is slated to start their deliberations after both prosecutors and the defense make their closing arguments in the case. The judge told jurors on Wednesday: \u201cIt is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump has not publicly signaled who he might select as his 2024 running mate, but there has been media-driven speculation that she might be vying for the spot. She previously said that she would be \u201chonored\u201d to serve in a Trump administration \u201cin any capacity.\u201d The former president has said he will not select his running mate before the Republican National Convention in July.", "summary": "Judge Juan Merchan's selection may not be 'not random at all,' Rep.

According to Federal Election Commission records, the Post reported, Merchan contributed $15 to the \"Biden for President\" campaign, $10 to the Progressive Turnout Project, and another $10 to Stop Republicans. \"The simple answer to why Acting Justice Merchan has been assigned to these cases would seem to be that whoever made the assignment intentionally selected Acting Justice Merchan to handle them to increase the chance that Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, and Steven Bannon would ultimately be convicted,\" Stefanik declared.

Helen Toner, one of four people responsible for firing OpenAI\u2019s CEO, says Altman\u2019s incessant lying created a toxic culture that executives described as \u201cpsychological abuse.\u201d In her first long-form interview since Sam Altman\u2019s firing, Toner tells The Ted AI Show that executives came to OpenAI\u2019s board in October 2023 with serious allegations against the company\u2019s CEO. According to Toner, two executives said they couldn\u2019t trust Altman and showed the board screenshots of Altman\u2019s manipulation and lying. These executives reportedly said they had no belief that Altman could or would change, and their testimonies pushed the Board to fire the CEO weeks later. This interview, released on Tuesday, comes after weeks of public backlash against OpenAI where the company\u2019s truthfulness has been called into question by Scarlett Johansson and former employees. \u201cFor any individual case, Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous-sounding explanation of why it wasn\u2019t a big deal or why it was misinterpreted or whatever,\u201d Toner said in the interview. \u201cAfter years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him came to the conclusion that we just couldn\u2019t believe things that Sam was telling us.\u201d But the writing was on the wall about Altman\u2019s purported lying for years, according to Toner. She says the Board was not informed in advance when ChatGPT came out in November 2022, and \u201clearned about ChatGPT on Twitter.\u201d Toner also noted that Altman gave inaccurate information about the safety processes at OpenAI. In the weeks before Altman was fired, Toner claims he lied to other board members to try to get her fired after she wrote a research paper that spoke negatively about OpenAI\u2019s safety practices. Ultimately, Toner says OpenAI\u2019s board members told no one except its legal team they would try to fire Altman because they knew the CEO would try to undermine them if he caught wind of it. But even after all this, Altman came back as CEO just a few days later, with 95% of the company signing an open letter to reinstate him. Toner says this was presented as a black-and-white decision to employees within the company: either bring Altman back or OpenAI is destroyed. The security and valuation of the company were especially important, according to Toner, because OpenAI employees would make a lot of money from their equity in the $86 billion company via a tender offer a few months later. \u201cThe second thing that is really important to know, that has really gone underreported, is how scared people are to go against Sam,\u201d Toner said. \u201cThey experienced him retaliating against people, retaliating against them, for past instances of being critical. They were really afraid of what might happen to them.\u201d Lastly, Toner noted that this is not the first company where Altman has run into this problem. The former OpenAI board member brought up that Altman was fired from Y Combinator in 2019, which the Washington Post reported in the wake of his firing from OpenAI. Toner also said the management team at Loopt, Altman\u2019s first startup, went to the company\u2019s board twice and asked them to fire Altman for \u201cdeceptive and chaotic behavior.\u201d Toner, Tasha McCauley, Ilya Sutskever, and Adam D\u2019Angelo were the board members responsible for firing Sam Altman last November. Toner and McCauley immediately left the OpenAI board when Altman returned to power later that month. Sutskever just announced his departure this month, after reportedly being absent from OpenAI\u2019s office for about six months. In response to this flurry of allegations, the podcast included a response from OpenAI\u2019s board chair Bret Taylor. \u201cWe are disappointed that Ms. Toner continues to revisit these issues,\u201d Taylor said, then citing the law firm Wilmer Hale\u2019s independent investigation into these issues. \u201cThe review concluded that the prior board\u2019s decision was not based on concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI\u2019s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners.\u201d This interview comes after weeks of turmoil for OpenAI, where the company\u2019s trustworthiness is increasingly coming into public light. OpenAI has also come under fire for strict exit contracts that muzzle former employees and threaten to claw back their equity (the company has withdrawn these contracts in light of public backlash). Lastly, OpenAI has seen the departure of several high-ranking AI safety researchers, many of who had issued a call of warning about the company as they left. Six months after the Altman firing debacle, OpenAI\u2019s trust issues do not seem to be going away anytime soon.

A key reason for the delay in rate cuts is that the inflation pressures that are bedeviling the economy are being driven largely by lingering forces from the pandemic \u2014 for items ranging from apartment rents to auto insurance to hospital prices. Though Fed officials say they expect inflation in those areas to eventually cool, they\u2019ve signaled that they\u2019re prepared to wait as long as it takes. Yet the policymakers\u2019 willingness to keep their key rate at a two-decade peak \u2014 thereby keeping costs painfully high for mortgages, auto loans and other forms of consumer borrowing \u2014 carries its own risks. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to strike a balance between keeping rates high enough to control inflation yet not so high as to damage the job market. While most measures show that growth and hiring remain healthy, some gauges of the economy have begun to reveal signs of weakness. The longer the Fed keeps its benchmark rate elevated, the greater the risk of causing a downturn. At the same time, with polls showing that costlier rents, groceries and gasoline are angering voters as the presidential campaign intensifies, Donald Trump has sought to pin the blame for higher prices squarely on President Joe Biden. The Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, raised its benchmark rate by 5 percentage points from March 2022 through June 2023 \u2014 the fastest such increase in four decades \u2014 to try to drive inflation back down to its 2% target. According to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, inflation has tumbled from 7.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in March. That same gauge showed, though, that prices accelerated in the first three months of 2024, disrupting last year\u2019s steady slowdown. On Friday, economists expect the government to report that this measure rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier. A separate inflation indicator that the government reported this month suggested that prices cooled slightly in April. But with inflation remaining stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s target level, Wall Street traders now expect just one rate cut this year, in November. And even that is hardly a slam-dunk, with investors placing the likelihood of a cut in November at 63%, down from 77% a week ago. Last week, economists at Goldman Sachs became the latest analysts to give up on a rate cut in July, pushing back their forecast for the first of two cuts they expect this year to September. Oxford Economics made a similar call last month. Bank of America foresees just one Fed rate cut this year, in December. Just months ago, many economists had forecast the first rate cut for March of this year. \u201cWe will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to have a clearer picture of the inflation outlook,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month. \u201cI now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2% goal than I previously thought.\u201d (Mester is among 12 officials who are voting on the Fed\u2019s rate policy this year.) As further data accumulates, so do some signs that the economy is cooling a bit. More Americans, particularly younger adults, are falling behind on their credit card bills, for example, with the share of card debt 90 days or more overdue reaching 10.7% in the first quarter, according to the Fed\u2019s New York branch. That\u2019s the highest proportion in 14 years. Hiring is also slowing, with businesses posting fewer open jobs, though job advertisements remain high. And more companies, including Target, McDonalds and Burger King, are highlighting price cuts or cheaper deals to try to attract financially squeezed consumers. Their actions could help lower inflation in the coming months. But they also underscore the struggles that lower-income Americans face. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of signs that consumers are kind of losing some steam and hiring demand is cooling,\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist who is president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cYou could see more of a slowdown.\u201d But Coronado and other economists also regard the latest trends as a sign that the economy may simply be normalizing after a period of rapid growth. Companies are still hiring, though at a more modest pace than at the start of the year. And data suggests that Americans traveled in record numbers over the Memorial Day weekend, a sign they\u2019re confident in their finances. One reason why inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s target is that distortions stemming from the pandemic are still keeping prices elevated in several areas even as much of the rest of the economy has moved past the pandemic. Housing costs, led by apartment rents, jumped two years ago after many Americans sought additional living space during the pandemic. Rental costs are now slowing: They rose 5.4% in April on an annual basis, down from 8.8% a year earlier. But they\u2019re still rising faster than before the pandemic. Last month, rent and homeownership, along with hotel prices, accounted for two-thirds of the annual rise in \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs. Powell and other Fed officials have acknowledged that they had expected rents to fall more quickly than they have. The cost of a new lease, though, has tumbled since mid-2022. A gauge of newly leased apartment rents calculated by the government shows that they rose just 0.4% in the first three months of 2024 compared with a year earlier. Yet it takes time for newer, lower-priced rents to feed into the government\u2019s inflation measure. \u201cMarket rents adjust more quickly to economic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants,\u201d Philip Jefferson, the Fed\u2019s vice chair and a top lieutenant to Powell, said last week. \u201cThis lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.\u201d The cost of auto insurance has soared nearly 23% from a year earlier, a huge jump that reflects the surge in prices of new and used cars during the pandemic. Insurance companies now must pay more to replace totaled cars and as a result are charging their customers more. \u201cThis is about stuff that happened in 2021,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cYou cannot go back and change that.\u201d", "summary": "Though Fed officials say they expect inflation in those areas to eventually cool, they\u2019ve signaled that they\u2019re prepared to wait as long as it takes.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/05/inflation-pressures-lingering-from-pandemic-are-keeping-fed-rate-cuts-on-pause.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/GL3ZTDCG4ZEGFEJITVFOBJO7OM.jpg?auth=d67a63306b5cc58dfa1c535c97b9a7db5abf0bb196c630f657b673b320eaacaa&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 11:53:08", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.237}, {"id": 225030004, "title": "Inflation pressures remaining from pandemic are keeping Fed rate cuts on pause", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hopes for interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve are steadily fading, with a stream of recent remarks by Fed officials underscoring their intention to keep borrowing costs high as long as needed to curb persistently elevated inflation.

A key reason for the delay in rate cuts is that the inflation pressures that are bedeviling the economy are being driven largely by lingering forces from the pandemic \u2013 for items ranging from apartment rents to auto insurance to hospital prices. Though Fed officials say they expect inflation in those areas to eventually cool, they\u2019ve signaled that they\u2019re prepared to wait as long as it takes. Yet the policymakers\u2019 willingness to keep their key rate at a two-decade peak \u2013 thereby keeping costs painfully high for mortgages, auto loans and other forms of consumer borrowing \u2013 carries its own risks. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to strike a balance between keeping rates high enough to control inflation yet not so high as to damage the job market. While most measures show that growth and hiring remain healthy, some gauges of the economy have begun to reveal signs of weakness. The longer the Fed keeps its benchmark rate elevated, the greater the risk of causing a downturn. At the same time, with polls showing that costlier rents, groceries and gasoline are angering voters as the presidential campaign intensifies, Donald Trump has sought to pin the blame for higher prices squarely on President Joe Biden. The Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, raised its benchmark rate by 5 percentage points from March 2022 through June 2023 \u2013 the fastest such increase in four decades \u2013 to try to drive inflation back down to its 2% target. According to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, inflation has tumbled from 7.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in March. That same gauge showed, though, that prices accelerated in the first three months of 2024, disrupting last year\u2019s steady slowdown. On Friday, economists expect the government to report that this measure rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier. A separate inflation indicator that the government reported this month suggested that prices cooled slightly in April. But with inflation remaining stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s target level, Wall Street traders now expect just one rate cut this year, in November. And even that is hardly a slam-dunk, with investors placing the likelihood of a cut in November at 63%, down from 77% a week ago. Last week, economists at Goldman Sachs became the latest analysts to give up on a rate cut in July, pushing back their forecast for the first of two cuts they expect this year to September. Oxford Economics made a similar call last month. Bank of America foresees just one Fed rate cut this year, in December. Just months ago, many economists had forecast the first rate cut for March of this year. \u201cWe will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to have a clearer picture of the inflation outlook,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month. \u201cI now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2% goal than I previously thought.\u201d (Mester is among 12 officials who are voting on the Fed\u2019s rate policy this year.) As further data accumulates, so do some signs that the economy is cooling a bit. More Americans, particularly younger adults, are falling behind on their credit card bills, for example, with the share of card debt 90 days or more overdue reaching 10.7% in the first quarter, according to the Fed\u2019s New York branch. That\u2019s the highest proportion in 14 years. Hiring is also slowing, with businesses posting fewer open jobs, though job advertisements remain high. And more companies, including Target, McDonalds and Burger King, are highlighting price cuts or cheaper deals to try to attract financially squeezed consumers. Their actions could help lower inflation in the coming months. But they also underscore the struggles that lower-income Americans face. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of signs that consumers are kind of losing some steam and hiring demand is cooling,\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist who is president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cYou could see more of a slowdown.\u201d But Coronado and other economists also regard the latest trends as a sign that the economy may simply be normalizing after a period of rapid growth. Companies are still hiring, though at a more modest pace than at the start of the year. And data suggests that Americans traveled in record numbers over the Memorial Day weekend, a sign they\u2019re confident in their finances. The Fed\u2019s reluctance to cut rates is likely to set it apart from some of its counterparts overseas in the coming months. Central bankers in Europe and the United Kingdom are expected to reduce borrowing costs as soon as next month, largely because inflation has fallen further in those areas than in the United States. Rising prices in Europe and the U.K. were driven mostly by spiking energy costs stemming from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and those costs have largely receded. The U.K. and European economies have also fared much worse than the U.S. economy since the pandemic, so inflation has not been as serious a threat. The economies of the U.K. and the 20 countries that use the euro currency actually shrank in the second half of last year before recording mild growth in the first three months of 2024. The U.K. economy has barely grown in the past 12 months. In the U.S., a big reason why inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s target is that distortions stemming from the pandemic are still keeping prices elevated in several areas even as much of the rest of the economy has moved past the pandemic. Housing costs, led by apartment rents, jumped two years ago after many Americans sought additional living space during the pandemic. Rental costs are now slowing: They rose 5.4% in April on an annual basis, down from 8.8% a year earlier. But they\u2019re still rising faster than before the pandemic. Last month, rent and homeownership, along with hotel prices, accounted for two-thirds of the annual rise in \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs. Powell and other Fed officials have acknowledged that they had expected rents to fall more quickly than they have. The cost of a new lease, though, has tumbled since mid-2022. A gauge of newly leased apartment rents calculated by the government shows that they rose just 0.4% in the first three months of 2024 compared with a year earlier. Yet it takes time for newer, lower-priced rents to feed into the government\u2019s inflation measure. \u201cMarket rents adjust more quickly to economic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants,\u201d Philip Jefferson, the Fed\u2019s vice chair and a top lieutenant to Powell, said last week. \u201cThis lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.\u201d The cost of auto insurance has soared nearly 23% from a year earlier, a huge jump that reflects the surge in prices of new and used cars during the pandemic.

Bob Menendez drip-by-drip on Tuesday, showing jurors a steady stream of documents, emails and phone records that they\u2019ll explain more thoroughly later in the trial. The evidence was being shown to Manhattan federal court jurors through the testimony of an FBI agent as the government slowly presents its case against the Democratic lawmaker. Menendez, 70, is on trial with two New Jersey businessmen who prosecutors say paid him bribes, including gold bars and cash, over the last seven years so that he\u2019d use his power as a senator to help them out. All three have pleaded not guilty. The trial, in its third week, resumed for the first time in a week. Some evidence being presented without commentary probably seemed familiar to jurors based on earlier testimony and opening statements. For instance, prosecutors had asserted that the senator aided the Egyptian government by giving it sensitive information, including the number of Americans and Egyptians who worked at the U.S. embassy. Jurors were shown a progression of text messages, emails and phone records that showed that Menendez requested that information in early May 2018 and then passed it along to his then-girlfriend, Nadine Arslanian. She relayed that information to Wael Hana, a businessman who prosecutors said parlayed his connections to Egyptian officials and friendship with Arslanian and the senator into a deal that enabled his company to monopolize the certification of all meat exported from the U.S. to Egypt as adhering to Islamic dietary requirements. Hana, one of two businessmen on trial with Menendez, then relayed the facts to an Egyptian official, according to the evidence shown to jurors. Earlier in the trial, a U.S. diplomat formerly based in Egypt testified that the cost of certifying the meat rose dramatically after Hana\u2019s company gained control of a certification process that had previously been handled by four companies. Defense lawyers, though, say the details about the makeup of staff at the U.S. embassy already was in public documents and was not sensitive information. Menendez, who began dating Arslanian in 2018, married her in 2020. Now known as Nadine Menendez, she is charged in the case as well, but her trial was postponed until at least July after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and needed immediate treatment.

Now third-seeded Minnesota heads home for Game 5 on Thursday night to see if it can make the series even more interesting against No. 5 seed Dallas. Luka Doncic had 28 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in his sixth triple-double of these playoffs, but he and co-star Kyrie Irving were just 13 of 39 from the field. Irving, who was 14-0 in his career in closeout games coming in, finished with 16 points. The Wolves have led in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter of every game in the series, and this time they finished.

Finch flirted with a second technical, which would have meant an ejection, a few minutes later when Edwards was called for his fourth foul going for a steal against Daniel Gafford.

Now they\u2019ll try to be just the fourth to force at least six games. Mike Conley scored 14 points for Minnesota, and Rudy Gobert had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Jaden Hardy scored 10 of his 13 points in a 3:38 stretch that spilled into the first bucket of the fourth quarter, a corner 3 that pulled Dallas within two.

Jaden Hardy scored 10 of his 13 points in a 3:38 stretch that spilled into the first bucket of the fourth quarter, a corner 3 that pulled Dallas within two. Four of the game\u2019s 11 lead changes came in the fourth. The Mavs were without rookie center Dereck Lively II, who injured his neck when Towns accidentally kneed him in back of the head in Game 3. Maxi Kleber, who has been out since May 3 with a separated shoulder, returned to give Dallas another option inside. But Daniel Gafford didn\u2019t have his regular tag team partner as a rim protector at center, and the Wolves shot a series-best 53% from the field. ___ By SCHUYLER DIXON AP Sports Writer", "summary": "<p>DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns finally found his rhythm, and the Timberwolves finally closed a game in the Western Conference&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/towns-edwards-lift-wolves-over-mavs-105-100-to-avoid-sweep-in-west-finals/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Towns, Edwards Lift Wolves over Mavs 105-100 to Avoid Sweep in West Finals</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/towns-edwards-lift-wolves-over-mavs-105-100-to-avoid-sweep-in-west-finals/\">Towns, Edwards Lift Wolves over Mavs 105-100 to Avoid Sweep in West Finals</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/towns-edwards-lift-wolves-over-mavs-105-100-to-avoid-sweep-in-west-finals/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24150115846294.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:17", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.361}]}, {"news": [{"id": 224979484, "title": "Israel Used U.S.-Made Bombs in Rafah Strike That Killed Dozens: Live Updates", "text": "John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, said the deaths were \u201cdevastating\u201d but that the scale of the attack was not enough to change U.S. policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a major ground operation,\u201d Mr. Kirby told reporters. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that.\u201d Israeli tanks were on the outskirts of the city \u201cto try to put pressure on Hamas,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. He also offered a measure of specificity about Mr. Biden\u2019s warning to Israel, which critics have said was too vague. \u201cWe have not seen them go in with large units and large numbers of troops in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cEverything that we can see tells us that they are not moving in in a major ground operation in population centers in the city of Rafah.\u201d Mr. Biden has faced pressure from advocates and members of his own party to use his power to curtail arms to Israel as a way to influence its conduct in the war. The United States is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, which raises questions about American responsibility as the death toll mounts. The strike in Rafah on Sunday ignited a deadly fire and killed at least 45 people, including children, and wounded 249, according to the Gazan health ministry. It has prompted international outrage, including from leaders in the European Union, the United Nations, Egypt and China. Vice President Kamala Harris, asked about Rafah on Tuesday, said \u201cthe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe\u201d the deaths. She did not answer a follow-up question about whether the strike crossed a red line for Mr. Biden. Still, the Israeli military\u2019s conduct was similar to what Mr. Biden said he would not tolerate when he warned, in an interview on CNN earlier this month, that the United States would not supply Israel with weapons to attack Rafah. \u201cI have made it clear to Bibi and the war cabinet they\u2019re not going to get our support if, in fact, they\u2019re going into these population centers,\u201d Mr. Biden said in the interview. In that interview, Mr. Biden emphasized that the United States would still ensure Israel\u2019s security, citing the Iron Dome missile defense system and his support for Israel\u2019s \u201cability to respond to attacks.\u201d But he said he would block the delivery of weapons that could be fired into densely populated areas of Rafah. The area that was hit on Sunday was not included in evacuation orders that Israel issued in early May, and some Palestinians sheltering in the camp said they had believed it was a safe zone. The Israeli military said that the target of Sunday\u2019s strike was a Hamas compound, and that \u201cprecise munitions\u201d had been used to target a commander and another senior official there. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a \u201ctragic accident\u201d that civilians were killed. Around one million people have fled Rafah during Israel\u2019s assault on the city, according to the United Nations, including many in the western part of the city and in the area around the camp that was struck on Sunday. A State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said the United States was watching Israel\u2019s investigation of the incident closely. \u201cIsrael has said that it might have been that there was a Hamas ammo dump near the area where they took the strike,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important factual question that needs to be answered.\u201d The Israeli military\u2019s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told a news conference that Israeli jets had fired the \u201csmallest munitions\u201d that they could use and added that \u201cour munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size.\u201d Israel invaded Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7 killed some 1,200 people in Israel. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 36,000 people, many of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza. World leaders, including Mr. Biden, have warned of the dangers of a major military operation in Rafah without a proper plan for evacuating the displaced Gazans taking refuge there. Mr. Miller was able to provide little detail on hundreds of thousands of people who have fled Rafah in recent weeks. \u201cSome of them have gone back to Khan Younis,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them have pushed into western Rafah. Some of them have gone to Mawasi. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one answer.\u201d Mr. Miller said he did not know if Israel was assisting those people. Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and an adviser to Palestinian leaders during past peace negotiations, said the White House was benefiting from its ambiguous descriptions on Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d for Israel\u2019s military operation in Rafah. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely blurry and by design,\u201d Mr. Elgindy said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be pinned down. They don\u2019t want to pin themselves down by identifying an exact point or line that gets across because Israel will absolutely cross that line. We\u2019ve seen that over and over again.\u201d Erica L.

It's a very unique round.\"Photos and videos used to identify the bomb remnants were taken by journalist Alam Sadeq in Gaza, who visited the scene of the strike early on Monday.He told CBS News he was searching the area, including around damaged tents that had once housed civilians, when he identified several pieces of shrapnel with English words on them.He said he recognized the words from bomb remnants he had seen after a previous strike on a building in Gaza, so he gathered the fragments together in a pile and photographed them.\"The whole actuator assembly is unique,\" Ball told CBS News, explaining his identification process using the images of the shrapnel from the scene. \"It's just not in other rounds.\"Richard Weir, senior researcher in the Crisis, Conflict and Arms division at Human Rights Watch, agreed with Ball.\"One of the critical elements here, right, is\u2026 the tail section. Sometimes it's referred to as the control section or the actuator section, which moves the fins in the rear. That matches up directly with the GBU-39 small diameter bomb, which is U.S. made,\" Weir said. \"It also matches with the idea of the description of the size of the warhead, in terms of the explosive weight.\"Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a briefing on Tuesday that the Israeli strike on Rafah \"was based on precise intelligence that indicated that these terrorists who were responsible for orchestrating and executing terror attacks against Israelis were meeting inside the specific structure we targeted.\"Hagari said that \"the strike was conducted using two munitions with small warheads, suited for this targeted strike. We're talking about munitions with 17 kilos of explosive material. This is the smallest munition that our jets can use. Following the strike a large fire ignited for reasons that are still being investigated. Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size.\"After the deadly strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a \"tragic mishap\" and that Israel was investigating. He did not elaborate.Weir said the bomb was \"a very small weapon as far as air dropped munitions,\" but that it still carries \"severe risk,\" especially when used near populated areas. He told CBS News that it wasn't the smallest weapon that could have been used to carry out a precision strike.\"Israel has plenty of other munitions, in fact, that it has used in the past, in the fighting in Gaza and elsewhere,\" Weir said. \"So it has other options available. It's just simply not the case that this was the only weapon that they could use to strike a target in, or near, a densely populated, internally displaced persons camp.\"\"I don't know enough about the aircraft integration, but it's not the smallest munition they have for precision strikes,\" Ball, the former bomb diffuser, said. \"They commonly use drone-employed weapons that have a much smaller effective area.\"Both Weir and Ball also said that a bomb of any size could potentially start a fire.\"Explosives release a lot of heat when they explode, and they can often cause fires,\" Ball said. \"Technically, if you drop one in the desert and there's no fuel around, yeah, it can't cause a fire on its own, because there's no fuel to burn. But you're dropping it in an area where there's a lot of other flammable materials, from people living and being in camps\u2026 it could easily have caused a fire.\"Emmet Lyons in London and Marwan al-Ghoul in Gaza contributed to this report.", "summary": "Analysis of images of shrapnel gathered at the scene of an Israeli strike in Rafah on Sunday showed evidence of a bomb that was a U.S.-made GBU-39", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-made-bomb-israeli-strike-rafah-munitions-experts-say/", "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/29/2ac97ab7-6669-4978-a61e-a7447e2b979f/thumbnail/1200x630/f087a07a92b2edfa006e41d68e762af8/whatsapp-image-2024-05-29-at-12-49-40.jpg?v=c5044be0004eac09882c007ac02fef6d", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2943939_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 15:35:09", "author": "Haley Ott", "authors": ["Haley Ott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.188}]}, {"news": [{"id": 225039444, "title": "Six most expensive homes sold in North Ridgeville, May 20-26", "text": "A house that sold for $625,000 tops the list of the most expensive residential real estate sales in North Ridgeville in the past week.

But in some Indigenous villages, men have all the power", "text": "PLAN DE AYALA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 At 4:30 a.m., the girls and women begin to appear in the dark streets of this rural village of Tojolabal people in southern Mexico. They walk in silence. Some are headed to grind corn to make their family\u2019s tortillas. Others fetch firewood to carry home, on their backs or with the help of a donkey. The youngest hurry to finish chores before running to school. Hours later, it\u2019s still morning, and it\u2019s time to talk. A group of young women and men gathers in a classroom at the Plan de Ayala high school. They\u2019ve come to discuss gender equality and reflect on the role of women in this remote Indigenous community in Chiapas, Mexico\u2019s poorest state. Jeydi Hern\u00e1ndez, 17, wants to be a veterinarian and play basketball, though her first attempt to form a team failed: \u201cThere were 12 of us, but my friends got married, and there were only four of us left.\u201d Mada\u00ed G\u00f3mez, 18, complains that she can\u2019t express opinions in her town: \u201cThey think women don\u2019t know anything.\u201d Two Indigenous women lead the workshop, and dozens attend. Years ago, such an initiative would not have been so well-received, they say. But change is coming \u2014 albeit slowly. Seventy years ago, Mexican women won the right to vote, and today the country is on the verge of electing its first woman president. Yet some of the Indigenous women who will vote in Sunday\u2019s national election still don\u2019t have a voice in their own homes and communities. In Plan de Ayala and other corners of Mexico, women can\u2019t participate in local government. Men set priorities. They decide how to spend resources: repair the school or the park? Plan de Ayala\u2019s women aren\u2019t even registered residents, even though they are on voter rolls, so its 1,200 men can only guess at the true population. With no official data, it\u2019s unclear how many communities operate this way. But it\u2019s one of many contradictions for a part of the Mexican population that for centuries has been marginalized. Now, Indigenous women are pushing for change \u2014 little by little \u2014 with the younger generation often leading the charge. PATH TO ACTIVISM Of more than 23 million Indigenous people in Mexico \u2014 nearly 20% of the population \u2014 well over half live in poverty, according to government data from 2022. And women face the worst of it, with the lowest rates of literacy in their communities and little, if any, rights to own land. Neither of the two women candidates for president \u2014 Claudia Sheinbaum for the governing Morena party and the opposition\u2019s X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez \u2014 have spoken much about Indigenous issues. Still, women in this region can\u2019t hide some hope that a woman president could better address some of their most pressing needs: health care and education access, and protection from domestic violence. The status of Mexico\u2019s Indigenous peoples leaped onto the international stage in 1994 in Chiapas, when Zapatista guerrilla fighters declared war against the government. They aimed not to take power, but demanded that the government address racism and marginalization suffered by Indigenous peoples. The movement had unusually high participation from women. Twelve days of fighting and years of negotiation culminated in 2001 with a constitutional amendment that recognized the right of Indigenous people to autonomous government; to preserve their languages, land and cultural identity; and to have access to basic rights such as health care and education. This allowed many small Indigenous communities to govern themselves and choose their leaders without national political influence. It also meant that the federal government frequently looked the other way when those local customs contradicted basic rights like gender equality. After the uprising, Indigenous women felt encouraged to fight for their rights in their communities. In some places they succeeded. But poverty and inequality persist in many Indigenous communities. Juana Cruz, 51, is one of the women on a crusade to bring change. She grew up listening to stories of the abuses suffered by four generations of her family forced to work on an estate where they had to speak Spanish rather than their native Tojolabal, a Mayan-family language. She remembers being beaten in school for not speaking Spanish well. Today she is one of the most veteran social activists in Las Margaritas, the municipality that includes Plan de Ayala, and director of Tzome Ixuk, which means \u201corganized woman\u201d in Tojolabal. Her collective accompanies victims of domestic violence to report crimes, organizes talks to hear communities\u2019 needs, hosts workshops for men and women about gender rights, and teaches children Tojolabal. Political parties have approached her, she said, but she rejected their recruitment efforts \u2014 she wants to focus on organizing and educating in a politically independent environment. \u201cThe ability that we have to decide is because we are not (affiliated) with any authority,\u201d Cruz said. Six years ago, the Zapatistas and other Indigenous groups elected Mar\u00eda de Jesus Patricio, better known as Marichuy, to run for president as their first independent candidate. She faced intense racism and didn\u2019t make it onto the ballot. \u201cBut she gave us strength,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz\u2019s own activism stretches back to the Zapatista uprising, when she first heard about \u201corganizing\u201d for rights. In the mid-1990s, she demanded water, electricity, sewer and schools for an Indigenous neighborhood in Las Margaritas \u2014 demands that prompted dozens of men to attack her, she said. She described politicians finding her demands unacceptable \u2014 they believed Indigenous people didn\u2019t need such things. \u2018GENERATION OF CHANGE\u2019 Since Cruz and others made those basic demands, there\u2019s been progress in places like Las Margaritas, a sprawling township of some 140,000 people spread across about 400 mostly Indigenous communities, including Plan de Ayala. Some people here were born on hugemassive estates where Indigenous workers were treated like slaves. Today, many get by with money sent from relatives who\u2019ve made it to the United States. Unwritten rules still govern much of life in the villages. Mexican law prohibits marriage until age 18, but many teens leave home years earlier and live as couples until they can legally wed. The community considers them married. For some girls, it\u2019s the only way to escape abusive homes \u2014 one 15-year-old described to The Associated Press how a relative beat her almost daily. \u201cI wanted to get married as soon as I could,\u201d she said, even though she knew it meant giving up her dreams of continued education. \u201cI would love to study again, but I still can\u2019t because that\u2019s the way the rules are here.\u201d \u201cWhen you marry, you leave school, you leave everything that you have,\u201d said the girl, whose name AP is withholding because she\u2019s a victim of abuse. Increasingly, girls and young women are rejecting such norms. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s discussed in the workshops at Plan de Ayala high school. About a third of those gathered said they would like to continue studying, according to Mar\u00eda Leticia Santiz, 28, and Liz V\u00e1zquez, 33, who lead the discussion. \u201cYou all have the ability to make decisions in your communities, in your schools, in your families,\u201d V\u00e1zquez tells the group. \u201cYou are a generation of change.\u201d Santiz translates to Tojolabal. A buzz spreads through the group. Using the native language generates confidence and shows the youths they can be proud of it, Santiz said: \u201cThere are still young people, women who are ashamed of the language, of being Indigenous.\u201d V\u00e1zquez and Santiz are from a collective called Ch\u2019ieltik, which means \u201cwe are those who grow\u201d in the Indigenous language Tseltal. The group\u2019s goal is to encourage conversation and reflection among young people in some of Chiapas\u2019 most closed communities, learn the realities of people there, and provide tools to improve their lives. Santiz says that in Plan de Ayala, where women have never held positions of authority, some women do want to participate in local civic life. But \u201cthey don\u2019t dare because they feel they are going to be punished,\u201d Santiz said. \u201cThe social compacts that the people have sown in them are very ingrained.\u201d LOOKING AHEAD In Plan de Ayala, like most rural corners of Las Margaritas, there is little evidence of the coming national election. Posters of Sheinbaum are seen in some places. The face of G\u00e1lvez \u2014 who has Indigenous roots, with an Otomi father \u2014 is not. V\u00e1zquez says that personally, she has not connected with either candidate. But in the workshop, she tells the group that a woman becoming president proves nothing is impossible. Santiz is wary of politicians. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a change, attention toward the Indigenous,\u201d she said. She said she wishes politicians would be authentic in their outreach to Indigenous communities and not simply use their people to sell an inclusive image: \u201cBeing Indigenous isn\u2019t just coming from an Indigenous community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s returning and doing things for your community.\u201d Experts say politicians have long looked down on Indigenous people and have wrongly explained away chauvinistic behavior as the carrying on of ancestral practices. Examples of Indigenous women rising to power \u2014 for example, in leading the fight against controversial infrastructure projects like dams \u2014 have been minimized. The campaigns of the two leading female presidential candidates are notable for what\u2019s lacking: any prioritization of gender issues or detailed plans to address issues in Indigenous communities. Sheinbaum insists she will try to reach agreements to compensate for past injustices against some Indigenous peoples. G\u00e1lvez has only gone so far as to remind voters of projects she pushed when she was in charge of Indigenous development under a previous administration, two decades ago. In Plan de Ayala, V\u00e1zquez and Santiz leave the workshop at the high school encouraged. The young men seemed receptive to speaking about equality, and they see signs of change: fathers supporting their daughters\u2019 dreams, young women carving out spaces for themselves. After the workshop, Mada\u00ed G\u00f3mez, the 18-year-old, heads home to finish helping her mother. She\u2019s not yet sure about continuing school \u2014 she wants to be economically independent and considers herself a strong woman who doesn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Maybe she\u2019ll stay here and find work. Maybe she\u2019ll try making it to the U.S. That afternoon, she puts on her soccer uniform and heads to the local field, optimistic that more girls want to join. On the dirt track, teens pass older women wearing traditional embroidered blouses and shiny satin skirts returning from the fields, their bodies stooped by huge bundles of grass hoisted on their backs. G\u00f3mez said she believes in the potential of women in her community and thinks Mexico\u2019s first woman president could show they can do more even than men. \u201cI want gender equality to come, for them to give us that chance to raise our voices, for our voice to be valued the same as a man\u2019s,\u201d she said.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21leGljby1lbGVjdGlvbi1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLXdvbWVuLWFjdGl2aXNtLXNoZWluYmF1bS1nYWx2ZXotODExMmE5ZGEwYmYyZGRiNTY0ZjIwYmQ0NzhkYTRkNjLSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Mexico's next president is likely a woman.

(WSVN) - The Broward County Public School (BCPS) Board is set to swear in a new superintendent and discuss school closures on Wednesday morning. Dr. Howard Hepburn will be sworn in as the new Superintendent for BCPs, making him the sixth superintendent in the county in less than four years. The ceremony will take place at the Kathleen C. Wright Administration Center, located at 600 S.E. 3rd Ave., Fort Lauderdale. Dr. Hepburn\u2019s tenure with the district was short. He came from Palm Beach County, serving as Dr. Peter Licata\u2019s number two, but has more than two decades in education. Dr. Licata\u2019s resignation was unexpected last month, citing health reasons. Instead of allowing him to serve until the end of the year, the board decided to part ways with him as superintendent the same day he resigned, April 16. The transition comes amid the uncertainty about potential school closures in the district. Leaders are considering closing eight schools to combat dropping enrollment and save the district millions. Campuses would either close during the 2025-2026 school year or the following year. So far, no schools have been listed for closure. The goal is to provide months of community feedback and discussion before a decision on which school will be shut down. At the last school board meeting on May 21, the board unanimously approved the employment of Dr. Hepburn. The ceremony is set to begin at 8 a.m. with retired Broward County Judge Zebedee Wright expected to perform the swearing-in. Judge Zebedee is the husband of the late Kathleen C.

(WSVN) - The Broward County Public School (BCPS) Board swears in a new superintendent amid discussion of closures. Broward\u2019s latest superintendent, Dr. Howard Hepburn swore in Wednesday morning as the new Superintendent for BCPs, making him the sixth superintendent in the county in less than four years. The ceremony took place at the Kathleen C. Wright Administration Center, located at 600 S.E. 3rd Ave., Fort Lauderdale. Dr. Hepburn replaces Dr. Peter Licata\u2019s after unexpectedly resigned last month, citing health reasons. Dr. Hepburn\u2019s tenure with the district was short. He came from Palm Beach County, serving as Dr. Peter Licata\u2019s number two, with more than two decades in education \u201cI am elated, it feels really good to know that I am in a well oiled machine, a very talented district. We got a lot of talent in our building. We got a lot of challenges that we have to address. We have the staff that\u2019s more than capable to execute our plan,\u201d said Hepburn. For Hepburn, consistency is key. He says he is in it for the long haul, with plans to retire with the board and tackle the serious issues that are now under his reins. \u201cWell, I am here to stay. I am here for the long haul and hopefully Broward County doesn\u2019t have to look for another superintendent for a very long time. Consistency matters if we are trying to change the trajectory of our district,\u2019 said Hepburn. On Wednesday afternoon, Hepburn is expected to present a plan to shutter eight schools, either by the 2025-2026 school year or the following, with community input as the main focus. \u201cEvery community is different, every community has its own challenges and their own needs, so we want to out and talk to the community. Present those challenges to them and then have a conversation and start coming up with the best solutions that\u2019s going to provide the best learning opportunities for them,\u201d said Hepburn. It comes on the heels of community and a bit of board push back after district leaders planned to close Oakridge Elementary in Hollywood, Broward Estates Elementary in Lauderhill, and Olsen Middle School in Dania Beach. Now it\u2019s unclear which schools will be considered under the new plan, but it could save the district millions amid dropping enrollment across the school system. This revised plan proposal is set to begin at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

Xavi, who won 2-1 at Sevilla in his final match with the club, has agreed to give up the final year of his salary, which sources told ESPN was due to be around \u20ac12 million. However, he will be paid back a substantial part of the \u20ac2.5m he paid from his own pocket to secure his exit from his previous job with Al Sadd in 2021. The six members of his backroom staff will also be remunerated for the final year of their contracts at a cost of around \u20ac4m to Bar\u00e7a. Flick has been out of work since September 2023, when he was fired by the German national team following a group-stage exit at the 2022 World Cup and a run of poor results after the tournament. He had previously overseen great success at Bayern, winning the Champions League as part of a historic treble in 2020 before he took on the Germany job in the summer of 2021. Bar\u00e7a has had long-standing interest in the German coach; ESPN reported in 2021 that club president Joan Laporta had sounded out his availability while he was still in charge of Bayern. On that occasion, he had already committed to the Germany job, but Laporta has remained a fan and talks with Flick's camp have been constant since Xavi announced in January that he would step down. Flick's chances of landing the Bar\u00e7a job appeared to end last month when it was revealed Xavi would fulfil his contract, which was due to run until 2025, but events then took another turn. Remarks made by Xavi about the club's difficult financial position did not go down well with Laporta, and sources told ESPN that the Bar\u00e7a president was never quite convinced by the Catalan coach. That led to Xavi's dismissal last week, with the former Spain international saying on Saturday he \"respected and accepted the decision\" even if he would have preferred to leave \"in other circumstances.\" Xavi replaced Ronald Koeman at the end of 2021, steering the team from ninth in LaLiga to a second-placed finish in his first campaign in charge. He then led Bar\u00e7a to their first LaLiga title since 2019 in 2022-23, also winning the Spanish Supercopa, but a trophyless campaign this time around led the club to opt for a change of direction.", "summary": "Barcelona have announced the appointment of former Bayern Munich and Germany coach Hansi Flick as the club's new manager on a two-year contract.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40221741/barcelona-appoint-hansi-flick-manager-replace-xavi", "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2024/0526/r1337873_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:49:15", "author": "Moises Llorens,Sam Marsden", "authors": ["Moises Llorens", "Sam Marsden"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.216}, {"id": 225027502, "title": "Barcelona, Hansi Flick Agree to 2-Year Contract to Replace Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez as Manager", "text": "Barcelona found their new manager.

Barcelona fired Xavi last week. The former star midfielder led the club to a runner-up finish during La Liga's 2023-24 campaign. Barcelona won La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup under Xavi in 2022-23. They finished second in La Liga in 2021-22, Xavi's first season. The Spanish soccer power signed Flick to a contract through June 2026. The 59-year-old started his coaching career in 1996 at FC Victoria Bammental. He then managed TSG Hoffenheim from 2000 to 2005. Flick coached German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich from 2019 to 2021. He also managed the German national team from 2021 to 2023. Flick was an assistant for Germany when they won the 2014 World Cup. He led Bayern Munich to a Champions League crown in 2019. German forward Robert Lewandowski, who now plays at Barcelona, scored a tournament-best 15 goals during that run. Flick, known for his philosophy of ball possession and attacking, led Bayern Munich to two Bundesliga titles. He also won a German Cup, German Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup at Bayern. In 2020, they joined Barcelona as the only European club to win all six competitions they participated in during a singular calendar year. Barcelona accomplished that feat in 2009, when their roster featured Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Thierry Henry, among other soccer legends. \"My hunger is really big for titles,\" Flick said. \"I would like to stay on this path with Barcelona. I think we can achieve a lot together.\" Barcelona is scheduled to face Manchester City of England's Premier League in a friendly June 30 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. They also have scheduled matches against La Liga rival Real Madrid and Spanish Serie A foe Inter Milan as part of a U.S. summer tour. \"Barcelona is one of the best academies in the world,\" Flick said. \"They have a mix between experienced players and also young talented players.

They are unlikely to go to a doctor unless they become very ill. Strater said about 150,000 people work in U.S. dairies. She said many worker advocates believe the virus has spread to more people than tests are showing. \u201cThe method being used to surveil at-risk workers has been very passive,\u201d she said. Federal officials told reporters May 22 that just 40 people connected to U.S. dairy farms had been tested for the virus, although others are being \u201cactively monitored\u201d for symptoms. Federal authorities recently announced they would pay farmworkers $75 each to be tested for the virus as part of a new program that also offers incentives for farm owners to allow testing of their dairy herds. Officials of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they recognize the importance of gaining cooperation and trust from front-line dairy employees. CDC spokesperson Rosa Norman said in an email that the incentive payment compensates workers for their time contributing to the monitoring of how many people are infected, how sick they become and whether humans are spreading the virus to each other. She noted the CDC believes the virus currently poses a low risk to public health. But Strater is skeptical of the incentive for farmworkers to be checked for the virus. If a worker tests positive, they\u2019d likely be instructed to go to a clinic then stay home from work. She said they couldn\u2019t afford to do either. \u201cThat starts to sound like a really bad deal for 75 bucks because at the end of the week, they\u2019re supposed to feed their families,\u201d she said. Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas, said that in her state, health officials would provide short-term medical care, such as giving farmworkers the flu treatment Tamiflu. Those arrangements wouldn\u2019t necessarily cover hospitalization if it were needed, she said. She said the workers\u2019 bigger concern appears to be that they would have to stay home from work or might even lose their jobs if they tested positive. Many farmworkers are from other countries and they often labor in grueling conditions for little pay. They may fear attention to cases among them will inflame anti-immigrant fervor, said Monica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Societies have a long history of blaming marginalized communities for the spread of contagious diseases. Latino immigrants were verbally attacked during the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic in 2009, for example and some media personalities used the outbreak to push for a crackdown on immigration. Bethany Boggess Alcauter, director of research and public health programs at the National Center for Farmworker Health, said many workers on dairy farms have been told very little about this new disease spreading in the cows they handle. \u201cEducation needs to be a part of testing efforts, with time for workers to ask questions,\u201d she said. These conversations should be conducted in the farmworkers\u2019 language, with people they are likely to trust, she said. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said public health officials must make clear that workers\u2019 immigration status will not be reported as part of the investigation into the new flu virus. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be the police,\u201d he said. Dawn O\u2019Connell, an administrator at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press conference May 22 that nearly 5 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1, the bird flu virus circulating in cattle, are being prepared, but that officials have not decided whether the shots will be offered to farmworkers when they\u2019re ready later this year. The CDC asked states in early May to share personal protective equipment with farm owners, to help them shield workers from the bird flu virus. State health departments in California, Texas and Wisconsin, which have large dairy industries, all said they have offered to distribute such equipment. Chris Van Deusen, a Texas health department spokesperson, said four dairy farms had requested protective equipment from the state stockpile. He said other farms may already have had what they needed. Spokespeople for the California and Wisconsin health departments said they did not immediately receive requests from farm owners for the extra equipment. Strater, the United Farm Workers official, said protective equipment offerings need to be practical. Most dairy workers already wear waterproof aprons, boots, and gloves, she said. It wouldn\u2019t be realistic to expect them to also wear N95 face masks in the wet, hot conditions of a milking operation, she said. Plastic face shields seem like a better option for that environment, especially to prevent milk from spraying into workers\u2019 eyes, where it could cause infection, she said. Other types of agricultural workers, including those who work with chickens, also face potential infection. But scientists say the version of the virus spreading in cows could be particularly dangerous, because it has adapted to live in mammals. Strater said she\u2019s most worried about dairy workers, who spend 10 to 12 hours a day in enclosed spaces with cows. \u201cTheir faces are approximately 5 inches away from the milk and the udders all day long,\u201d she said. \u201cThe intimacy of it, where their face is so very close to the infectious material, is different.\u201d KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Federal investigators have contacted Combs\u2019 accusers, interviewed them and notified them that they could be brought in to testify in front of a federal grand jury in New York City, sources told the outlet. However, witness preparations have not yet begun as the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agency is still in the process of gathering evidence in their federal investigation of Combs, sources added to CNN. One of the sources said that the HSI are making sure their investigation is thorough to ensure that any potential indictment brought forward against Combs is \u201cbulletproof.\u201d The HSI and Combs\u2019 representatives did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. The HSI told CNN in a statement that the investigation is ongoing. At least six people have filed lawsuits claiming that Combs sexually assaulted or harassed them since November \u2014 with the latest lawsuit being filed on May 23. In some of the lawsuits sex trafficking allegations were also brought forward, along with allegations of the rapper drugging individuals against their will.

One source that was familiar with the investigation told CNN that it was \u201cmuch bigger than just these lawsuits,\u201d and that some accusers have been interviewed multiple times. Additionally, the sources claim new witnesses have also been brought in for questioning. Federal investigators previously raided the musician\u2019s properties in Los Angeles and Miami on March 25 as part of their probe into Combs. A source told CNN that agents are in possession of videos possibly obtained during the raid and are currently \u201ccontacting people that they\u2019ve found on the tapes.\u201d One person who has been questioned after featuring in one of the tapes is a male sex worker who lobbied allegations against the \u201cVictory\u201d rapper, a source told CNN. However, the source did not give any additional information on what may have been discussed. Combs has denied all allegations, saying in a statement obtained by PEOPLE in December: \u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH. For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy.\u201d \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth,\u201d he added.

She is not new to New Haven. She has served as a Yale trustee since 2022 and received her master\u2019s degree and doctorate at Yale, where she studied art history. Her scholarship has focused on the politics of art and slavery in the southern United States in the 1800s, Yale said. \u201cI look forward to many things when I begin my service,\u201d McInnis said in a statement. \u201cAt the top of the list is to reconnect with those I know and to meet so many more of you. You make this university what it is.\u201d She added, \u201cOur faculty members are not only international leaders in their own fields but also drive innovation in other academic disciplines and progress in other sectors. Our talented staff advance every aspect of our university and bring excellence to all they do. Similarly, our students excel in their studies, while also making Yale a richer community through their art making, advocacy, and deep engagement with the local community.\u201d McInnis said she plans to schedule listening sessions and individual meetings later in the summer. She will take over leadership of an elite school founded in 1701 that now has a $40 billion endowment, about 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students, 5,500 faculty members and about 11,600 staff. Yale and Stony Brook were among schools nationwide that saw protests over the Israel-Hamas war, and students at both campuses were arrested. McInnis did not mention Gaza in her comments. At Stony Brook, McInnis said that while the school supported students\u2019 rights of free expression and peaceful assembly, \u201cprotests and demonstrations will not be allowed to disrupt the academic environment, create safety issues, or violate university guidelines regarding time, place and manner.\u201d Earlier this month, a proposed censure of McInnis over the arrests of 29 protesters at Stony Brook was narrowly rejected by the school\u2019s faculty Senate. In a statement, Yale\u2019s search committee praised McInnis for her academic leadership experience and scholarship. \u201cWhat excites me about President-elect McInnis is that she comes to the job as a practicing humanist in all dimensions,\u201d said Jacqueline Goldsby, a professor of African American studies, English and American studies at Yale. \u201cHer books on antebellum visual culture are award-winning and represent the incisive, rigorous scholarship Yale faculty produce and that we want our students to study.\u201d The committee also lauded McInnis for her work on climate change. She is the first board chair of the New York Climate Exchange and led the founding of an international climate change solutions center in New York City, Yale said.

Two of the 12 jurors now deliberating Trump's fate are attorneys, which is unusual for a criminal case. During an MSNBC appearance, jury consultant and former prosecutor Paul Callan weighed in on the effect that those attorneys could have on deliberations. Callan told MSNBC hosts Ana Cabrera and Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart, \"Prosecutors, for the most part, don't want lawyers on their juries. And the reason they don't want lawyers on their juries is they think that lawyers engage in hyper-analysis \u2014 that they're always looking for a technical thing that could maybe eliminate the reasonable doubt.\" READ MORE: 'Biggest felony in American history': Prosecutor's closing argument against Trump praised The jury consultant continued, \"It's surprising that there were two lawyers who were left on this case. But I have a close friend, a lawyer who served on a jury, and he said to me \u2014 this is the surprising thing that he found in the jury deliberations \u2014 (that) he got shunned by the other jurors. Because they said, 'Well, the lawyers just look for a technicality for somebody to get off. We want to know whether he committed the crime or not.' And he ended up slipping a note to a nurse who was a good friend of his on the jury \u2014 became a friend of his on the jury \u2014 and she would express his point about how technically, the reasonable doubt was present in the case. But that could happen in this case too.\" Callan went on to argue that during deliberations, the non-lawyer jurors may either \"shun\" the two attorneys or look to them for guidance. Callan told Cabrera and D\u00edaz-Balart, \"Everybody is saying, 'Well, they could be leaders in the deliberation.' They could be shunned by the jurors, who might say, 'No, we don't have to listen to the lawyers'\u2026. And by the way, every group of 12 jurors \u2014 they're always different.\" Callan added, \"You know, lawyers \u2014 a lot of us\u2014 we like to go and talk to the jury.
