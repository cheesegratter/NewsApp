The administration promptly did just that, asking the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to block Breyer's order from taking effect.\n\nTrump, over the past week, had federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard, and mobilized another approximately 700 U.S. Marines, to respond to protests in Los Angeles against federal immigration enforcement actions. \n\nNewsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's federalization of the Guard without the consent of the governor.\n\nBreyer's order came hours after a hearing held in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where he sharply questioned lawyers for the federal government on Trump rationale and authority for the highly unusual actions. \n\n\"At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the President followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions. He did not,\" Breyer wrote in his order.\n\n\"His actions were illegal \u2014 both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith,\" the judge wrote.\n\nBreyer in his order said that none of the three conditions required for Trump's federalization of the Guard under a certain federal statute existed, namely the U.S. having been invaded or in danger of being invaded; a \"rebellion\" against the federal government; or the president being unable to execute U.S. laws.\n\n\"The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of 'rebellion,' \" Breyer wrote.\n\nNewsom praised the order, and his office also tweeted a video showing the \"Death Star,\" built by the evil Empire in the \"Star Wars\" movie series, exploding in space after it was attacked by forces of the Rebel Alliance.\n\n\"The court just confirmed what we all know \u2014 the military belongs on the battlefield, not on our city streets,\" Newsom said in a post on X.\n\n\"This win is not just for California, but the nation,\" Newsom wrote. \"It's a check on a man whose authoritarian tendencies are increasing by the day.

Rodriguez | Associated Press\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Thursday directing President Donald Trump to return control of the National Guard to California.\n\nThe order, which takes effect at noon Friday, said the deployment of the Guard was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the ruling, but the federal government immediately filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit court.\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump overstepped his bounds in ordering the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how that would change the situation on the ground.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to block the Guard\u2019s deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids.\n\nHe argued that the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and wanted the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying that involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.\n\nThe Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\u201d in its official response Wednesday.\n\nIn a broad ruling, the judge determined Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place.\n\nMaj. Gen. Scott Sherman, speaking in an interview with The Associated Press and one other media outlet, said that as of Wednesday about 500 of the Guard troops have been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials.\n\nSherman is the commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles.\n\nTypically, the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.\n\nThe lawsuit argued that Title 10 requires, among other things, that the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard.\n\nBrett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not.\n\nIn a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump\u2019s orders were not subject to judicial review.\n\n\u201cCourts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation. Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. And courts should not interfere here either,\u201d the department said.\n\n\u201cOur position is this is not subject to judicial review,\u201d Shumate told the judge.\n\nBreyer, who at one point waved a copy of the Constitution, said he disagreed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority. That\u2019s the difference between a constitutional government and King George,\u201d he said.\n\nThe protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.\n\nFederal immigration agents have been arresting people at Home Depot parking lots and other businesses, sparking fear in immigrant communities, after the Trump administration said it wanted to dramatically increase arrests under its immigration crackdown.\n\nTrump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.\nThe Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles, and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters.\n\nDozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand the raids stop and the troops leave.", "summary": "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump overstepped his bounds in ordering the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/12/judge-says-trump-illegally-deployed-national-guard-to-help-with-la-protests-must-return-control/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25162803255280.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 01:59:44", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.315}, {"id": 330875696, "title": "Federal judge orders Trump to return control of California National Guard to Newsom", "text": "A federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump acted illegally when he seized control of California\u2019s National Guard during ICE-related riots in Los Angeles.

Each night since the curfew was put in place in the sanctuary city by Mayor Karen Bass, the LAPD have been arresting protesters and others who remain in the area.\n\nBefore the Appeals Court ruling flipped the script on Newsom, the Governor was having media victory dance at longtime foil Trump\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cToday was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,\u201d he said in a short press conference Thursday evening when it looked like he was back in charge of the Guard.\n\nNot for the first time, Newsom took aim at Trump\u2019s claims that L.A. was going to erupt in rioting and chaos if he hadn\u2019t taken over the Guard and called them up as ICE protection. \u201cThis is what Donald Trump does,\u201d the two-term Democrat and potential 2028 White House contender added. \u201cHe creates a problem \u2014 and then he tries to be a hero in his own Marvel movie. I would call it pathetic if it wasn\u2019t so dangerous.\u201d\n\nPREVIOUSLY, 6:14 PM: Donald Trump has just been ordered by a federal judge to \u201creturn control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.\u201d Forthwith meaning in practical terms means noon PT Friday with even more orders from the bench to possible follow.\n\nIn an order handed down Thursday just a couple of hours after a pitched hearing in San Francisco between Department of Justice lawyers and Golden State attorneys, Judge Charles Breyer awarded Gavin Newsom the temporary restraining order he sought over Trump\u2019s federalization of the California National Guard on June 7 after protests over ICE raids of undocumented immigrants in and around L.A.\n\n\u201cAt this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the President followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions,\u201d the judge wrote in a 36-page order this evening. \u201cHe did not.\u201d The Bill Clinton appointed judge added: \u201cHis actions were illegal \u2014 both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nNoting the standard required for such a big reach by the Executive Branch and the reality of the mainly passionate but peaceful protests over ICE in LA, the judge said the gatherings around federal buildings and immigration enforcement \u201cin Los Angeles fall far short of rebellion.\u201d\n\nRead The Judge\u2019s Order For Trump To Return Control Of The National Guard To Newsom Here\n\nNewsom and the state Attorney General first filed suit against Trump, Defense Sec. Pete Hegseth and others in the administration on June 9. The gist of their argument was that the president overstepped his authority when he dispatched National Guard troops to the region to respond to protests of ICE immigration raids late last week by heavily armed masked agents. The governor said the president violated the law by not consulting with him first before the deployment.\n\nOn June 11, Newsom upped the ante and demanded a TRO to halt \u201congoing and unnecessary militarization of Los Angeles\u201d and Trump\u2019s brazen authoritarian tactics ASAP. Trump\u2019s DOJ lawyers pushed to have the 1 p.m. PT deadline set by the governor delayed, and Judge Breyer (brother of Clinton appointed Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who retired in 2022) agreed. He required more briefings from both sides and set a hearing on the matter for today at 1:30 p.m. PT.\n\nA hearing in which federal lawyers often seemed not to know their own argument or the facts to back it up.\n\nHaving already warned on \u201ca monarchy\u201d in the hearing earlier today, Breyer worried in his order this evening that \u201cDefendants\u2019 actions also threaten to chill legitimate First Amendment expression.\u201d To that, and with the overriding Constitutional and jurisdictional issues at play, he laid out exactly what\u2019s next for Newsom and Trump with this halting of military deployment to America\u2019s second-largest city:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order:Defendants are temporarily ENJOINED from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles.Defendants are DIRECTED to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Newsom. The Court further STAYS this order until noon on June 13, 2025.Plaintiffs are ORDERED to post a nominal bond of $100 within 24 hours. The bond shall be filed in the Clerk\u2019s Office and be deposited into the registry of the Court. If said bond is not posted by the aforementioned date and time, this Order shall be dissolved.Defendants are further ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE why a preliminary injunction should not issue. A hearing on this order to show cause will be held on June 20, 2025 at 10 a.m. Plaintiffs\u2019 moving papers shall be filed no later than June 16, 2025; Defendants\u2019 opposition shall be due no later than June 18, 2025, and Plaintiffs\u2019 reply shall be due on June 19, 2025.\n\nWhether or not this White House complies with Breyer\u2019s order is another matter. For one thing, almost immediately after Judge Breyer\u2019s order hit the docket, Trump\u2019s DOJ filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit court.\n\nEarlier today, after the hearing before Judge Breyer ended and before his order was made public, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to take more factually inaccurate potshots at Newsom or Newscum as he says:\n\nLess than two hours before today\u2019s hearing, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appeared to be backing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s avoidance of a congressional hearing in Washington, DC earlier in the day of whether or not the administration would respect court orders over its use of troops in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe are not going away,\u201d Noem said at the same L.A. press conference where federal agents shockingly assaulted Sen. Alex Padilla, handcuffed and dragged him away for trying to ask the DHS chief a question. \u201cWe are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city,\u201d Noem added with a reference to California and L.A.\u2019s \u201csanctuary\u201d policies that prevent state and civic participation in federal immigration raids and detentions.\n\nAlso, Thursday LA Mayor Karen Bass gave much more heated remarks than is usual for the circumspect politician in talking about the continued ICE rounding up of residents and the 4,000 Guard troops and 700 Marines on the streets in and around federal buildings and more. \u201cNo matter what happens out of the White House,\u201d the much Trump attacked Bass said today, as DTLA went under another night of dusk-to-dawn curfew. \u201cWe will always uphold and reflect what Los Angeles and the United States are truly about: freedom, tolerance and, for God\u2019s sake, our Constitution.\u201d\n\nAlmost as fast on the social media draw as Trump, Newsom went online soon after the order landed on the federal court docket. \u201cThe court just confirmed what we all know \u2014 the military belongs on the battlefield, not on our city streets,\u201d the Governor posted with a copy of the order. \u201cThis win is not just for California, but the nation,\u201d he said in his post. \u201cIt\u2019s a check on a man whose authoritarian tendencies are increasing by the day. End the illegal militarization of Los Angeles now, @realDonaldTrump History is watching.\u201d\n\nNewsom later went before the cameras and said of Trump, among other things, \u201cToday\u2019s order makes clear that he is not above or beyond constitutional restraints.\u201d\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

Gavin Newsom control over National Guard troops the president deployed to Los Angeles to assist in immigration enforcement and controlling unrest, a federal judge said in a temporary restraining order Thursday.\n\nThe order, which takes effect at noon Friday, said the deployment of the Guard was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the ruling, but the federal government immediately filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit court.\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump overstepped his bounds in ordering the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests erupted over the immigration crackdown.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how that would change the situation on the ground.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to block the Guard\u2019s deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids.\n\nHe argued that the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and wanted the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying that involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.\n\nThe Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\u201d in its official response Wednesday.\n\nIn a broad ruling, the judge determined Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place.\n\nMaj. Gen. Scott Sherman, speaking in an interview with The Associated Press and one other media outlet, said that as of Wednesday about 500 of the Guard troops have been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials.\n\nSherman is commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles. The ruling does not apply to the Marines.\n\nTypically the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.\n\nTitle 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service under certain limited circumstances, such as when the country \u201cis invaded,\u201d when \u201cthere is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,\u201d or when the president is unable \u201cto execute the laws of the United States.\u201d\n\nBreyer said in his ruling that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.\n\n\u201cThe protests in Los Angeles fall far short of \u2018rebellion,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit argued that Title 10 also requires that the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard.\n\nBrett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not.\n\nIn a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump\u2019s orders were not subject to judicial review.\n\n\u201cCourts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation. Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. And courts should not interfere here either,\u201d the department said.\n\n\u201cOur position is this is not subject to judicial review,\u201d Shumate told the judge.\n\nBreyer, who at one point waved a copy of the constitution, said he disagreed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority. That\u2019s the difference between a constitutional government and King George,\u201d he said.\n\nThe protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.\n\nFederal immigration agents have been arresting people at Home Depot parking lots and other businesses, sparking fear in immigrant communities, after the Trump administration said it wanted to dramatically increase arrests under its immigration crackdown.\n\nTrump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.\n\nThe Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles, and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters.\n\nDozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand the raids stop and the troops leave.", "summary": "The order, which takes effect at noon Friday, said the deployment of the Guard was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority.\n\n\nThe post Judge says Trump illegally deployed National Guard to help with LA protests, must return control appeared first on Boston.com.", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/06/12/judge-says-trump-illegally-deployed-national-guard-to-help-with-la-protests-must-return-control/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Immigration_Raids_Los_Angeles_55280-684a538fc207c-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 01:32:50", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.282}, {"id": 330965024, "title": "Judge orders National Guard authority transferred back to Cali [News]", "text": "Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up \u00bb\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

On Thursday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that Trump\u2019s deployment of the California National Guard was unlawful and ordered the control of the National Guard to return to Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued to restrict its activity. During the Thursday hearing, Judge Breyer reportedly seemed skeptical of the Justice Department\u2019s argument that courts could not question the president\u2019s judgment on key legal issues, including whether the protests and unrest in Los Angeles constituted \u201ca rebellion or danger of a rebellion\u201d in an attempt to argue that the military mobilization is legal under Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Forces, which gives the president the authority to federalize the National Guard if there is \u201ca rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the president exercising his authority, and of course, the president is limited in his authority,\u201d Judge Breyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between the president and King George.\u201d In a 36-page sharply worded decision, Breyer declared the actions not only unlawful but a direct violation of the Tenth Amendment, writing that \u201cit is not the federal government\u2019s place in our constitutional system to take over a state\u2019s police power whenever it is dissatisfied with how vigorously or quickly the state is enforcing its own laws.\u201d Breyer also toppled Trump\u2019s claim of a \u201crebellion in L.A.\u201d to use the federal provision to activate state troops over the anti-immigration protests, writing that \u201cthe protests in Los Angeles fall far short of \u2018rebellion.\u201d \u201cViolence is necessary for a rebellion, but it is not sufficient,\u201d Breyer wrote. \u201cEven accepting the questionable premise that people armed with fireworks, rocks, mangoes, concrete, chairs, or bottles of liquid are \u2018armed\u2019 in a 1903 sense \u2013 the Court is aware of no evidence in the record of actual firearms \u2013 there is little evidence of whether the violent protesters\u2019 actions were \u2018open or avowed.\u2019\u201d In a scathing blow, the Judge also addressed Trump\u2019s claims that the protests were an attempted insurrection, as seen on January 6th with his previous administration, noting that there\u2019s no evidence to support the claim. Source: Anadolu / Getty \u201cNor is there evidence that any of the violent protesters were attempting to overthrow the government as a whole,\u201d Breyer wrote. \u201cThe evidence is overwhelming that protesters gathered to protest a single issue \u2013 the immigration raids.\u201d Following the decision, the Trump Administration filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit, which ruled to allow Trump to maintain his deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles amid protests over stepped-up immigration enforcement, temporarily pausing the lower court\u2019s ruling to block the mobilization. The court\u2019s decision does not give Trump the green light from the judicial system to continue his militarized attack on citizens, but it did give him the ability to temporarily maintain control of the National Guard. Despite the minor setback, the outcome of Newsom\u2019s lawsuit strikes a critical blow against the Trump Administration\u2019s continued attempt at executive overreach, especially when it comes at the expense of our constitutional rights and guaranteed freedoms. \u201cToday was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \u201cDonald Trump has tested the limits of that, and has done so consistently, but today\u2019s order makes clear that he is not above or beyond constitutional constraints. While Trump attempted to gaslight the American people into believing that federal troops were needed to \u201cprevent Los Angeles from being obliterated,\u201d the facts tell another story. One that shows that peaceful protests were being met with an increasingly violent response, not just from troops, but from local police as well. A now-viral video of LAPD officers on horseback clubbing unarmed demonstrators for simply walking down the street painted a chilling picture of what\u2019s at stake: not just the right to protest, but the freedom to exist in public space without being assaulted by the very people sworn to protect us. This isn\u2019t just about Trump\u2019s misuse of the military; it\u2019s about the intentional erosion of state sovereignty and our civil liberties under the guise of \u201claw and order\u201d by an administration run by a felon. Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which the Trump Administration attempted to use to wreak havo,c also requires that orders from the president \u201cbe issued through the governors of the States\u201d, which did not happen for California. Source: David McNew / Getty According to the lawsuit, on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent a memo to the head of the California Guard to mobilize nearly 2,000 members, who then sent the memo to Newsom\u2019s office, resulting in neither Newsom nor his office consenting to the mobilization. Newsom wrote a letter to Hegseth on Sunday, asking him to rescind the troop deployment, stating that the mobilization was \u201ca serious breach of state sovereignty that seems intentionally designed to inflame the situation, while simultaneously depriving the state of deploying these personnel and resources where they are truly required.\u201d Judge Breyer wrote in his decision that Trump had not satisfied any of the requirements that must be met in order to call up members of a state\u2019s National Guard and that the president had not complied with a procedural aspect of federal law that requires presidents to issue an order \u201cthrough the governor\u201d when they want to federalize state troops. \u201cRegardless of whether Defendants gave Governor Newsom an opportunity to consult with them or consent to the federalization of California\u2019s National Guard, they did not issue their orders through him, and thus failed to comply with federal law\u201d, Breyer wrote. The panel of three judges from the 9th Circuit \u2013 two Trump appointees and an appointee of former President Joe Biden \u2013 said it will hold a hearing Tuesday on the issue. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate. LAPD has reported over 200 arrests in recent days, most for violations as minor as curfew or \u201cunlawful assembly.\u201d But that\u2019s not stopping Trump from continuing to frame these demonstrations as violent uprisings, conveniently omitting that most violence has come from law enforcement, not the demonstrators. Adding more fuel to the attempted chaos, Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a news conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who vowed to press ahead with the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, despite the unrest, the rulings, or the public outcry. This is where we are, America. Peaceful protestors getting trampled by horses; federal troops deployed without consent; elected officials ejected for asking questions; and a president who treats constitutional law like an optional suggestion. But Thursday\u2019s ruling is a reminder that good trouble still matters. That courts can still uphold the rule of law.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address on YouTube that the attacks will continue \u201cfor as many days at it takes to remove this threat.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took \u201cunilateral action against Iran\u201d and that Israel advised the U.S. that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense. \u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,\u201d Rubio said in a statement released by the White House. Rubio also issued a warning to Iran that it should not target U.S. interests or personnel. People in Tehran awoke to the sound of the blast. State television acknowledged the blast. It wasn't immediately clear what had been hit, though smoke could be rising from Chitgar, a neighborhood in western Tehran. There are no known nuclear sites in that area \u2014 but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was happening in the rest of the country. An Israeli military official says that his country targeted Iranian nuclear sites, without identifying them. The official spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing operation, which is also targeting military sites. Benchmark Brent crude spiked on the attack, rising nearly 5% on the news. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said that his country carried out the attack, without saying what it targeted. \u201cIn the wake of the state of Israel\u2019s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,\" he said in a statement.

It appeared to be the most significant attack Iran has faced since its 1980s war with Iraq.\n\nThe strikes came amid simmering tensions over Iran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program and appeared certain to trigger a reprisal, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning that \u201csevere punishment\u201d would be directed at Israel. Israel said Iran had launched drones in an initial response.\n\nMultiple sites around the country were hit, including Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air.\n\nThe leader of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, was confirmed dead, Iranian state television reported, a development that is a significant blow to Tehran\u2019s governing theocracy and an immediate escalation of its long-simmering conflict with Israel.\n\nThe chief of staff of Iranian armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, was also confirmed dead by Iranian state television. Other top military officials and scientists were believed to have been killed.\n\nIn Washington, the Trump administration, which had cautioned Israel against an attack during continued negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program, said that it had not been involved and warned against any retaliation targeting U.S. interests or personnel.\n\nStill, it seemed likely the U.S. suspected an attack could be in the offing, with Washington on Wednesday pulling some American diplomats from Iraq\u2019s capital and offering voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East.\n\nIsrael calls attacks preemptive strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\n\nIsraeli leaders cast the preemptive assault as a fight for the nation\u2019s survival that was necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, though it remains unclear how close the country is to achieving that or whether Iran had actually been planning a strike soon.\n\n\u201cIt could be a year. It could be within a few months,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he vowed to pursue the attack for as long as necessary to \u201cremove this threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a clear and present danger to Israel\u2019s very survival,\u201d he said.\n\nSome 200 Israeli aircraft took part in the opertion, hitting about 100 targets, Israeli army chief spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said, adding that the attacks were ongoing.\n\nIn the aftermath, Defrin said Iran had launched more than 100 drones toward Israel and that \u201call the defense systems are acting to intercept the threats.\u201d\n\nIsrael, Iraq, Iran and Jordan shut down their airspace to all flights as a precaution.\n\nIran confirms top officials and scientists killed.\n\nKhamenei issued a statement carried by the state-run IRNA news agency. It confirmed that top military officials and scientists had been killed in the attack.\n\nIsrael \u201copened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,\u201d Khamenei said.\n\nFor Netanyahu, the operation distracts attention from Israel\u2019s ongoing and increasingly unpopular war in Gaza, which is now over 20 months old. There is a broad consensus in the Israeli public that Iran is a major threat, and Israel\u2019s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, a staunch critic of Netanyahu, offered his \u201cfull support\u201d for the mission against Iran. But if Iranian reprisals cause heavy Israeli casualties or major disruptions to daily life, Netanyahu could see public opinion quickly shift.\n\nMultiple sites in the Iranian capital were hit in the attack, which Netanyahu said targeted both nuclear and military sites. Also targeted were officials leading Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that an Israeli strike hit Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and said it was closely monitoring radiation levels.\n\nThe strike on Iran pushed the Israeli military to its limits, requiring the use of aging air-to-air refuelers to get its fighter jets close enough to attack. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Israeli jets entered Iranian airspace or just fired so-called \u201cstandoff missiles\u201d over another country. People in Iraq heard fighter jets overhead at the time of the attack. Israel previously attacked Iran from over the border in Iraq.\n\nTension had been growing for weeks ahead of attacks\n\nThe potential for an attack had been apparent for weeks as angst built over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said that he did not believe an attack was imminent but also acknowledged that it \u201ccould very well happen.\u201d Once the attacks were underway, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem issued an alert telling American government workers and their families to shelter in place until further notice.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took \u201cunilateral action against Iran\u201d and that Israel advised the U.S. that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense.\n\n\u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,\u201d Rubio said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nTrump is scheduled to attend a meeting of his National Security Council on Friday in the White House Situation Room, where he is expected to discuss the conflict with top advisers. It is not clear if he plans to make public remarks on the strikes.\n\nIsrael has long been determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a concern laid bare on Thursday when the Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years censured Iran over its refusal to work with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more-advanced ones.\n\nEven so, there are multiple assessments on how many nuclear weapons it could conceivably build, should it choose to do so. Iran would need months to assemble, test and field any weapon, which it so far has said it has no desire to do. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess Iran does not have a weapons program at this time.\n\nIn a sign of the far-reaching implications of the emerging conflict, Israel\u2019s main airport was closed and benchmark Brent crude spiked on news of the attack, rising nearly 8%. Both Iran and Israel closed their airspace.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that in the aftermath of the strikes, \u201cmissile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAs the explosions in Tehran started, Trump was on the lawn of the White House mingling with members of Congress. It was unclear if he had been informed, but the president continued shaking hands and posing for pictures for several minutes.\n\nTrump earlier said he urged Netanyahu to hold off on any action while the administration negotiated with Iran over nuclear enrichment.\n\n\u201cAs long as I think there is a (chance for an) agreement, I don\u2019t want them going in because I think it would blow it,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nFederman reported from Jerusalem.

Saudi Arabia\u2019s Palestinian peace conference, conveniently scheduled next week in Paris, will double as a polite but firm rebuke of Israeli actions, reaffirming Palestine\u2019s statehood as a prerequisite for closer relations.\n\nThe UAE and Bahrain \u2014 which normalized ties with Israel through the 2020 Abraham Accords \u2014 are signaling quietly to Tel Aviv: \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, but please don\u2019t drag us in deeper.\u201d With Iranian missiles easily capable of reaching Abu Dhabi skyscrapers, their hesitation is understandable.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington finds itself diplomatically lonelier than ever, as Russia and China profit from the unfolding chaos.\n\nMore: This crucial corner of the energy market is at high risk from an all-out war between Israel and Iran \u2014 and it\u2019s not oil\n\nThree scenarios investors should understand \u2014 all of them costly\n\n Chronic volatility, elevated energy prices and persistent geopolitical stress are now baseline conditions for markets and your money.\n\nMarkets now face three distinct, costly scenarios:\n\nBase case (60%): Tensions remain high but limited.

Oil soars past $120, stocks fall 10%\u201315%, defensive assets and other perceived safe-haven holdings jump.\n\nDiplomatic miracle (15%): Optimistic but improbable. Peace unexpectedly breaks out, markets rally sharply \u2014 then quickly sober up as geopolitical realities resurface.\n\nWatch these panic indicators carefully:\n\nOil rises above $90: Indicates imminent supply disruptions.USD/JPY above 155: Safe-haven stampede intensifying.Credit spreads above 150 bps: Corporate stress increasing sharply.VIX above 30: Market volatility signals widespread panic.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attack marks a fundamental shift. Traditional deterrence and predictable geopolitics no longer apply. Israel chose to act now because waiting wasn\u2019t strategic patience \u2014 it was strategic surrender.\n\nThis new Middle East means that chronic volatility, elevated energy prices and persistent geopolitical stress are now baseline conditions for markets and your money.\n\nInvestors must diversify aggressively, hedge thoughtfully and abandon any visions of easy diplomatic solutions.

Markets: Wall Street moved lower Friday afternoon as tensions in the Middle East escalate following Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure. Iranian state TV said that it has suspended nuclear weapons negotiations with the U.S. \u2014 the two sides had been set to talk on Sunday. Not long afterward, as headlines around Iranian missile attacks in Israel surfaced, losses in the stock market picked up steam. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 2%, leading to the downside, while both the S & P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 1%. Meanwhile, oil prices spiked on the news, though the gains have moderated compared with where they were in overnight trading. Brent crude, the international benchmark, surged 7% to above $74 a barrel. U.S. oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude also popped 7%, trading close to $73 a barrel. As Investing Club Portfolio Analyst Zev Fima wrote earlier this afternoon , our approach right now is to sit on our hands and not make any dramatic moves to the portfolio. \"So as we approach what could be a weekend packed full of fear-inducing geopolitical headlines, we have to do that most difficult of things: nothing,\" he wrote. Medical shuffle: Club name Amazon is reorganizing its health-care business into six new units \"with the goal of creating a simpler structure,\" our CNBC colleagues Annie Palmer and Ashley Capoot reported Friday. Here are a few excerpts from their story, though we recommend reading it in full : \"Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively,\" [Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services] said in a video chat. \"One of the problems we're trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that's common in healthcare.\" .... Amazon declined to share financial figures for its health business, but Lindsay said it is seeing \"very strong growth\" across the offerings. As long-term investors in Amazon, we remain intrigued by its ambitions in the massive health-care industry, particularly using its logistics prowess on the prescription drug delivery side. The acquisition of One Medical, a primary care provider, also was a big deal \u2014 and at the company's annual shareholder meeting in late May, CEO Andy Jassy said he was \"very excited\" about how its One Medical subscription is \"continuing to grow.\" But in general, health care does seem to have been a tougher nut to crack than perhaps some expected. That's why Friday's report caught our eye because it shows Amazon is looking for ways to make progress and not being complacent with its organizational structures. Still, as of now, it's not a major needle-mover compared with the e-commerce, advertising and cloud-computing divisions. Meta's move: The founder of Scale AI, Alexandr Wang, confirmed that he's departing the startup to join Club name Meta Platforms , part of the Instagram parent's bold move to stay on the leading edge of artificial intelligence. When we wrote Wednesday about Meta investing nearly $15 billion to take a 49% stake in Scale AI, we were under the impression that Wang would join Meta's new \"superintelligence\" unit on top of his duties at the data-labeling startup. That is not the case. The new revelation underscores the aggressiveness of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg amid concerns that some of its AI technology was lagging in performance. Wang is well-known within the tech industry as a bright mind on AI \u2014 he founded Scale AI before he was 20 years old \u2014 and talent along with computing resources is very important in the AI race. Apple shipments: Rounding out these updates on Big Tech names, Reuters reported that 97% of the iPhones exported from India by manufacturer Foxconn went to the U.S. during the March-to-May period. That is a dramatic increase from the roughly 50% export rate in 2024, Reuters said, citing customs data. The reporting is a clear indication of Apple's strategy to navigate President Donald Trump's tariffs by relying less on China, which faces a much-higher duty rate than India. Up next: It's a quite week of earnings within the portfolio, though Lennar and Darden Restaurants are set to report on Monday and Friday, carrying implications for Club names Home Depot and Texas Roadhouse , respectively. Jabil, La-Z-Boy, GMS, Smith and Wesson Brands, Kroger, Accenture, and CarMax also report. The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates and latest economic projections arrive on Wednesday. On the economic calendar, the latest numbers on retail sales and import/export prices are due out Tuesday morning, followed by initial jobless claims on Wednesday morning. Next Friday and into the weekend, the American Diabetes Associations' Scientific Sessions takes place, and Club name Eli Lilly will be there with updates.

Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, who is the chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, was the most senior leader among the dead, according to state media. There was no immediate confirmation from the Iranian armed forces. One of General Bagheri\u2019s deputies was also killed.\n\nIsrael has a history of successfully assassinating Iranian security officials and nuclear scientists. But it has generally picked them off one by one in covert operations as part of its long shadow war with Iran and in Lebanon or Syria.\n\nThe strikes early on Friday proved to be a stunning escalation of that tactic. Not only did they target Iran\u2019s nuclear program and air defenses, the Israeli attacks also eliminated the top tier of military commanders all at once, targeting their residential homes, including some in secure military complexes.

And Iranian air defenses, which had already largely been destroyed last year in Israeli retaliations to Iranian missile attacks, appeared to be nonexistent or were damaged even further.\n\nIran\u2019s so-called \u201cSupreme Leader,\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared to have survived, but senior leaders of Iran\u2019s military did not, nor did key nuclear scientists. And Iran\u2019s nuclear facility at Natanz appeared to have been badly damaged, if not destroyed, in the attacks.\n\nThe IDF issued a statement describing \u201cOperation Rising Lion\u201d:\n\nA short while ago, following the directive of the political echelon, the IDF launched a preemptive, precise, combined offensive based on high-quality intelligence to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and in response to the Iranian regime\u2019s ongoing aggression against Israel. A short while, dozens of IAF jets completed the first stage that included strikes on dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.\nThe public is requested to follow the instructions of the IDF Home Front Command, which will be updated as necessary, and act calmly and responsibly. The IDF and the relevant authorities are prepared for a wide range of scenarios in defense and offense that may be needed.\nFor years, the Iranian regime has been waging a direct and indirect campaign of terror against the State of Israel, by funding and directing terrorist activities via its proxies across the Middle East, while advancing toward obtaining a nuclear weapon. The Iranian regime is at the head of the axis responsible for all terrorist attacks against the State of Israel since the beginning of the \u201cSwords of Iron\u201d War, including by arming and funding the Hamas terror organization which was responsible for the October 7th Massacre. During the \u201cSwords of Iron\u201d War, Iran even directly attacked Israel twice, firing hundreds of missiles toward the State of Israel.\nThe Iranian regime has proclaimed that its objective is to destroy the State of Israel. Senior officials in the Iranian regime have publicly declared their intent to destroy Israel, and are operating to achieve this together with their proxies in the Middle East. Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the wider world. The State of Israel will not allow a regime whose objective is to destroy the State of Israel to obtain weapons of mass destruction.\nThe IDF has conducted a process of preparations for a campaign on the frontline and on the home front. The resilience of Israel\u2019s citizens will be an important factor of the campaign.\nThe IDF is ready to continue to act as required. The State of Israel has the obligation to act in defense of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so, as we have done in the past.\nThe IDF is conducting an ongoing situational assessment and will update on any developments.\n\nSeparately, the IDF released a statement explaining that the Iranian nuclear program had reached a crucial threshold, and that there had been no choice but to act, given the failure of Iran\u2019s negotiations with the U.S.\n\nIn recent months, accumulated intelligence information has provided evidence that the Iranian regime is approaching the point of no return. The convergence of the Iranian regime\u2019s efforts to produce thousands of kilograms of enriched uranium, alongside decentralized and fortified enrichment compounds in underground facilities, enables the Iranian regime to enrich uranium to military-grade levels, enabling the regime to obtain a nuclear weapon within a short period of time. Additionally, in recent years, and more so since the beginning of the war, concrete progress has been identified in the Iranian regime\u2019s efforts to produce weapons components adapted for a nuclear bomb.\nThe Iranian regime has been working for decades to obtain a nuclear weapon. The world has attempted every possible diplomatic path to stop it, but the regime has refused to stop.\nThe IDF is revealing for the first time that the Iranian regime is advancing a secret plan for the technological advancement of all parts of the development of a nuclear weapon. In the framework of this plan, senior nuclear scientists in Iran have been working to secretly develop all components needed for developing a nuclear weapon.\nIn recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon. This is clear evidence that the Iranian regime is operating to obtain a nuclear weapon.\nThe State of Israel has been left with no choice. The IDF has the obligation to act in defense of the civilians of Israel and will continue to do so.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a speech in which he described the necessity of the attack, and appealed directly to the Iranian people \u2014 as he has done before \u2014 to rise up against their leaders.\n\nThe Government Press Office revealed that Netanyahu had placed a note of prayer in the Western Wall \u2014 the holiest site in Judaism \u2014 on Thursday, quoting Numbers 23:24: \u201c\u2018A people that rises up as a lioness, and as a lion lifts himself up\u2019.\u201d\n\nAir raid sirens were sounded throughout Israel on Friday morning \u2014 not because of a specific threat, but to warn the public that the country was now at war with its greatest enemy.\n\nIsraeli airspace was closed to civilian aircraft, and two small Israeli airlines moved their operations to Cyprus.\n\nIran attempted to put on a brave face after the attacks, vowing to retaliate, \u201cBlood for blood.\u201d But it was not clear what it could do. Its air defenses had been destroyed; its terrorist proxies, who launched the war against Israel on October 7, 2023, had been decimated; and much of its general military staff were dead, or in hiding.\n\nJoel B.

Iranian state media later reported that the attack had killed several senior military personnel, including General Hossein Salami, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.While Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, Israeli and Western officials have long accused Tehran of covertly advancing toward weaponization. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Israel's airstrikes hit the Natanz facility, which has been enriching uranium up to 60%\u2014a level seen by many as dangerously close to weapons-grade, The Economic Times reported.The military exchange marked the most direct and extensive confrontation between the two regional powers in decades, raising fears of a broader conflict. Oil prices spiked nearly 9% amid global concern over the destabilizing effects on Middle East security and energy markets.In Washington, the U.S. State Department stated it had no role in the operation, though intelligence cooperation with Israel was widely speculated.

Iranian state media confirmed that Israel killed Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran\u2019s military; Ali Shamkhani, a national security official and advisor to Ayatollah Khamenei; Gen. Gholamali Rashid, a senior military leader; and several senior nuclear scientists, among others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech shortly after Operation Rising Lion began, stating that strikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program would \u201ccontinue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\u201d According to Netanyahu, Iran could have created a nuclear bomb as early as \u201cwithin a few months.\u201d The United States distanced itself from the attack, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying in a statement that the strikes were \u201cunilateral\u201d and that the U.S. was \u201cnot involved.\u201d The statement also warned Iran against attacking any U.S. \u201cinterests or personnel,\u201d adding that the administration\u2019s top priority is \u201cprotecting American forces in the region.\u201d President Donald Trump spoke to Fox News hours later, reiterating that, although he knew about Israel\u2019s attack beforehand, the United States was not involved. \u201cIran cannot have a nuclear bomb and we are hoping to get back to the negotiating table,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see.\u201d Iran threatened retaliation against Israel, while saying that it was also holding the U.S. responsible. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a special state of emergency within Israel, saying that a \u201cmissile and drone attack\u201d is expected against the civilian population in the \u201cimmediate future.\u201d \n\nHours before Israel\u2019s attack on Thursday, Iran had announced plans to open a \u201cthird secure site\u201d for uranium enrichment. The site is \u201calready built, prepared, and located in a secure and invulnerable place,\u201d Iranian officials claimed. The announcement came in response to a decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, to censure Iran for failing to comply with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations. The IAEA\u2019s resolution\u2014its first against Iran in 20 years\u2014followed the agency\u2019s recent report concluding that Iran had amassed more than 900 pounds of 60 percent enriched uranium, enough fissile material for 10 nuclear weapons if enriched further. \n\nAn Air India passenger plane crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, killing more than 290 people\u2014including dozens on the ground\u2014and leaving only one survivor among the aircraft\u2019s 242 passengers and crew. The 12-year-old Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had just departed for London at the time of the crash, the cause of which is still unclear. Indian officials have opened an investigation into the incident, which was the first to involve Boeing\u2019s 787.\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay of District Judge Charles Breyer\u2019s ruling late Thursday night that blocked President Trump from deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles, temporarily restoring Trump\u2019s ability to deploy troops in the city. The three-judge panel scheduled a hearing for Tuesday, with the pause on Breyer\u2019s order continuing at least until then. Breyer\u2019s initial ruling ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, holding that the president\u2019s federalization of the California National Guard exceeded the scope of his authority and violated the 10th Amendment.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 214-212 on Thursday to advance President Trump\u2019s rescission bill, which would codify some Department of Government Efficiency-championed cuts and cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved spending. More than $8 billion of the funds were directed to foreign aid, while the remainder was for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund NPR and PBS. Some GOP lawmakers had previously voiced concerns about cuts to the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, local broadcasting stations, and emergency alerts, but the package passed narrowly after House Speaker Mike Johnson convinced two Republican holdouts to change their votes. The package now faces a vote in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune left open the possibility of Senate changes to the proposed cuts. \n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday that he had officially ordered the deployment of 5,000 National Guard troops and 2,000 state police to manage protests against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy. According to a press release from Abbott\u2019s office, the deployment is to \u201csupport local law enforcement\u201d in bolstering public safety and protecting public property. Thousands of protests across all 50 states are scheduled to take place ahead of Saturday\u2019s military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary. \n\nFederal agents removed Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla from a press conference in Los Angeles held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday, forcing the California senator to the ground and handcuffing him. In videos of the incident, Padilla identified himself after agents began pushing him out of the room and said he had \u201cquestions for the secretary.\u201d Officers with FBI vests then handcuffed the senator in the hallway outside the room. In a statement on X, the Department of Homeland Security said that Padilla had interrupted the press conference, ignored officers\u2019 commands, and lunged towards Secretary Noem. Padilla\u2019s office says he is not currently detained, and Noem told Fox News that she had a \u201ccordial and beneficial\u201d 10-15 minute meeting with Padilla after the incident.", "summary": "\u2018When enemies build weapons of mass death, stop them.\u2019", "url": "https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/morning/israel-strikes-irans-nuclear-sites/", "image": "https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219195402.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 10:57:13", "author": "Charlotte Lawson,Cole Murphy", "authors": ["Charlotte Lawson", "Cole Murphy"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.26}, {"id": 331022650, "title": "Israel Strikes Iran\u2019s Nuclear and Missile Facilities; Iran Retaliates with Drone Attacks", "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 In a major escalation, Israel launched attacks on Iran\u2019s capital early Friday, targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program and resulting in the deaths of at least two high-ranking military officers. This incident significantly increases the risk of an all-out war between these longtime Middle East rivals and is considered the most severe assault Iran has experienced since its conflict with Iraq in the 1980s.\n\nHeightened tensions over Iran\u2019s swiftly advancing nuclear capabilities reached a breaking point, prompting Iran to retaliate swiftly. Iranian forces deployed a barrage of drones against Israel, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowing \u201csevere punishment.\u201d\n\nCountries in the region condemned Israel\u2019s attack, while leaders around the globe called for immediate deescalation from both sides.\n\nAccording to Israel\u2019s military, about 200 aircraft were involved in the initial wave of the attack which targeted roughly 100 sites. Additionally, two security officials revealed that Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency strategically placed explosive drones within Iran in advance, which were later activated to strike missile launchers at a military installation near Tehran.\n\nThey said Israel had also smuggled precision weapons into central Iran as well as strike systems on vehicles, which were activated as the attack began to hit Iranian air defenses.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the highly secretive missions and it was not possible to independently confirm their claims. There was no official comment.\n\nThe Israeli attack hit several sites, including Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. Later in the morning, Israel said it had also destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran.\n\nThe leader of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, was confirmed dead, Iranian state television reported, a significant blow to Tehran\u2019s governing theocracy and an immediate escalation of its long-simmering conflict with Israel.\n\nThe chief of staff of Iranian armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, was also confirmed dead by Iranian state television. Khamenei said other top military officials and scientists were also killed.\n\nIn response, Iran fired more than 100 drones at Israel, with both Iraq and Jordan confirming they had flown over their airspace. Israel said the drones were being intercepted outside its airspace, and it was not immediately clear whether any got through.\n\nThe Trump administration, which had cautioned Israel against an attack during continued negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program, said it had not been involved and warned against any retaliation targeting U.S. interests or personnel.\n\nStill, it seemed likely the U.S. suspected an attack could be in the offing, with Washington on Wednesday pulling some American diplomats from Iraq\u2019s capital and offering voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East.\n\nIsrael calls attacks preemptive strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\n\nIsraeli leaders cast attack as necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, though it remains unclear how close the country is to achieving that or whether Iran had actually been planning a strike. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only.\n\n\u201cIt could be a year. It could be within a few months,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed as he vowed to pursue the attack for as long as necessary to \u201cremove this threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a clear and present danger to Israel\u2019s very survival,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past year, Israel has been targeting Iran\u2019s air defenses, hitting a radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery in April 2024 and surface-to-air missile sites and missile manufacturing facilities in October.\n\nNervous Israelis rushed to supermarkets in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and elsewhere to buy bottled water and other supplies, and circulated messages on WhatsApp groups advising each other to prepare their shelters for potential long-term use.\n\nIran claims Israel targeted residential areas\n\nIsrael \u201copened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,\u201d Khamenei said in a statement.\n\nFor Netanyahu, the operation distracts attention from Israel\u2019s ongoing and increasingly devastating war in Gaza, which is now over 20 months old.\n\nThere is a broad consensus in the Israeli public that Iran is a major threat, and Israel\u2019s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, a staunch critic of Netanyahu, offered his \u201cfull support\u201d for the mission against Iran. But if Iranian reprisals cause heavy Israeli casualties or major disruptions to daily life, public opinion could shift quickly.\n\nNetanyahu expressed hope the attacks would trigger the downfall of Iran\u2019s theocracy, saying his message to the Iranian people was that the fight was not with them, but with the \u201cbrutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that the day of your liberation is near,\u201d the Israeli leader said.\n\nMultiple sites in the Iranian capital were hit in the attack, which Netanyahu said targeted both nuclear and military sites. Also targeted were officials leading Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that an Israeli strike hit Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and said it was closely monitoring radiation levels.\n\nThe strike on Iran pushed the Israeli military to its limits, requiring the use of aging air-to-air refuelers to get its fighter jets close enough to attack. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Israeli jets entered Iranian airspace or just fired so-called \u201cstandoff missiles\u201d over another country. People in Iraq heard fighter jets overhead at the time of the attack. Israel previously attacked Iran from over the border in Iraq.\n\nTension had been growing for weeks ahead of attacks\n\nThe potential for an attack had been apparent for weeks as angst built over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said that he did not believe an attack was imminent but also acknowledged that it \u201ccould very well happen.\u201d\n\nOnce the attacks were underway, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem issued an alert telling American government workers and their families to shelter in place until further notice.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took \u201cunilateral action against Iran\u201d and that Israel advised the U.S. that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense.\n\n\u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,\u201d Rubio said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nTrump is scheduled to attend a meeting of his National Security Council on Friday in the White House Situation Room, where he is expected to discuss the conflict with top advisers.\n\nIsrael has long been determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a concern laid bare on Thursday when the Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years censured Iran over its refusal to work with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site and install more advanced centrifuges.\n\nEven so, there are multiple assessments on how many nuclear weapons Iran could conceivably build, should it choose to do so. Iran would need months to assemble, test and field any weapon, which it so far has said it has no desire to do. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess Iran does not have a weapons program at this time.\n\nIn a sign of the far-reaching implications of the emerging conflict, Israel\u2019s main airport was closed and benchmark Brent crude spiked on news of the attack, rising nearly 8%.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 In a major escalation, Israel launched&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Israel Strikes Iran&#8217;s Nuclear and Missile Facilities; Iran Retaliates with Drone Attacks first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/local-news/israel-strikes-irans-nuclear-and-missile-facilities-iran-retaliates-with-drone-attacks/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Israel-attacks-Iran039s-nuclear-and-missile-sites-Iran-responds-with.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 11:04:05", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.317}, {"id": 331039554, "title": "Israel launches strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and more top headlines", "text": "Good morning and welcome to Fox News\u2019 morning newsletter, Fox News First.

The damage to it appeared to be severe. It is only partially underground and was recently reinforced.\n\nIt contains a range of sophisticated centrifuges, including the most advanced models, for enriching uranium to high levels. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, says there are nearly 14,000 centrifuges at work there, with thousands more in place but inactive.\n\nUranium enriched at low levels can be used as fuel for civilian uses, such as producing energy. Highly enriched uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons.\n\nNatanz has been targeted in the past, with a computer virus, Stuxnet, some 15 years ago, and with sabotage and explosions as recently as 2021. Iran has always in the past repaired the damage and increased the sophistication of its centrifuges.\n\nRafael Grossi, the head of the I.A.E.A., confirmed on Friday that Natanz had been hit but said that no radiation leak had been detected so far. He condemned attacks on nuclear facilities in general, as he has done in Ukraine, as very dangerous.\n\n\u201cAny military action that jeopardizes the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region and beyond,\u201d Mr. Grossi told the agency\u2019s board of governors in Vienna.\n\nIran\u2019s best-protected nuclear site, Fordow, near the city of Qom, is deep inside a mountain, estimated to be about half a mile below ground to protect it from bombing. Israel did not appear to have attacked it.\n\nTo do so would require repeated use of huge \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs, and most experts think that cannot be done by Israel alone, without American help.\n\nFordow was operated secretly by Iran until it was exposed in 2009. It contains Iran\u2019s most advanced centrifuges and is considered crucial for Iran to enrich uranium to 60 percent, close to bomb grade. It is said to contain close to 3,000 sophisticated centrifuges, more than half of them the most modern type, with the capacity to install at least 1,000 more.\n\nParchin is a military complex southeast of the capital, Tehran, where Iran has tested high explosives, which can be used as triggers for nuclear warheads.

My visit to Iran included a visit to the city of Isfahan to tour the uranium conversion facility there. Iran\u2019s primary enrichment facility in Natanz, which was hit in Israel\u2019s June 13 strikes, was not on the itinerary.\n\nDuring my stay, I was able to arrange an interview with Abbasi, who at the time officially held an academic position at Shahid Beheshti University in north Tehran (the website listed him as vice-president for student and cultural affairs, responsible for student healthcare and accommodation, among other things. He also taught nuclear engineering).\n\nHome-Grown Nuclear Research\n\nThe primary thrust of Abbasi\u2019s work, he said, was to encourage home-grown Iranian nuclear research. Sanctions and restrictions on studies abroad, he said, had made it difficult for Iranian students to pursue studies in the field.\n\n\u201cBecause of the limitations imposed on the Iranian students by the Westerners -- and more than any other country, by the United States government -- these limitations were imposed on Iranian students outside Iran in order to deprive them of access to the study and work in the nuclear field and related engineering fields,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided to start the effort to bring the know-how here.\u201d\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Abbasi continued, Iranian students were able to pursue study in Russia.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t about just a simple quest for scientific knowledge. Abbasi also complained about export-control restrictions that slowed down Iran\u2019s ability to acquire some technology.\n\n\u201cWe had to go through nonconventional ways to get the information we needed, either by relying on our young people or getting them for our friends outside of Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nThe interview was a lengthy one. Abbasi ended with a long digression on the history of Iran in the 20th Century: the coup d\u2019etat that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, the fall of the Shah during the Islamic Revolution, the Iran-Iraq War (\u201cthe war that was imposed on us\u201d).\n\nIranian Hostage Crisis\n\nIt was a hardliner\u2019s take on history. The Iran hostage crisis that began in 1979, he said, was a necessity: \u201cAlthough we know it wasn\u2019t according to the international norms, we stormed the den of espionage [the American embassy] and we did so in order to show the world that Americans are trying to stage a coup d\u2019etat in Iran and apply some regime change here so that they return the Shah\u2019s regime back to the country.\u201d\n\nAnd the current international concern about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions? Abbasi claimed it was simply a screen, a pretext for putting pressure on Iran.\n\n\u201cThe nuclear issue is a good excuse now to be used for the propaganda against Iran in the region. If the nuclear issue is not the base issue, there would be other things that would be mentioned. For example, I can say definitely after the nuclear issue there are some other things that the Western countries would put forward \u2013 like women\u2019s rights, children\u2019s rights, Iran\u2019s judiciary system.\u201d\n\nHe did acknowledge one thing: That technology can serve more than one purpose.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian nuclear issue is something like oil, like medicine, like agriculture. And they should know that if you can peel the skin of an orange with a knife, you can kill somebody with it as well.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after the interview, Abbasi would be designated by the UN Security Council for his involvement in Iran\u2019s proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.

Why it struck now.", "text": "Recently, when missiles have been fired from Yemen by the Iran-allied Houthis, Israelis have received cellphone warnings 10 minutes before the air-raid sirens sounded.\n\nThis time things were different. Israelis awoke at 2:59 a.m. Friday to a high-pitched alarm, followed by a phone message from the Homefront Command to stay close their protective spaces.\n\nAs TVs turned on, the dramatic news unfolded: Israel was attacking its archenemy, Iran.\n\nFearing that Iran\u2019s decades-long nuclear enrichment program was geared toward development of a nuclear weapon, Israel has long considered carrying out a preemptive strike. But it has always been put off, because of the heavy toll that the war that is anticipated would result, with its regional implications, could take.\n\nSo why now?\n\nSince the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Iran\u2019s ally Hamas, what had been an Israel-Iran shadow war has come repeatedly into the open, including Israeli strikes that heavily damaged Iran\u2019s air defenses in October 2024, leaving the much larger nation temporarily vulnerable.\n\nIn recent days, amid reports that Trump administration efforts to reach a deal with Iran on its enrichment program were reaching a stalemate, warnings of an Israeli attack proliferated.\n\nThe timing for such an attack was ripe, says Chuck Freilich, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a former deputy Israeli national security adviser. Iran and its regional proxies have been \u201cdramatically weakened\u201d since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a window of opportunity for attacking at hopefully a much lower cost than would have been in the past,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has shown much more readiness to go along with an Israeli attack, even if there was an effort to reach a diplomatic deal to rein in Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\n\n\u201cPlaying for time\u201d\n\nAccording to Sima Shine, head of INSS\u2019 Iran program and former head of a Mossad research division, Israel became convinced in recent days that Iran was not serious in its negotiations and was \u201cplaying for time.\u201d In a briefing with reporters, she said there was an understanding Iran had accumulated so much enriched uranium it could break out for a bomb in a very short time.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attack will now most likely disrupt the U.S.-Iran talks, Professor Freilich says, but it may also increase Iran\u2019s motivation to renew them.\n\nA third point favoring an attack now is a political one, he says. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has \u201cvery clear political reasons for wanting to do this, because if it succeeds, it may be enough to save his political career,\u201d which was badly tarnished by his government\u2019s failure to fend off Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack.\n\nEarly Friday morning Netanyahu spoke to the nation, saying in response to a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d Israel had no choice but to attack.\n\nIn recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs, he explained, and in recent months has taken steps \u201cto weaponize this enriched uranium.\u201d He said Iran was also gearing up to produce 10,000 ballistic missiles within three years.\n\nIntimating that Israel\u2019s aims extended beyond Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Mr. Netanyahu also directed remarks in English to Iranians, saying Israel\u2019s fight was not with Iran\u2019s people but its oppressive regime: \u201cI believe that the day of your liberation is near.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, more than 200 Israeli Air Force jets struck overnight in a \u201cfirst stage\u201d at military targets, nuclear targets and facilities, senior members of the Iranian general staff, and senior scientists of its nuclear programs. The strikes also targeted air defenses in western Iran and ballistic missiles.\n\nIsrael said its jets hit the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, the largest such site in Iran, damaging the underground area containing centrifuges, electrical rooms, and other infrastructure.\n\nIsrael said the strikes also killed the three most senior military commanders of the Iranian regime: armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Hossein Salami; and Gholam-Ali Rashid, head of Iran\u2019s emergency command.\n\nIn retaliation, Iran launched over 100 UAVs toward Israel, many of which were intercepted on the way. \u201cThe threat isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d a military official said in a Zoom briefing. \u201cThese are complex days for the Israeli people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Israel Ziv, a retired general, the Israeli attack has already become a reality \u201cgame changer,\u201d saying the United States should now use Israel\u2019s latest military achievements to reach a \u201cmuch more draconian\u201d agreement with Iran.\n\nThe timing was right, he says, given the assessment that Iran\u2019s weakness would not have continued forever and the fact that the 60-day deadline Mr. Trump had given the Iranians to reach a deal had passed. There is no doubt, he says, that the U.S. green-lighted the attack.\n\nTargeting leadership\n\nHitting military leaders and nuclear scientists would help Israel attain a \u201cmuch more significant achievement\u201d than if it had targeted just the nuclear infrastructure, he says.\n\n\u201cThey are also attacking the nuclear facilities, but it was not the first priority,\u201d General Ziv says. The top priority of the surprise attack was to hit at top Iranian commanders and scientists who otherwise \u201cwould have disappeared.\u201d\n\nIsrael and America\u2019s \u201ccentral motif\u201d going forward, General Ziv says, should now not just be the nuclear issue, but the toppling of the current Iranian leadership as well. \u201cWe must break down all of the regime, the economy, whatever we can to make sure they cannot come back from this.\u201d\n\nIran will likely retaliate with \u201cwhatever they have,\u201d General Ziv says. But much of Iran\u2019s arsenal has been damaged, \u201csignificantly\u201d lowering the threat to Israel.\n\nThe INSS\u2019 Professor Freilich also said the U.S. must use Israel\u2019s strike to advance its nuclear talks with Iran, but added hopefully also a resolution of the Gaza war and Israel\u2019s conflict with the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cWe need a diplomatic agreement to achieve long-term change,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd of course, the really big question would be, if we had some ... broader diplomatic endgame after this, certainly in Gaza, and maybe on the Palestinian issue as a whole.\u201d", "summary": "Israel has long feared Iran\u2019s nuclear program was geared toward developing a weapon.

In a statement the Israeli military said that fighter jets had struck Iran's largest enrichment facility at Natanz. \"As part of the strikes, the underground area of the site was damaged. This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure,\" the statement read in part.\n\nVideo posted online and verified by NPR showed black smoke billowing from the Natanz site early Friday morning local time. A set of images from the commercial satellite company Airbus showed damage to the main electrical substation at the facility and to buildings used to assemble and run centrifuges.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, there were additional reports of Israeli strikes near Iran's other main enrichment facility at Fordow, and at Isfahan, which is also home to a nuclear research complex. So far, little is known about those strikes, which have taken place in the second night of fighting.\n\nIn a statement, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said that the attack at the Natanz plant caused damage but that no radioactive or chemical contamination had leaked outside the site.\n\nRafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, condemned the attack.\n\n\"I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities must never be attacked, regardless of the context or circumstances,\" Grossi said during a meeting of the agency's board of governors.\n\nThe Natanz facility has been at the center of Iran's nuclear program for decades. According to the IAEA, which has been monitoring activities at the site for the past several years, Iran has recently been using thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium to 60%, far above the levels normally used in civilian nuclear reactors. The agency says that Iran has stockpiled more than 400 kilograms of the highly enriched material, enough by some estimates to quickly build around 10 nuclear weapons.\n\nIt's unclear how quickly that material could practically be converted into bombs. During the enrichment process, the uranium is stored as a gas. It must be separated and converted into metal, which in turn must be fashioned into components for a nuclear device. Iran had a covert program to research such a weapon in the early 2000s, but it has never built a nuclear weapon before, and has said publicly it has no intentions to pursue one.\n\nIn a statement shortly after the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel believed Iran had recently restarted its program to build a nuclear weapon. \"If not stopped, Iran could produce a weapon in a very short time,\" he said in prepared remarks shortly after the strike. The operation's goal, Netanyahu stated, was to \"strike at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program.\"\n\nPreliminary analysis of satellite imagery at the site suggests the damage from the first wave of attacks was actually limited, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who has tracked Iran's program.\n\nImages from satellite company Airbus showed damage to several buildings at the Natanz site that are used to assemble centrifuges. The images also showed damage to support equipment, including an electrical substation and buildings that may provide power and access to the underground structures at the site.\n\n\"That's likely to disrupt operations at the plant, but crucially, what they didn't do was find a way to destroy the thousands of centrifuges that are buried underground,\" Lewis says.\n\nLewis also saw no evidence that Israel had struck at tunnels deep beneath a nearby mountain. Iran was reportedly digging those tunnels to create a more fortified facility for its centrifuges. In recent days it had pledged that it would accelerate development of a third centrifuge site, possibly in the mountain facility.\n\nLewis says he wonders whether military force can truly eliminate Iran's nuclear program. In the end, he says, there is no single facility or scientist that holds the key to the entire nuclear enterprise in Iran.\n\n\"Unless the Israelis can keep bombing them indefinitely,\" he says, \"they will always have the ability to technically reconstitute the program if they make a decision to do so.\"", "summary": "Early satellite imagery appears to show some damage at Iran's main site.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5432607/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-facilities-expand", "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2000x1143+0+0/resize/2000x1143!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fc6%2F40ab278847c8984f7677966e9476%2Fnatanz-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 20:07:23", "author": "Geoff Brumfiel", "authors": ["Geoff Brumfiel"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.251}, {"id": 331188358, "title": "Israel\u2019s Next Target is Fordo, Iran\u2019s Second-Largest Nuclear Site Hidden in a Mountain", "text": "The divergent reactions reflected a political divide over President Trump\u2019s leadership, the use of military force, the role of diplomacy and America\u2019s obligations in the Middle East.\n\nSome Republicans in Congress applauded the operation even before President Trump praised it.\n\n\u201cGame on,\u201d declared Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the most vocal Iran hawks on Capitol Hill, moments after the news broke. In a later statement, Mr. Graham said: \u201cHats off to Israel for one of the most impressive military strikes and covert operations in Israeli history.\u201d\n\nThe House speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also offered unequivocal support for the strikes, saying in a social media post late Thursday that \u201cIsrael IS right \u2014 and has a right \u2014 to defend itself!\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump weighed in Friday morning, saying that Iran had brought the attacks on itself, Mr. Johnson applauded the administration\u2019s decision to back Israel\u2019s security goals and echoed the president\u2019s position that Iran \u201cmust never obtain a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson, who recently announced a trip to Israel later this month to address a special session of the Knesset, displayed the same frustration that many on Capitol Hill have expressed in recent weeks over Tehran\u2019s refusal to shelve its nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and his administration have worked tirelessly to ensure that outcome. Unfortunately, Iran has refused to agree and even declared yesterday its intent to build a new enrichment facility,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday.\n\nSenator James E. Risch, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, had a similar message, saying, \u201cWe stand with Israel tonight and pray for the safety of its people and the success of this unilateral, defensive action.\u201d\n\nHours after the attack, the Senate majority leader, John Thune of South Dakota, said that he strongly supported the strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, and in a statement said that the regime and its proxies had positioned themselves as an anti-democratic threat to the region.\n\n\u201cFor too long, the mullahs in Iran have publicly aspired to wipe the only democracy in the Middle East off the face of the map via any means possible: funding and arming terror groups on Israel\u2019s borders, choking off international sea lanes, and multiple barrages of missiles and drones,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nThe top two Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, said in separate statements that they were closely monitoring the situation as it continued to unfold.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 commitment to Israel\u2019s security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran\u2019s response,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement on Friday afternoon. He and Mr. Jeffries both emphasized the \u201cironclad\u201d U.S.-Israel relationship and denounced Iran\u2019s defiance of its nuclear obligations, reiterating the dangers of a nuclear Iran to both the United States and the entire Middle East.\n\n\u201cThere is no circumstance where Iran can be permitted to become a nuclear power,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said in a statement, adding an urgent call for international leaders to \u201cfind a rigorous diplomatic path forward and avoid any situation where U.S. troops are put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nAmong Democrats, no lawmaker has been more vocally supportive of Israel than Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has carved out a distinct role as the party\u2019s most unapologetic defender of the U.S.-Israel alliance.\n\nIn the hours after the strike, Mr. Fetterman posted on social media: \u201cOur commitment to Israel must be absolute and I fully support this attack. Keep wiping out Iranian leadership and the nuclear personnel. We must provide whatever is necessary \u2014 military, intelligence, weaponry \u2014 to fully back Israel in striking Iran.\u201d\n\nAnd several strongly pro-Israel Democrats in the House praised the strikes. Representative Greg Landsman of Ohio swiftly issued a statement proclaiming: \u201cIsrael is justifiably defending itself and its people.\u201d\n\nBut other Democrats called for de-escalation or expressed concern that Israel\u2019s military action could lead to broader regional instability.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s strikes against Iran represent an escalation that is deeply concerning and will inevitably invite counterattacks,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThis risks not only U.S. negotiations with Iran, but the safety of American service members, diplomats, their families and expats around the region.\u201d\n\nSenator Jack Reed, the top Democrat of the Armed Services Committee, echoed those concerns.\n\n\u201cI urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world cannot afford more devastating conflict born of shortsighted violence.\u201d\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a statement a war between Israel and Iran \u201cmay be good for Netanyahu\u2019s domestic politics, but it will likely be disastrous for both the security of Israel, the United States, and the rest of the region.\u201d He added that the United States has \u201c no obligation to follow Israel into a war we did not ask for and will make us less safe.\u201d\n\nAt least one right-wing Republican voiced the same the sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m sad to say but some members of Congress and US Senators seem giddy about the prospects of a bigger war,\u201d Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, wrote on social media.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/12/world/israel-iran-us-nuclear/fordo-iran-nuclear-site", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/13/multimedia/13israel-iran-Fordow-pclm/13israel-iran-Fordow-pclm-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 18:33:24", "author": "Aaron Boxerman,Ben Hubbard,Farnaz Fassihi,Gabby Sobelman,Helene Cooper,Isabel Kershner,Lara Jakes,Michael D.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and \n joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won\u2019t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America.

We have \n trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There\u2019s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress.

That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can\u2019t do it unless you \u2014 \n the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment \u2014 have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth.

We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need \n revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent \n we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and \n lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters \n and editors.

So, you know, connect those dots however you'd like.

No, none of them show Antonio Brown nearly murdering someone, but you can hear gunshots in one. Another shows Brown being jumped. Well, he said he was \"jumped\" at the time.

A Miami Police Department spokesman previously told Fox News Digital the department received an alert of shots fired at around 3 a.m. May 17. Police initiated an investigation. No arrests were made and no one was injured, the spokesman said at the time. Obviously, a month later, things have changed.

Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\u201d\n\nIran suffered heavy losses Thursday night, including Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and multiple nuclear scientists. Tehran also claimed the strikes resulted in several child casualties before launching more than 100 suicide drones in a retaliatory attack against Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a televised speech following the attack that the offensive could continue for days or weeks.\n\nTrump administration officials have already conducted multiple rounds of negotiations with Tehran on brokering a new nuclear agreement.

They\u2019ve backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address to the world. \u201cIn recent months, Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before, steps to weaponize this enriched uranium, and if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year, it could be within a few months, less than a year. This is a clear and present danger to Israel\u2019s very survival.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael has shown that we have learned the lessons of history. When enemies vowed to destroy you, believe them.

We have risen like lions to defend ourselves.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: NEXT ATTACKS WILL BE \u2018MORE BRUTAL\u2019: President Donald Trump, who had advance word of the attacks, warned Iran in a social media post this morning that the worst is yet to come and to make a deal with the U.S. before it\u2019s too late. Here\u2019s the full text:\n\nI gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to \u201cjust do it,\u201d but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn\u2019t get it done.\n\nI told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come \u2013 And they know how to use it.\n\nCertain Iranian hardliner\u2019s spoke bravely, but they didn\u2019t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!\n\nThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.\n\nIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d\n\nRUBIO: \u2018WE ARE NOT INVOLVED\u2019: Last night, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement disavowing any responsibility for Israel\u2019s actions and warning Tehran not to retaliate against the U.S. military in the region. \u201cLet me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,\u201d Rubio said, acknowledging the U.S. had advanced word of the strike. \u201cIsrael advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners.\u201d\n\nIn a brief phone call with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, President Donald Trump expressed the hope the Israeli strike would not derail the negotiations for a new nuclear deal with Iran, and Baier related on Fox last night. \u201cHe gave me a quote. He said Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb. We\u2019re hoping to get back to the negotiating table,\u201d Baier said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d the president said. \u201cThere are several people in leadership in Iran that will not be coming back.\u201d\n\nIranian state television reported that among the dead is Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces.\u201d\n\nJust before the strikes happened, but after he knew they were coming, Trump posted this on his Truth Social account: \u201cWe remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue! My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran. They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon.\u201d\n\nIRAN: \u2018SEVERE PUNISHMENT WILL BE INFLICTED UPON ISRAEL\u2019: Judging from the rhetoric on its official X account, Iran is in no mood to negotiate. Its immediate response was to launch 100 drones against Israel, which Israel claims to have mostly shot down with its Iron Dome and other air defense systems.\n\n\u201cDefending Iran\u2019s territorial integrity and national sovereignty is the undeniable responsibility of the government and the armed forces. Retaliation for this aggression is Iran\u2019s legitimate right, and with the \u2018powerful hand of the armed forces\u2019 and under the command of the Leadership, severe punishment will be inflicted upon Israel,\u201d the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran posted on X.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s attack last night on Iranian soil, which resulted in the martyrdom of citizens, commanders, and nuclear scientists, is a blatant violation of international law and a terrorist act,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe government has already initiated necessary measures to \u2018make Israel regret\u2019 its actions and has called on the United Nations Security Council to take a stance regarding this breach of international peace.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry also had a message for the United States. \u201cThe aggressive actions of the Zionist regime against Iran could not have been carried out without coordination with and approval of the United States. Thus, the U.S. government, as the main supporter of this regime, will be held responsible for the dangerous consequences of Israel\u2019s adventurism.\u201d\n\nGood Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre\u2019s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie.

The hardest decision any leader has to make is thwarting danger before it is fully materialized. Nearly a century ago, facing the Nazis, a generation of leaders failed to act in time. They were paralyzed by the horrors of World War I. They were determined to avoid war at all costs, and they got the worst war ever. They adopted a policy of appeasement. They closed their eyes and ears to all the warning signs. That failure to act resulted in World War II, the deadliest war in history. It claimed the lives of 60 million, including 6,000,000 Jews, one-third of my people. After that war, the Jewish people and the Jewish state vowed \u2018Never again.\u2019 Well, \u2018Never again\u2019 is now.\u201d\n\nSEN. ROGER WICKER (R-MS), ARMED SERVICES CHAIRMAN: \u201cTonight, we stand firmly alongside Israel and its unilateral preemptive strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran\u2019s sprint to become a nuclear threat to America and our allies, while leading the world in proliferating terrorism, is the cause of this conflict. The single worst decision Iran could make now is to target American service members. I\u2019m confident General Kurilla and Secretary Hegseth have prepared our forces in the region for the threat environment they face.\n\nSEN. JACK REED (D-RI): \u201cIsrael\u2019s alarming decision to launch airstrikes on Iran is a reckless escalation that risks igniting regional violence. These strikes threaten not only the lives of innocent civilians but the stability of the entire Middle East and the safety of American citizens and forces. While tensions between Israel and Iran are real and complex, military aggression of this scale is never the answer. I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control. President Trump must be crystal clear with the American people and the international community in charting a way forward. The world cannot afford more devastating conflict born of short-sighted violence.\u201d\n\nREP. BRIAN MAST (R-FL) FOREIGN AFFAIRS CHAIRMAN: \u201cA year ago, Iran sent three Americans home under flag-draped caskets who were killed at Tower 22. Within the last three months, Iran attacked navy warships. What Israel\u2019s preemptive strike ensured tonight is that Iran\u2019s next attack will not be with a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nREP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): \u201cAs we work to understand the situation that is developing in the Middle East tonight, I urge both sides to do what they can to prevent further escalation of violence. Too many innocent civilians are at risk of getting caught in the crossfire, and leaders of both countries should proceed with caution.\u201d\n\nREP. RICK CRAWFORD (R-AR) INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: \u201cI will say I regret that we have come to this breaking point. However, under no circumstance can Iran get its hands on a nuclear weapon. A nuclear Iran would only embolden our adversaries and not only pose an undeniable threat to Israel, but also the United States and our Arab allies. Iran pushed the world to this point through its blatant, relentless, destabilizing behavior. Israel and others in the region have every right to take the actions needed to defend themselves. I commend the Trump administration for its tireless efforts to bring peace and stability to the region. I am hopeful a remedy is reached sooner rather than later to stabilize this situation before the stakes get any higher.\u201d\n\nSEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA) INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN: \u201cThis is a rapidly evolving situation, and it\u2019s critical that the United States work with our allies and avoid steps that will cause further escalation across the region. For years, Iran has threatened the safety of Israel and the region and Israel has an undeniable right to defend itself and its citizens. At the moment, my foremost concern is the safety of American troops, diplomats, and personnel stationed throughout the Middle East. As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am carefully monitoring developments and staying in close contact with our intelligence and national security agencies.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL MAKOVSKY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, JEWISH INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY OF AMERICA: \u201cIsrael\u2019s bold action has hit the pause button on Iran\u2019s dangerously accelerating nuclear program. Not just Israel, but the United States and the entire Middle East are safer as a result. Just as it did when it decimated Hezbollah and eliminated Assad\u2019s arsenals last year, Israeli daring has once again dramatically changed the region for the better.\u201d\n\nA TIMELY REPORT: The Foundation for Defense of Democracies is out this morning with an exhaustive analysis of the threat of nuclear coercion posed by the growing cooperation of Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. The report, \u201cNuclear Cooperation Among the \u2018Axis of Aggressors\u2019: An Emerging Threat,\u201d warns the U.S. faces an \u201cunprecedented threat environment\u201d with the four countries trading both scientific expertise and scientific expertise and key nuclear-related equipment and materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and its allies may have to contend with substantial nuclear coercion \u2014 either in the form of more aggressive conventional military threats since axis members may believe the United States is deterred by the threat of nuclear escalation \u2014 or via the threat of limited nuclear strikes. Both possibilities imperil American interests and restrain U.S. freedom of action,\u201d the report warns.\n\nOf particular interest is a chart showing the breakout time for Iran to join the nuclear club with a nuclear weapon of its own.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Institute for Science and International Security, as of May 2025, Tehran has enough enriched uranium that \u2014 if further enriched \u2014 the regime could use to make up to 21 nuclear weapons in five months, with additional months required to weaponize the material into nuclear devices,\u201d noted the report, which was written before yesterday\u2019s strikes by Israel. \u201cIran would likely require around six months to build a so-called \u2018crude\u2019 nuclear device and has enough highly enriched uranium to fuel nearly seven weapons for such a device.\u201d\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: Iran warns of \u2018bitter, painful fate\u2019 before launching retaliatory strike against Israel\n\nWashington Examiner: Israel launches strikes against Iran on same day Trump objected to attacks\n\nWashington Examiner: Iran threatens nuclear escalation after UN watchdog finds noncompliance\n\nWashington Examiner: Netanyahu survives opposition attempt to wedge ultra-Orthodox in confidence vote\n\nWashington Examiner: House sends $9.4 billion rescissions package to Senate after narrow victory\n\nWashington Examiner: Cracks in Congress rupture with Padilla detainment, screaming matches, and interparty scraps\n\nWashington Examiner: Pete Hegseth\u2019s Capitol Hill marathon ends after three days: What you need to know\n\nWashington Examiner: Hegseth indicates Pentagon has plans to take Greenland, Panama by force\n\nWashington Examiner: Republicans urge ICE to prioritize arrests of illegal immigrants to those who have committed crimes\n\nWashington Examiner: Judge orders Trump to relinquish control of National Guard to California, says deployment illegal\n\nWashington Examiner: Ninth Circuit halts court order for Trump to return National Guard control to Newsom\n\nWashington Examiner: South Korea seeking Chinese help improving ties with North Korea\n\nWashington Examiner: Why Trump\u2019s clever name game with Army bases is \u2018middle finger\u2019 to Congress\n\nWashington Examiner: Congress sends bill to Trump that classifies fentanyl as Schedule I drug\n\nBreaking Defense: House GOP Appropriators Pass Defense Spending Bill Defeating Dem Measures on Air Force One, Ukraine\n\nAP: Trump\u2019s Deployment of Troops to LA Protest Divides US Governors\n\nMilitary.com: Guard Soldiers Deployed in Trump\u2019s LA Crackdown Aren\u2019t Getting Paid Yet\n\nMilitary.com: Army Officials Pushed Back on Pop-Up MAGA Shop Ahead of Fort Bragg Trump Speech\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Pentagon May Abandon Wedgetail Buy in Favor of Navy\u2019s Hawkeye, Satellites\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Air Force Reveals First Image of LRSO Nuclear Cruise Missile\n\nSpace News: Pentagon\u2019s Mega-Constellation Still Hampered By Supply Chain Issues: GAO Report\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Air Force Moves Ahead with Military\u2019s First Microreactor\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: JetZero to Build Blended Wing-Body Aircraft in North Carolina\n\nMilitary Times: Soldier Killed, Another Injured in Fort Campbell Helicopter Incident\n\nThe War Horse: Who\u2019s Winning the Multibillion Dollar Battle Over Veterans Benefits?\n\nTask & Purpose: Most Military Families On Base Don\u2019t Know Their Rights As Tenants, Survey Finds\n\nTHE CALENDAR: \n\nFRIDAY | JUNE 13\n\n10 a.m. \u2014 National Institute for Deterrence Studies virtual seminar: \u201cThe Implications of a Nuclear Armed South Korea,\u201d with retired South Korean Lt.

On Thursday afternoon, as Israel\u2019s final attack preparations were underway, Mr. Trump told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t want them going in\u201d because \u201cI think it would blow it\u201d with the talks.

to act now.\"\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency throughout the country in anticipation of retaliatory attacks.\n\n\"Following the State of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the state of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future, Katz said.\n\nIran's pursuit of a nuclear arsenal triggered the military strike by Israel as diplomatic efforts failed to divert Iran from its efforts to become a nuclear power.\n\n\"Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and to the wider world,\" the IDF said.\n\nThe action is being coordinated with the United States, according to the IDF.\n\nThe Israeli military strike against Iran would not be supported by the United States, NBC News, The New York Times and ABC News reported earlier on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, U.S. and Iranian representatives discussed a potential agreement that would enable Iran to enrich uranium for energy but not to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Trump administration was awaiting a response from Iran regarding the potential agreement framework, but Iranian negotiators have become more \"hardline\" during the process, President Donald Trump said.\n\nThe hardline stance by Iranian leaders caused the Trump administration on Wednesday to order non-essential staff with the Defense and State departments to leave the Middle East due to reports of a pending Israeli strike on Iran.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had pressured Trump to approve an Israeli strike against Iran before it produces a nuclear warhead and while Iran is vulnerable, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump says he prefers to negotiate a nuclear non-proliferation agreement with Iran, which Iran's hardline stance made more difficult to achieve.\n\nU.S. and Iranian negotiators were scheduled to meet in Oman on Sunday, but Trump has said Iran has adopted \"unacceptable\" negotiation demands.\n\nBritain has announced new threats against commercial shipping in the Middle East, and Trump on Wednesday told the New York Post he has become less confident that Iran won't pursue the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem on Thursday limited movement by its employees in anticipation of a potential Israeli military strike against Iran and its uranium enrichment facilities.\n\nIsrael opposes any form of uranium enrichment by Iran, which the board of governors for the International Atomic Energy Agency recently concluded is not complying with existing nuclear agreements.\n\nIran's military has begun drills that are aimed at targeting enemy movements after learning of the potential Israeli strike, The Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nIAEA investigators found man-made uranium particles at three locations in Iran in 2019 and 2020 and in a recent quarterly report announced Iran has enough enriched uranium to develop nine nuclear warheads.\n\n\"We have been seeking explanations and clarifications from Iran for the presence of these uranium particles,\" IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Iran has repeatedly either not answered or not provided technically credible answers,\" Grossi said.\n\nIranian officials have tried to sanitize the sites and thwart IAEA inspectors, he added.", "summary": "Israel Defense Forces launched early morning aerial attacks against dozens of nuclear sites in Iran on Friday to prevent the Islamic nation from developing nuclear

Hossein Salami\n\nGen. Hossein Salami was the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a central power broker in the country.\n\nLike most senior Iranian commanders, Salami made a name for himself during the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988. He became deputy commander of the IRGC in 2009 before assuming full control in 2019.\n\nSalami was known for his hard-line rhetoric and boasting of Iran\u2019s military capabilities, even claiming that the country was \u201con the verge of becoming a world power,\u201d the BBC reported.\n\nOne day before his death on Friday, he said Iran was \u201cfully ready for any scenarios, situations, and circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe enemy thinks it can fight Iran the same way it fights defenceless Palestinians who are under an Israeli siege,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are war-tested and experienced.\u201d\n\nThe IRGC was established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution as a counterweight to the armed forces, viewed with distrust due to its previous loyalty to the Shah. It has since morphed into one of the biggest stakeholders of Iranian power, with some analysts believing it controls roughly one-third of the Iranian economy.\n\nSalami\u2019s death was confirmed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who appointed Major Gen. Mohammad Pakpour as his replacement.\n\nMohammad Bagheri\n\nMajor Gen. Mohammad Bagheri was the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, the second most powerful man in the country behind Khameini.\n\nHe made a name for himself during the Iran-Iraq War, serving in a military intelligence unit. His brother, Hassan, reportedly founded the IRGC\u2019s military intelligence unit during the war and served with distinction as a division commander, ultimately being killed by Iraqi forces. Bagheri took over the branch in 1983 after his brother\u2019s death, according to Iranian media cited by Al Jazeera.\n\nLike most Iranian military figures, Mohammad Bagheri kept a secretive persona but was closely involved in IRGC operations. He was promoted to chief of staff of the armed forces in 2016.\n\nAs head of the armed forces, Bagheri commanded 500,000 active personnel.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Khameini, who appointed Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi as his replacement.\n\nGen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh\n\nGen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh was head of the IRGC Aerospace Forces, which oversaw Iran\u2019s ballistic missile forces. He was tapped as responsible for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile strikes against Israel last year, and a 2019 drone and missile strike against Saudi oil facilities.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said he was killed in an airstrike against an underground command center.\n\n\u201cHajizadeh publicly pledged allegiance to the idea of destroying Israel on multiple occasions in recent years and played a central role in formulating the plan to destroy Israel,\u201d a statement from the IDF read.\n\nGholamali Rashid\n\nGholamali Rashid served as Deputy Chief of the General Staff of Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, putting him high up in the chain of command behind Bagheri. He was a major commander during the Iran-Iraq War.\n\nKhameini confirmed his death and appointed Major General Ali Shadmani as his replacement.\n\nAli Shamkhani\n\nAli Shamkhani was head of Iran\u2019s Expediency Discernment Council of the System, one of the country\u2019s most senior advisory bodies. He was also known as a key diplomat and close adviser to Khameini.\n\nShamkhani represented Iran in high-level China-brokered peace talks with Saudi Arabia, leading to the two re-establishing diplomatic ties after a long-running cold war. Most recently, he took part in nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\nHe was mortally wounded in an Israeli airstrike, dying shortly after in the hospital.\n\nISRAEL LAUNCHES MAJOR ATTACK ON IRAN OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nNuclear scientists\n\nIranian state media confirmed the death of six nuclear scientists. \n\nAmong them were Fereydoon Abbasi, former head of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization; Mohammad Mahdi Tehranchi, president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran and a major figure in Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program; Abdulhamid Minouchehr, head of nuclear engineering at Shahid Beheshti University; Ahmad Reza Zolfaghari, nuclear engineering professor at Shahid Beheshti University; Amirhossein Feqhi, a nuclear professor at the university; and a nuclear scientist who was identified only as Motallebzadeh, who was allegedly killed along with his wife.\n\nAbbasi had survived an assassination attempt in 2010, which killed fellow nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari.

These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board.

He knows I have been balding for many years. Although I have accepted my follicular fate, he knows I constantly search for self-improvement in my life.\n\nWhat bothers me is that he didn't share the information until I mentioned I was thinking about trying Rogaine. THAT is when he told me he has been using a similar product for the past year and it seems to be working. He even took off his baseball cap (which he has been curiously wearing for a year), to show me the modest results. I doubt he would have shared this if I hadn't raised the subject.\n\nI feel deeply shafted by his secrecy, and I don't see it as such a private matter that it had to be concealed. I do understand that he may have felt embarrassed to admit it bothered him and that he was taking steps to address the issue.\n\nWhat is the rule of etiquette under the circumstances? Should a person share self-improvement methods that are modestly successful with a close friend who would clearly benefit from the information (assuming it is not so personal or private that it cannot be shared)? \u2014 SHAFTED IN PENNSYLVANIA\n\nDEAR SHAFTED: There is no rule of etiquette that dictates anyone MUST share this kind of information. As close as you may think you are to this friend, try to remember that not everyone is comfortable talking about medical interventions they are using for self-improvement. This includes plastic surgery, weight-loss drugs and cures for baldness (a condition suffered by members of both sexes). Your friend was nice to mention that he has been using a product similar to the one you are contemplating, but he was under no requirement to do so.\n\nDEAR ABBY: I recently separated from my wife and have developed feelings for someone new, \"Maria.\" However, Maria has mentioned that she's currently dating someone.

The company says the affected units were manufactured between January 1, 2016, and October 30, 2019, and sold between June 2016 and December 31, 2022.\nThe power banks were sold through the likes of Amazon, Newegg and eBay and if you own one, you should stop using it right away.

The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known.\n\nStocks broadly got some help from easing Treasury yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation.

While lower rates can goose the economy by encouraging businesses and households to borrow, they can also accelerate inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.35% from 4.41% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% early this year.\n\nBesides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs across the country.\n\n\"We believe that were it not for the uncertainty caused by the tariffs, the combined information coming from the inflation and labor-market data would have compelled the Fed to have resumed cutting its policy rate by now,\" according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for next week, but the nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will stand pat again. Traders are betting it's likely to begin cutting in September, according to data from CME Group.\n\nTrump's on-and-off tariffs have raised worries about higher inflation and a possible recession, which had sent the S&P 500 roughly 20% below its record a couple months ago. But stocks have since rallied nearly all the way back on hopes that Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries.\n\nMany of Trump's tariffs are on hold at the moment to give time for negotiations, but Trump added to the uncertainty late Wednesday when he suggested the United States could send letters to other countries at some point \"saying this is the deal.

U.S. officials noted that the strikes were carried out unilaterally by Israel and there was no U.S. involvement.

Brent crude, the international standard, climbed $4.58 to $73.94 per barrel, also the largest single-day jump since the Russian invasion.\n\nOil prices are likely to rise in the short term but the key question is whether exports are affected, said Richard Joswick, head of near-term oil at S&P Global Commodity Insights. \u201cWhen Iran and Israel exchanged attacks previously, prices spiked initially but fell once it became clear that the situation was not escalating and there was no impact on oil supply,\u201d he wrote in an emailed analysis.\n\n\u201cOil price risk premiums could rise sharply if Iran conducts broader retaliatory attacks, especially if on targets other than in Israel,\u201d Joswick said.\n\nChina is the only customer for Iranian oil but could seek alternative supplies from Middle Eastern exporters and Russia, he said.\n\nIran\u2019s oil trade is restricted by Western sanctions and import bans, and Israel exports only small amounts of oil and oil products.\n\nBoeing shares are down 1% after falling nearly 5% Thursday when one of the aerospace giant\u2019s planes crashed in India, killing all but one of the 242 people on board as well as several on the ground. The plane operated by Air India was the first fatal crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since it went into service in 2009.\n\nThe cause of the crash is unknown.\n\nGE Aerospace, which makes engines for Boeing, is down close to 2% after it announced it was postponing next week\u2019s investor day in light of the tragic crash.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 1.3% and the CAC 40 in Paris gave up 0.9%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.35% from 4.41% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% early this year.\n\nIn currency trading early Friday, the U.S. dollar rose to 144.12 yen, while the euro eased to $1.1511. The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys fell to 4.35%. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nTreasurys and the dollar often rise when investors feel less inclined to take risks.\n\nComing later Friday is the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment report.\n\nNext week brings the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting where it will make a decision on its benchmark interest rate. The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that the U.S. central bank will stand pat again.\n\nThe Fed has been hesitant to lower interest rates, and it\u2019s been on hold this year after cutting at the end of last year, because it\u2019s waiting to see how much President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation.\n\nIn Asia, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.9% to 37,834.25 while the Kospi in Seoul edged 0.9% lower to 2,894.62. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng retreated 0.6% to 23,892.56 and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.8% to 3,377.00. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 drifted 0.2% lower to 8,547.40.\n\n\u201cAn Israeli attack on Iran poses a top ten of our global risk, but Asian markets are expected to recover quickly as they have relatively limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties to unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE,\u201d said Xu Tiachen of The Economist Intelligence.\n\nAP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed.

Iran's nuclear program has long been a focal point of U.S. and Israeli concern, with Tehran insisting its efforts are solely for energy purposes.\"Sleeper cells\" refer to covert terrorist operatives who remain inactive until activated\u2014a concept that gained heightened attention following the September 11 attacks. In the aftermath, Islamophobia and xenophobia surged, with people from Iran and other countries in the region often stereotyped and wrongly associated with terrorism despite no evidence of wrongdoing or malicious activity.The MAGA movement, rooted in \"America First\" ideology, frequently raises alarm over immigration and national security. Alarmist information on social media often circulates quickly.What To Know Following Israeli air strikes on Iran that killed several top officials and struck a main uranium enrichment plant in Natanz, many MAGA voices have warned about potential repercussions stateside.Loomer, a conservative personality and supporter of President Donald Trump, warned Americans about going out in public, writing on X, formerly Twitter: \"Be very careful today and this weekend in American cities and tourist locations, especially if you are going to be in DC.\"Her comments are in reference to the expected celebrations and protests in the capital on Saturday for President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary and hundreds of \"No Kings\" demonstrations.Plans for the parade called for some 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, and 50 helicopters to follow a route from Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press.\"Iran has many sleeper cells in the US,\" Loomer wrote. \"Iranian proxies from HAMAS and Hezbollah will likely retaliate on US soil to kill Americans in acts of Islamic terror as a form of retaliation to the Israeli air strikes.\"There is no public evidence to back her claims.She concluded her post, without citing any data, by saying: \"There are millions of jihadi sleeper cells in our country thanks to the Democrats open border polices.\"Charlie Kirk, the conservative founder and president of Turning Point USA, added a similar sentiment in a Friday post, writing: \"Keep your head on a swivel. Biden let millions of people into America. Iran might activate some sleeper cells against Americans.\"He concluded his post by calling for Americans to prepare by taking up guns, writing: \"Stay armed.\"The U.S. intelligence committee's annual threat assessment warns that \"Iran also will continue to directly threaten U.S. persons globally and remains committed to its decade-long effort to develop surrogate networks inside the United States.\" However, unlike the social media warnings, the assessment said: \"Iran seeks to target former and current U.S. officials it believes were involved in the killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-Qods Force Commander Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.\"The United States designates Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.What People Are SayingJack Posobiec, conservative activist, on X on Thursday night: \"BREAKING: FBI REPORTEDLY MOBILIZING COUNTER-TERRORISM TASK FORCES ON ALERT STATUS FOR POTENTIAL IRAN SLEEPER CELL ACTIVITY\"Robby Starbuck, a filmmaker who campaigns against DEI policies, on X on Friday: \"There's a very real risk of Iranian sleeper cells attacking the US on our soil.

While declaring a state of emergency throughout the entire country, Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that retaliatory strikes were expected.\n\n\"Following the State of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future,\" a message from Katz read.\n\nThe Associated Press shared that explosions were reported in Tehran. The outlet added that the explosions had been acknowledged by state television in Iran. An unnamed Israeli official who spoke to the AP said that the wave of attacks targeted nuclear sites and military outposts.\n\nIt is not the first missile exchange between the two countries since Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7. In late 2024, Iran launched an air attack on several sites in Israel, with many of the missiles being intercepted. Israel attacked key parts of Iran's air defense system that same month.\n\nThe strike comes after days of President Donald Trump hoping that cooler heads would prevail. The U.S. and Iran are in the middle of talks around a potential nuclear deal, and Trump administration insiders told Axios that the president has no desire to follow Israel into a wider war in the region. Trump had reportedly urged Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu not to carry out such a strike.\n\nThe White House has yet to respond to news of the airstrikes publicly.", "summary": "The attack came as the United States and Iran are attempting to work out a new nuclear deal", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2025/06/12/israel-launches-preemptive-strike-against-iran/", "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/05/benjamin_netanyahu_2151059968.jpg ?>", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 00:45:22", "author": "Alex Galbraith", "authors": ["Alex Galbraith"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.194}, {"id": 330877630, "title": "Israel carries out strikes against Iran", "text": "Israel carried out strikes against Iran on Thursday evening, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces \u201claunched a preemptive, precise, combined offensive to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d the IDF wrote on X.\n\n\u201cDozens of IAF jets completed the first stage that included strikes on dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran,\u201d the IDF said just before 4 a.m. Friday morning in Jerusalem. \u201cToday, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and to the wider world.\u201d\n\nThe IDF added that Israel \u201chas no choice but to fulfill the obligation to act in defense of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so, as we have done in the past.\u201d\n\nVideos shared across social media Thursday evening showed explosions in Tehran.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday night that the U.S. is \u201cnot involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cPresident Trump and the administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal\u2019s Tony Kinnett was on the air at the time of the strike and broke the news live nationally. Watch below. \n\nThe strikes came one day after news broke that the U.S. was evacuating nonessential personnel from its Iraqi embassy along with family members of military personnel at multiple bases in the Gulf.\n\nThe State Department also ordered embassies within striking distance of Iran \u201cto convene emergency action committees (EACs) and send cables back to Washington about measures to mitigate risks,\u201d The Washington Post reported ahead of the strikes.\n\nThe U.S. has been engaged in ongoing negotiation with Iran over its nuclear program. President Donald Trump repeatedly said in recent weeks that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, and following reports of a deal that would allow for some uranium enrichment to continue in Iran, Trump said any deal with Iran will ban all enrichment. But Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi said there would be no deal if Iran was not allowed to continue enrichment.\n\nIran has been enriching uranium far beyond levels needed for civilian use.\n\nWhile Iran is likely to respond to the preemptive strike from Israel, war is not necessarily imminent, according to Heritage Foundation national security experts Victoria Coates and Robert Greenway.\n\nA broader conflict in the region in response to a strike is a \u201clegitimate concern,\u201d Coates and Greenway wrote in a recent report, but \u201cit is by no means the inevitable outcome of an action targeted at Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. In fact, history indicates that limited strikes on rogue nuclear programs do not result in war: in 1981 and 2007, for example, Israel executed successful targeted strikes on both Iraq\u2019s and Syria\u2019s nuclear programs without igniting regional conflicts.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s first administration, Coates served as deputy national security advisor to and Greenway as deputy assistant to the president and senior director on the National Security Council.\n\n\u201cThe administration maintains its position that Iran cannot enrich uranium, while the regime plays for time,\u201d Coates and Greenway said Thursday.\n\n\u201cFollowing a National Security Council meeting over the weekend, the administration took pre-emptive steps to prepare for a potential kinetic action against Iran,\u201d the experts said, adding the \u201cplanned sixth round of talks are still scheduled for this weekend in Oman.\u201d\n\nThis is a breaking news story and it may be updated.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal.]", "summary": "'Dozens' of military targets, 'including nuclear targets' hit", "url": "https://www.wnd.com/2025/06/israel-carries-out-strikes-against-iran/", "image": "https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061225israeliranscreenshot.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 01:34:19", "author": "The Daily Signal", "authors": ["The Daily Signal"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.101}, {"id": 330888522, "title": "Marco Rubio Confirms U.S. Not Involved in Israel's Strikes Against Iran", "text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in response to Israel launching strikes against Iran, and confirmed that the United States is \u201cnot involved in\u201d the strikes.\n\n\u201cTonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.

This morning, the IDF began preemptive and precise strikes, targeting the Iranian nuclear program in order to prevent the Iranian regime\u2019s ability to build a nuclear bomb in the immediate time frame.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that Trump had stated earlier on Thursday that he did not want Israel to launch an attack on Iran if a possible deal could be reached with Iran regarding its nuclear program:\n\nFox News\u2019s Peter Doocy asked Trump if he was trying to talk Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu out of potentially preparing for a possible attack on Iran, or if he was okay with it.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a very fair question. Look, I want to have an agreement with Iran \u2026 We\u2019re fairly close to a pretty good agreement. It\u2019s got to be better than pretty good, though \u2026 I\u2019d much prefer an agreement,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBreitbart News also reported that the U.S. was evacuating some diplomatic staff from the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, and the family members and dependents of U.S. diplomats in Bahrain would also be allowed to evacuate.", "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in response to Israel launching strikes against Iran, and confirmed that the United States is \"not involved in\" the strikes.\n\n\nThe post Marco Rubio Confirms U.S. Not Involved in Israel&#8217;s Strikes Against Iran appeared first on Breitbart.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/06/12/marco-rubio-u-s-not-involved-israel-strikes-iran/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/sec-state-marco-rubio-june-3-2025-gettyimages-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 02:06:51", "author": "Elizabeth Weibel", "authors": ["Elizabeth Weibel"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.092}, {"id": 331069030, "title": "Israel's UN ambassador on what prompted airstrikes against Iran", "text": "Israel's UN ambassador on what prompted airstrikes against Iran NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon about his country's strikes.\n\n Middle East\n\n Israel's UN ambassador on what prompted airstrikes against Iran\n\n June 13, 20258:04 AM ET\n\n Heard on Morning Edition\n\n Steve Inskeep\n\n ISRAEL EXPLAINS STRIKE\n\n NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon about his country's strikes.", "summary": "NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon about his country's strikes.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5432480/israels-un-ambassador-on-what-prompted-airstrikes-against-iran", "image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 12:04:56", "author": "Steve Inskeep", "authors": ["Steve Inskeep"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.552}]}, {"news": [{"id": 330882332, "title": "Hurdle hints and answers for June 13, 2025", "text": "If you like playing daily word games like Wordle, then Hurdle is a great game to add to your routine.

I admire their relentless tenacity and bravery despite their diminutive stature, which comes from their original purpose when they were bred to catch rabbits.\nAnyway, I digress. Easy pickings today. My only struggle was that HOOCH and TOTO were the only famous dogs I recognized, but guesswork helped me get the DOGS OF THE SCREEN group with one guess.

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.\nIt's playable for free via the NYT Games site on desktop or mobile.\n\nNYT Connections\n\nContributor\n\nJohnny is a freelance pop culture journalist who has been writing about the internet, music, football and famous people since the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye.

You can find them here:\n\nForbesNYT \u2018Connections\u2019 Hints For Friday, June 13: Clues And Answers For Today\u2019s GameBy Kris Holt\n\nIt\u2019s a rather tough day for our Connections weekend slot, which has at least two categories that are probably going to get you in some amount of trouble. Let\u2019s go through some clues and answers to help you along the way.\n\nHow to Play Connections\n\nConnections is the second-most popular NYT Games puzzle game outside of the main crossword itself, and an extremely fun, free offering that will get your brain moving every day. Play it right here.\n\nThe goal is to take a group of 16 words and find links between four pairs of four of them. They could be specific categories of terms, or they could be little world puzzles where words may come before or after them you need to figure out. And they get more complicated from there.\n\nThere is only one set of right answers for this, and you only get a certain number of tries so you can\u2019t just spam around until you find something. There are difficulty tiers coded by color, which will usually go from yellow, blue/green to purple as difficulty increases, so know that going in and when you start linking them together.\n\nPlay Puzzles & Games on Forbes\n\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes\u2122\n\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\n\nPinpoint By Linkedin\n\nGuess The Category\n\nQueens By Linkedin\n\nCrown Each Region\n\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\n\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\n\nYou pick the four words you think are linked and either you will get a solve and a lit up row that shows you how you were connected. If you\u2019re close, it will tell you that you\u2019re one away. Again, four mistakes you lose, but if you want to know the answers without failing, either come here, or delete your web cookies and try again. If you want to play more puzzles, you can get an NYT Games subscription to access the full archives of all past puzzles. So, onto the hints and answers:\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Hints?\n\nThese are the hints that are laid out on the puzzle board itself, but after that, we will get into spoiler territory with some hints and eventually the answers.\n\nThe hints for the Connections groups today are:\n\nYellow Group - Royal Praise\n\nBlue Group - Fictional Best Friends\n\nGreen Group - A Permanent Tribute\n\nPurple Group - A Blank Pup\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Groups?\n\nAlright, the full spoilers follow here as we get into what the groups are today:\n\nYellow Group - Goddess\n\nBlue Group - Dogs of the Screen\n\nGreen Group - Elements of a Classic \u201cMom\u201d Tattoo\n\nPurple Group - _____ Terrier\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Answers?\n\nThe full-on answers are below for each group, finally inserting the four words in each category. Spoilers follow if you do not want to get this far. The Connections answers are:\n\nYellow Group - Goddess (DIVA, ICON, LEGEND, QUEEN)\n\nBlue Group - Dogs of the Screen (ASTRO, BLUE, HOOCH, TOTO)\n\nGreen Group - Elements of a Classic \u201cMom\u201d Tattoo (ARROW, HEART, MOM, RIBBON)\n\nPurple Group - _____ Terrier (BORDER, BOSTON, BULL, RAT)\n\nConnections\n\nI thought that Yellow Group was pretty easy this time, though maybe I spend too much time online where my For You pages are full of people calling Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift or what have you one of these things, and then other people arguing that they are not one of those things. It\u2019s a bit exhausting.\n\nBlue Group was not bad between Hooch and Toto, I caught on pretty quick. I mean Hooch is either booze, which no other clues match, or the dog. I did not know what dog Blue was until I figured out oh, Blue\u2019s Clues, of course.\n\nGreen Group got me. I have not seen a classic \u201cmom\u201d tattoo anywhere but on TV or in movies, and I thought this was some sort of Valentine\u2019s/Mother\u2019s Day thing. Close, but not quite. Here\u2019s the combination:\n\nA lot of other ones I found did not have any arrows, however.\n\nPurple group? Tough. It\u2019s one of those things in hindsight that makes sense, but in the moment, it\u2019s hard to group them even if you know it\u2019s some sort of \u201cblank\u201d clue. I didn\u2019t know there was such a thing as a Border Terrier as I thought there were only Border Collies. My mistake.\n\nWhich ones stumped you today?\n\non TwitterYouTube, Bluesky Instagram\n\nHerokiller series The Earthborn Trilogy.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions", "summary": "Looking for some help with today's NYT Connections?

Some associate this day with bad luck.\n\nOf course, luck \u2014 or at least randomness \u2014 is a part of life. We can\u2019t control everything.\n\nBut, at least to some degree, we make our own luck.\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying, known as the serenity prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\n\nBut I like the new twist that I first saw in the most recent years, attributed to Angela Y. Davis: \u201cI am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.\u201d\n\nOf course, most of us, acting alone, cannot change much.\n\nBut, acting together, we can change a lot.\n\nContact your reps and your senators \u2013 especially if they are GOP \u2013 and complain about that damned budget bill for billionaires.\n\nIf you can, attend a No Kings rally on Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us. We are the story now. \n\nCome on in, friends, and see how many of us are making this story better.\n\nNote: I put most of this together before what happened to Senator Padilla. That was bad, but it was also theatrics designed to make us look in a different direction. There are many stories tRump is trying to hide, and the biggest one is about us.\n\nRegular Scheduled Programming\n\nNo one here is na\u00efve; we are aware of the many who are fighting to destroy our country. Some of us expected it: the cheating, the lying, and the chaos. But we are here to read the efforts and the positive results of those (including us and our fellow gnus) who are working so hard to save our country and the planet from those very bad people. We are furious with them for what they are doing and we are letting them know.\n\n\ud83d\udc9cAlthough they lie all the time, reality matters. And our goals \u2014 based on reality \u2014 are more popular.\n\n\ud83d\udc99 They want us to be demoralized. The best way to keep up your spirits is to fight. So, take the time to recharge your batteries, make sure to protect yourself, your family and your friends, but find ways to contribute to the well-being of our country and our world.\n\n\ud83d\uddfd Reports on Resisters \ud83d\uddfd\n\nIn her opening monologue from Monday (June 9), Maddow points out that the most important story is how we respond:\n\nDon\u2019t want to watch? Here are some of the highlights (I wish they still did transcripts).\n\n No question about what this president is trying to do. The question is, will he succeed? And the answer will not be found by looking at him. It\u2019s by seeing what we do. The question is, what will this country allow him to do.\n The answer is what happens in the streets, the courts, the states, and Congress.\n We are seeing over and over again, is that protesting against him works. He wants to seem strong, but he is weak. Protesting works, courts work, pushback works.\n Marcelo (high school kid in MA), Carol (restaurant worker in MO), little girl with health issues is here, Antonio is still here\n Pushback doesn\u2019t always work, but pushback is the only thing that ever does work\n She shows protests against ICE around the country, and says tRump is panicking\n Protests also put steel in the spine of the political opposition (e.g., the Dems). Shows Governor Newsom, Representative Maxine Waters\n Maddow argues that the forces sent to intimidate Los Angeles and other places are symptoms of weakness \u2014 a president who doesn\u2019t know how to get the support of his people\n\nSo, my friends, keep on protesting.\n\nAnd especially you can protest tomorrow!\n\nNeed ideas for making a sign? How about\n\n No masks on ICE\n Budget for people not billionaires\n Tax the Rich\n Save Democracy\n Truth Matters! Love Matters!\n\nAlready got your sign? Tell us about it!\n\n\ud83d\udca3 Republicans: Party of Crimes and Chaos \ud83d\udca3\n\nUnpopular! That\u2019s one of our tools. And it helps a lot:\n\nNote it says \u201ctoday\u201d but it is from Wednesday. Sorry about the Boebert comment.\n\nAnd some off the cuff analysis:\n\nTACO! TACO! TACO! tRump surrenders on deportation:\n\nIn case you don\u2019t want to watch, tRump said, because of pushback from farmers and other employers, ICE is going to stop going after the hardworking undocumented.

Surprise, surprise!\n\nIt\u2019s important to fan the flames of division in the Rs.\n\nGeorge Conway on how tRump turns on allies Alex Henderson AlterNet\n\nDuring Donald Trump's first presidency, he was on very friendly terms with the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal group, and its activist, Leonard Leo. All three of Trump's U.S. Supreme Court appointees \u2014 Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 were people the Federalist Society aggressively promoted. And many of Trump's appointees to the lower federal courts were endorsed by the Federalist Society as well.\n\nBut Trump, now four and one-half months into his second presidency, is angrily railing against the Federalist Society and called Leo a \"sleazebag\" and a \"bad person\" on his Truth Social platform. :scissors:\n\nThe fact that Trump now hates the Federalist Society after working with them in the past, according to Conway, underscores his \"narcissistic\" personality.\n\nConway told host Sarah Longwell \u2014 who, like him, is very much a Never Trumper and rooted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election \u2014 \"Remember Mary Trump's book?.... The title was 'Too Much and Never Enough.' You can never satisfy this narcissistic appetite of Donald Trump. Because there will always be something else that he'll want from you that you can't give him or won't give him. And then, he'll turn on you.\"\n\nNote: This is why no one should ever give him an inch. Won\u2019t ever be satisfied.\n\ntRump\u2019s paranoia could be bad news for Vance Alia Zehra AlterNet\n\nTrump's decision to select Vance as his vice president, Wolff noted, was influenced by Musk \u2014 who allegedly tied his substantial financial support to Vance\u2019s nomination.\n\nIn a post on the social platform X following Musk's attacks against Trump last week, Vance said: \u201cI\u2019m the vice president to President Trump. My loyalties are always going to be with the president.\u201d\n\nBut Wolff said it\u2019s unclear whether Vance\u2019s statement that he stands with the president will be enough to earn Trump\u2019s trust following this fallout.\n\n\ud83d\ude9a \ud83d\udc99 Democrats Deliver \ud83d\udc99 \ud83d\ude9a\n\nSome inspiration: Governor Newsom has been speaking up.

We also honor those who protect the truth tellers. One of those groups is Whistleblower Aid. \n\nWant to know more? Here\u2019s a description by Allison Gill, the founder of Mueller She Wrote, and currently the podcaster hosting The Daily Beans. \n\nHey everybody, it\u2019s AG, and I'm super excited to announce our partnership with Whistleblower Aid. These are the lawyers that go up against the government to protect those willing to speak out, and they do this work pro bono!\n\nAnd they have a track record. Remember that in the first Trump administration, Whistleblower Aid successfully and safely empowered truth-tellers to stand up and protect democratic values, resulting in Trump's first impeachment as well as accountability for intelligence officers and others working to keep the Capitol safe on January 6. They are representing our good friend and fellow whistleblower, Miles Taylor, and are currently supporting several other Trump Administration whistleblowers we can\u2019t even talk about because whistleblower aid cares about protecting the identities of those who want to speak truth to power anonymously!\n\nThese are David and Goliath cases that Whistleblower Aid takes on, again at no cost to those they represent, which is why they need our help. If you can give any amount, no matter how small, you can feel good about helping these incredible attorneys protect and defend the brave folks who want to speak out in the public interest and in defense of democracy.\n\nHere\u2019s the case from the website about how they are representing Miles Taylor against the retaliation from the current evil regime (If you don\u2019t recall, Miles Taylor was the guy who wrote Anonymous during the first evil regime):\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 3, 2025 \u2013 Miles Taylor, former President Trump-appointed Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Whistleblower Aid client, filed a complaint against the Trump Administration today, calling on federal watchdogs to investigate Trump\u2019s retaliation against him. In April, Trump issued an Executive Order explicitly targeting Taylor for investigation for a litany of alleged serious crimes, including treason. This is the first time in U.S. history that a President has invoked investigative powers against a named private citizen.\n\nIn response to Miles\u2019s complaint, Whistleblower Aid CEO, Libby Liu, issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cMiles\u2019s bravery in filing this complaint represents a major step in fighting back against President Trump\u2019s weaponization of presidential power to punish those who disclose wrongdoing. Trump\u2019s labeling of Miles as a \u2018traitor\u2019 and his issuance of an unprecedented Executive Order that invokes the full investigative weight of the U.S. government against a named, private citizen, is as unconstitutional as it is autocratic. Retaliation has no place in the democratic process, and the Trump administration\u2019s revenge against whistleblowers, like Miles, is ripped right out of the authoritarian playbook. President Trump\u2019s disregard of our Constitution \u2013 which he has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend \u2013 threatens the very fabric of our Republic.\n\n\ud83c\udf39 Let\u2019s Celebrate Love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAs this Sunday is Father\u2019s Day, this week we celebrate Dads showing love: Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nFrom paying off their child\u2019s credit card debt to donating a kidney, a new survey revealed some of the most life-changing \u2018dad acts\u2019 in honor of Father\u2019s Day.\n\nThe survey of 2,000 Americans uncovered fatherhood stories showing they truly are the most helpful heroes, with people sharing stories of selflessness and kindness.\n\nOne respondent shared, \u201cThe most heroic thing my father has ever done for me was during Hurricane Harvey\u2014he trudged through the waters to come get me.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcceOdds & Ends \ud83d\udcce\n\nGlobal investment in clean energy soaring Cristen Hemingway Jaynes EcoWatch\n\nAn increase in spending on clean energy is expected to drive record global energy investment of 3.3 trillion in 2025, with 2.2 trillion of that in \u201cclean-energy technologies,\u201d according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nDespite economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, the World Energy Investment 2025 report shows China leads the way as the largest investor in energy.\n\nClean energy technologies will attract twice the capital of fossil fuels, with more investment being made in solar PV than in any other technology, the report said.\n\n\u201cAmid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record $3.3 trillion as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,\u201d said Executive Director of the IEA Fatih Birol in a press release from the intergovernmental organization. \u201cThe fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.\u201d\n\nFar fewer girls being aborted these days The Economist\n\nWithout fanfare, something remarkable has happened. The noxious practice of aborting girls simply for being girls has become dramatically less common. It first became widespread in the late 1980s, as cheap ultrasound machines made it easy to determine the sex of a fetus. Parents who were desperate for a boy but did not want a large family\u2014or, in China, were not allowed one\u2014started routinely terminating females. Globally, among babies born in 2000, a staggering 1.6m girls were missing from the number you would expect, given the natural sex ratio at birth. This year that number is likely to be 200,000\u2014and it is still falling.\n\nNote: not perfect yet, and in some places still terrible.

More out on June 13 by Israel in Iran, according to non-exhaustive data reported by the ISW, as of June 13 at 1525 GMT (Graphic by Valentina BRESCHI and Sylvie HUSSON / AFP) (Graphic by VALENTINA BRESCHI,SYLVIE HUSSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nThis morning the world woke to the kind of news that rattles the oil markets. In the early hours of June 13, Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, reportedly hitting nuclear sites and killing several senior military officials, including Hossein Salami, head of the Revolutionary Guard. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a \u201cstrategic action\u201d aimed at neutralizing what he described as existential threats.\n\nThe reaction in the oil markets was swift. Brent crude jumped nearly 8%, briefly topping $78.50, and West Texas Intermediate wasn\u2019t far behind, up over 7%. This sharp reaction occurred even though there\u2019s no evidence any oil infrastructure was targeted. But when military conflict suddenly flares up with one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers\u2014and they also happen to control the Strait of Hormuz\u2014the market pays attention.\n\nWhy This Moment Matters\n\nTo really grasp the significance, you have to look at the bigger picture. Of course, the tension between Israel and Iran isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s been simmering for decades, fed by ideology, strategic rivalry, and deep mistrust. Israel views the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat. On the flip side, Iran has long backed groups that oppose Israel, both politically and militarily, across the region.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the two countries have clashed, either\u2014most often through cyberattacks, sabotage, and a network of proxy battles stretching from Lebanon to Iraq to Syria. What\u2019s changed is the move from mostly covert operations to overt military confrontation between two countries in the world\u2019s most important oil-producing region.\n\nThe timing of the attack increases the market\u2019s nervousness. Since the Hamas-led attacks on Israel in October 2023 and the war in Gaza that followed, the region has been on edge. Iran has made no secret of its support for both Hamas and Hezbollah, while Israel has stepped up efforts to push back against Iranian influence. What happened Friday didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, but it also marks a serious escalation.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Confirms iPhone And Android Warning\u2014Delete All These Texts\n\nIsrael Strikes Iran\u2014U.S. Moves Military Resources In Middle East (Live Updates)\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Friday, June 13th\n\nIran\u2019s Role in the Global Energy Picture\n\nIran may not always dominate headlines, but when it comes to oil and gas, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s major players. The country holds some of the largest oil and natural gas reserves on the planet. And despite years of U.S. sanctions, it\u2019s still managing to export its crude oil.\n\nHow? A mix of official exports and not-so-official ones. A lot of barrels end up in China. Others move more quietly through middlemen in Asia. These aren\u2019t always transactions that show up in global tracking systems, but they\u2019re happening, and the volume adds up.\n\nAnalysts believe that by 2024, Iran was shipping out more than 1.5 million barrels per day. That\u2019s not small potatoes. In a market as tightly balanced as global oil, even minor shifts in supply can move prices. And Iran doesn\u2019t just sell oil, it has a major role in shaping policy. As part of OPEC+, it sits at the table with countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia, giving it influence on the global crude oil market.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get especially tense. Iran doesn\u2019t just produce oil\u2014it sits right next to the Strait of Hormuz. That narrow stretch of water handles about 20% of the world\u2019s daily oil traffic. Any hint that Iran might interfere there\u2014for example, with drone activity, military drills, or even underwater mines\u2014sends traders scrambling. It doesn\u2019t take much to spook the oil markets and send prices shooting higher.\n\nMarket Reaction: Fast and Furious\n\nWhen news like this breaks, the markets react quickly. Oil spiked almost immediately, but gold also jumped, while equities took a beating. The S&P 500 was down over 1.5% before lunchtime. The Dow dropped more than 600 points. This time it wasn\u2019t a concern over company earnings or interest rates. It was about geopolitical fear\u2014and the flight to safety that always comes with it.\n\nEnergy names shot higher, as you\u2019d expect. Shares of ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips all moved higher on the assumption that higher crude prices might stick around a while. On the other end of the spectrum, anything tied to transportation, shipping, or industrial manufacturing took a hit\u2014because when oil rises, so do input costs, and profit margins are squeezed.\n\nThe Inflation Risk\n\nThis would be a tricky moment for energy prices to spike under any circumstances. But right now, it\u2019s a potential mess. Inflation had been cooling. The Federal Reserve was inching toward a possible rate cut later this year. The market was breathing easier.\n\nNow? Not so much.\n\nOil is not just fuel\u2014it\u2019s embedded in everything. It moves food, powers planes, heats homes, and keeps production lines moving. Even a short-term rise in crude can work its way into consumer prices. And if this conflict escalates, that rise might not be short-term.\n\nThe news gives the Fed another reason to hesitate. Rate cuts just became politically and economically harder to justify.\n\nIn plain terms: if oil stays high, inflation will tick back up. If inflation ticks up, the Fed stays put. And if the Fed stays put, markets don\u2019t get the monetary easing they\u2019ve been pricing in.\n\nHistory Offers a Playbook\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen conflict in the Middle East send oil prices higher. It probably won\u2019t be the last. Go back to the Gulf War, the invasion of Iraq, or even Iran\u2019s tanker harassment back in 2019. All those events caused oil to spike\u2014until it became clear that the physical flow of oil wasn\u2019t actually disrupted. Then prices settled back down.\n\nThat might happen this time too. But it\u2019s the uncertainty that drives oil prices higher.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a proxy fight or a flashpoint involving non-state actors. It\u2019s a direct military hit by one sovereign nation on another\u2014and one of them happens to control one of the most important oil corridors in the world. The risk here isn\u2019t hypothetical. It\u2019s immediate and tangible.\n\nWhat Investors Should Keep an Eye On\n\nThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know yet, but a few key signals will tell us where things are headed:\n\nRetaliation: Iran already responded with drone strikes\u2014none of which hit their mark, according to reports. But if they target Israeli or U.S. assets more aggressively, we\u2019re in a new phase.\n\nThe Strait of Hormuz: This is the biggest wildcard. If Iran so much as threatens to disrupt that waterway, oil could jump another $10 or more, practically overnight.\n\nU.S. Involvement: The more Washington gets pulled in, the greater the risk to financial markets\u2014and the stronger the global response is likely to be.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Next Move: If crude stays above $80 or $85 per barrel for a sustained stretch, you can bet rate cut odds will start falling. The bond market will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Bigger Than a Headline\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just another Middle East skirmish. It was a serious, calculated military strike\u2014and the consequences are global. Whether this escalates or cools down over the next few days will determine how the market responds, but make no mistake: energy prices just became a frontline risk again.\n\nInvestors should expect more volatility. Rate cut optimism may have just peaked. And inflation, which was slowly retreating into the background, could be gearing up for a second act.\n\nOil is the world\u2019s most important commodity. It\u2019s a pressure gauge for global risk. And right now, that needle is climbing fast.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions", "summary": "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran pushed oil prices higher and reignited inflation fears.

The strait last effectively closed during the Iran-Iraq \"Tanker War\" in 1984, and remains a critical transit point for global oil and gas shipments, which led to a surge in the price of crude on Friday.\n\nBut the Strait of Hormuz is also key for global container trade. The ports in this region (Jebel Ali and Khor Fakkan) are transshipment hubs. The majority of cargo volumes from these ports are destined for Dubai, which has become a hub for the movement of freight with feeder services in the Persian Gulf, South Asia, and East Africa.\n\nIn a threat circular, British maritime security firm Ambrey advised companies and vessels to prepare rerouting of high-risk transits following military strikes. \"In the event of escalation, merchant vessels are advised to reconsider transiting through the Strait of Hormuz and close to Iranian waters, as well as to seek drifting locations close to friendly and protected territorial waters,\" Ambrey wrote.\n\nIt also recommended vessel owners and operators to check the affiliation of vessels as part of risk assessment to see if there is any Israel connection before their Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian/Arabian Gulf voyages. Vessels with affiliation or past affiliation with Israel have led to targeting of the ships in the past.\n\nBIMCO has advised ship owners to implement ship defense measures outlined in industry documents, report suspicious sightings to the UK's Maritime Trade Operations, reconsider current routing, and keep seafarer safety in mind, are among the recommendations it has shared with clients.\n\nLarsen said any perception of the United States' involvement will bring greater risks for ships, though so far the U.S. has limited its comments in relation to the strikes, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing Israel's actions as \"unilateral,\" and saying on Thursday night \"Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\"\n\n\"If the United States is suddenly perceived to be involved in attacks, the risk of escalation increases significantly,\" he said. \"An escalation is likely to impact freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf/Straits of Hormuz. Such an escalation could include missile attacks on ships or laying of sea mines in the Straits.\"\n\nThe US-led Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) said on Friday that the Strait of Hormuz remains open and commercial traffic continues to flow uninterrupted, and added it has \"no indications of an increased threat to the maritime environment.\" \n\nThe JMIC is urging companies to review contingency plans for routing, crew welfare, and emergency response in the event of a significant regional escalation when transiting the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Northern Arabian Sea.\n\nGreece, which has a history of Greek-owned tankers being seized by Iran, is also warning its Greek ship owners and operators to send details of their transits through the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIn an email to CNBC, data and analytics firm Kpler said it is keeping an eye on any vessel diversions, but it remains too early to detect any changes since Israel's attacks.\n\nRecent maritime safety practices in the Red Sea indicate that ship owners are wary of the region, with freight ship diversions ever since the Houthi attacks, despite the longer transit times and a 15% discount in containership fees offered by the Suez Canal to entice ocean carriers to return to previous routes. Suez Canal traffic is down 60% from pre-Houthi attack levels.\n\nThe maritime industry has been avoiding the Middle East even amid hopes of a truce and with Houthis saying they are not attacking ships, but Israel's strikes have put those hopes of a return to normal Red Sea shipping on hold. \"A large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea seem less likely, a situation which continues to have a major impact on ocean container shipping rates 18 months after Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen began attacking vessels in the region,\" said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta.\n\nInsurance on ships, cargo and crew is likely to be hiked by underwriters, according to Sand.\n\n\"The inevitable disruption and port congestion, as well as the potential for higher oil prices, would cause a spike in ocean freight container shipping rates, with carriers likely also pushing for a 'security surcharge' on these trades in the coming days,\" Sand added.", "summary": "Even if Iran does not close the Strait of Hormuz in response to Israel's attacks, much of the maritime shipping industry may stay away given the risks.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/13/how-freight-ships-preparing-for-israel-iran-strait-of-hormuz-risks.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107401897-1713281844298-gettyimages-1245881055-AA_30122022_1007291.jpeg?v=1713519290", "video": "https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M06D13/7000379418/1749824266-40245834348-hd_L.mp4", "publish_date": "2025-06-13 19:07:18", "author": "Lori Ann Larocco", "authors": ["Lori Ann Larocco"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.079}, {"id": 331180460, "title": "Israel-Iran conflict raises alarm over Strait of Hormuz.

The same night protests began, the Trump administration began weighing the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles. Protests continued into the week and federal troops were deployed, eventually reaching a point where National Guard members were briefly detaining protesters before handing them off to local law enforcement for arrest. Newsom has sharply blasted the use of the National Guard, accusing Trump of \u201cputting fuel on the fire\u201d and taking the president to court over the decision.

Gavin Newsom. \n\n The injunction came in response to a California lawsuit claiming Trump is violating bedrock American law and the constitution. However, the president\u2019s commitment of 700 Marines to the streets of L.A. is apparently unaffected.The ruling was met by an emergency appeal by the Trump administration to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals, which has now stayed the lower court\u2019s injunction until at least June 17.\n\n The back-and-forth court battle over Trump\u2019s troop deployments poses a thorny question: Can the president of the United States really unleash the military on U.S citizens?\n\n Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n Why is Trump doing this? \n\n Trump, an authoritarian, has long dreamed of using the military to counter his domestic opposition. The pretext for Trump\u2019s move is unrest following protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. ICE agents have been making provocative arrests and detentions of community members in Los Angeles, including of garment workers downtown and day laborers at an area Home Depot. \n\n These protests were largely peaceful, but in several locations, devolved into skirmishes between agitators on one side and cops, sheriff\u2019s deputies, and/or paramilitary federal agents on the other. The unrest had largely calmed over the weekend, until Trump decided to federalize units of the California National Guard and send them to the streets of L.A.\n\n How many troops has Trump sent to Los Angeles? \n\n Trump mobilized as many as 4,000 members of the California National Guard along with 700 Marines to deploy in Los Angeles. The military described the National Guard\u2019s mission as \u201cprotecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area.\u201d\n\n Is that legal? What about \u201cPosse Comitatus\u201d? \n\n The Posse Comitatus Act stands as America\u2019s legal guarantee against military occupation.\n\n Like so much of American history, passage of the Posse Comitatus Act is tarnished by racism. This law dates from the late 1870s. It was born out of backlash to Reconstruction in the South after the Civil War, at a time when former Confederates bridled under occupation by federal troops. These forces, for example, ensured access to the ballot box by Black voters. \n\n The act\u2019s passage barred the Army from being deployed in a domestic law enforcement capacity; it effectively ended Reconstruction and ushered in decades of Jim Crow segregation in the South. \n\n Over time, the law\u2019s restriction on the standing military being deployed inside the United States became bedrock U.S. law and a marker of state sovereignty. It is seen as a vital check on authoritarian abuses by a U.S. president, and it allows the military to focus on defeating foreign adversaries, leaving policework to cops. The act has been updated periodically, including as recently as 2021 to clarify that its restrictions apply even to the Space Force.\n\n (The phrase \u201cPosse Comitatus\u201d itself is Latin for \u201cpower of the county\u201d and has a complicated legacy dating back to English common law.) \n\n How did Trump justify federalizing the National Guard? \n\n National Guard forces are usually under the control of state governors. They have long played a role in responding to state-level natural disasters and public unrest. Under state control, National Guard forces are not restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. \n\n State-ordered National Guard deployments have also been controversial. In one of the darkest episodes in recent American history, National Guard troops, called up by the Governor of Ohio to crack down on protesters at Kent State in 1970, opened fire on anti-war activists, killing four and injuring nine.\n\n To federalize the National Guard, as Trump did this over the weekend, the president invoked an authority established in Title 10 of the federal code. Under that provision, the National Guard may be pressed into federal service under one of three conditions: \n\n In any of these cases, the president \u201cmay call into federal service\u201d the requisite National Guard forces to \u201crepel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws.\u201d Invocation of this provision has little case history; Richard Nixon used it to call in the National Guard to deliver mail during a postal strike in 1970.\n\n But in all cases, the statute states, orders to the National Guard \u201cshall be issued through the governors of the states\u201d \u2014 appearing to require agreement between the president and the governor, which does not exist in this case.\n\n How has California contested Trump\u2019s National Guard deployment? \n\n The state of California sued in federal court in San Francisco to block Trump\u2019s National Guard deployment as \u201cunlawful,\u201d insisting his Title 10 authority is a nonstarter in the case of the Los Angeles protests. \n\n \u201cTo put it bluntly, there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles,\u201d the lawsuit states. It describes instead common \u201ccivil unrest\u201d that should be handled by \u201cstate and local authorities.\u201d The lawsuit underscores that Gov. Newsom was not a party to Trump\u2019s decision to federalize the National Guard: \u201cThe governor never issued such an order or gave consent.\u201dCalifornia is making the case that troops under Trump\u2019s command are already unlawfully integrated into a policing function. \u201cMilitary forces are pervasively intertwined with civilian law enforcement activities,\u201d the latest update to suit argues. \u201cArmed troops are working side by side with ICE agents in conducting arrests and raids in the streets, homes, and workplaces of Los Angeles.\u201dIn the court of public opinion, the state is highlighting past comments by Trump and members of his cabinet to argue that administration officials know what they\u2019re doing is illegal. A post on the governor\u2019s website, calls back to Trump\u2019s comments during the 2020 federal incursion into downtown Portland, Oregon. \u201cWe have to go by the laws,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe can\u2019t call in the National Guard, unless we are requested by a governor.\u201d\n\n Likewise Kristi Noem, Trump\u2019s Homeland Security Secretary, said in 2024 as governor of South Dakota that a president seizing control of National Guard forces would be an unacceptable affront: \u201cIf Joe Biden federalizes the National Guard,\u201d she said, \u201cthat would be a direct attack on states\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\n What did the federal district judge decide? \n\n In deciding to impose an injunction, Judge Breyer wrote that California had \u201cshown a likelihood of prevailing\u201d on their argument that Trump\u2019s federalization of the National Guard was \u201cnot in fact not lawful, both exceeding the scope of his authority and violating the Tenth Amendment.\u201d (The judge leaned hard on the that amendment which reserves many powers for the states: \u201cIt is well-established that the police power is one of the quintessential powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment,\u201d he wrote.)\n\n Breyer recognized that the Trump administration has an \u201c\u201cinterest in protecting federal agents and property\u201d but insisted that the \u201cthe citizens of Los Angeles face a greater harm from the continued unlawful militarization of their city.\u201d He added that the state faces harm of being deprived of \u201cthousands of National Guard members to fight fires, combat the fentanyl trade, and perform other critical functions.\u201d \n\n The judge underscored as well that that Trump\u2019s troop deployment threatens to \u201cchill legitimate First Amendment expression.\u201d He wrote that he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the administration\u2019s stance that \u201cprotest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.\u201d\n\n The temporary injunction forbids Trump from calling up the National Guard and directs Trump to return control over these forces to Newsom.\n\n Is that order being carried out? \n\n The ruling by the district judge was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which quickly stayed the injunction Thursday, pending a hearing Tuesday, June 17.\n\n What about Trump\u2019s decision to deploy Marines? \n\n It is unclear what authority Trump has invoked to deploy active duty Marines to Los Angeles. A statement by U.S. Northern Command says the Marines\u2019 mission is to \u201cseamlessly integrate with the Title 10 forces\u201d \u2014 i.e. the National Guard troops.\n\n The state of California lawsuit claims the Marine mobilization is a violation of Posse Comitatus. (It also argued that using federalized National Guard troops as military police violates that act.)The suit reads, in part: \u201cThe Marine Corps\u2019 deployment for law enforcement purposes is\u2026 unlawful. For more than a century, the Posse Comitatus Act has expressly prohibited the use of the active duty armed forces and federalized national guard for civilian law enforcement.\u201d \n\n The judge in San Francisco did not make any ruling as to the Posse Comitatus Act arguments \u201cat this early moment in the litigation,\u201d explaining that both parties would soon have an opportunity to make their arguments in court.\n\n What about the Insurrection Act? \n\n The nativist Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller has been posting incessantly on X about the unrest in Los Angeles as an \u201cinsurrection.\u201d Trump has also called protesters \u201cinsurrectionists.\u201dThis over-the-top rhetoric has dangerous implications. \n\n The president has a trump card he can play if he seeks to expand this foray into martial law. That is the Insurrection Act. This law gives the president authority to side-step the restrictions of Posse Comitatus and to direct active duty military to suppress insurrection, domestic violence, and even \u201cunlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages.\u201d \n\n The act was pieced together from 1792 to 1871, and the liberal Brennan Center for Justice describes it as so \u201cpoorly\u201d crafted and \u201cbafflingly broad\u201d as to \u201cleave virtually everything up to the discretion of the president.\u201d\n\n The law is contradictory. Some provisions require the participation of the governor and/or legislature in the target state. Other parts give the president sole decision-making power. \n\n The Insurrection Act has been used both ways. It was famously invoked by President Dwight Eisenhower to enforce desegregation in the South after the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Its most recent use was in Los Angeles in 1992, by President George H.W. Bush, during the Rodney King riots \u2014 a move requested by the state. Lyndon B. Johnson was the last president to invoke it against the wishes of a governor, sending in troops to protect Civil Rights marchers in segregationist Alabama in 1965.\n\n Trump has been coy so far about his intentions, saying of the act from the Oval Office this week: \u201cIf there\u2019s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n What would that mean for democracy? \n\n Under Trump, any invocation of the Insurrection Act would mark a dangerous step on a path toward dictatorship. In theory, the law only empowers the president to use federal military might to support local law enforcement, or ensure that the constitutional rights of citizens are defended, not to implement martial law. \n\n In practice, Trump was given near-kingly authorities last year by the Supreme Court in its immunity decision that shields the president from criminal prosecution. His administration has threatened to arrest Gov. Newsom, and even handcuffed one of the state\u2019s U.S. Senators, Alex Padilla, when he attempted to ask Noem a question during a press conference, during which the Homeland Security secretary proclaimed that the federal government was on a mission to \u201cliberate\u201d Los Angeles, from the \u201csocialist\u201d leadership of its mayor and governor.Trump does not see himself bound by any precedent or legal norm. And he is plainly not grounded in reality, rather in delusions of grandeur. In posts on Truth Social, Trump has written of his militarization as an effort to \u201cliberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion.\u201d On Wednesday he doubled down, adding: \u201cIf our troops didn\u2019t go into Los Angeles, it would be burning to the ground right now.\u201d", "summary": "A judge attempted to block Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops, but Trump has more soldiers, and darker options", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-troop-deployment-los-angeles-is-it-legal-1235364017/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/is-trumps-troop-deployment-in-LA-legal.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 14:30:00", "author": "Andrew Perez,Tim Dickinson", "authors": ["Andrew Perez", "Tim Dickinson"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.055}, {"id": 331196416, "title": "BREAKING: Judge rules Trump\u2019s Guard deployment in Los Angeles is illegal", "text": "A federal judge has ordered President Donald Trump to relinquish control of California\u2019s National Guard troops, ruling that the president\u2019s deployment to Los Angeles amid immigration protests was illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nThe civil unrest accompanying those protests fall \u201cfar short of \u2018rebellion,\u201d U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled, concluding that Trump\u2019s attempt to equate the \u201csporadic\u201d violence over the weekend to an organized uprising were specious.

The scene in question is pivotal to both the 2010 animated original and the new film, and features Hiccup (Mason Thames) and his beloved Night Fury dragon, Toothless, learning to fly together. Set to John Powell's iconic score, the two take their first, full, successful flight, soaring through the sea and skies and cementing their lasting friendship once and for all. (Hey, we're not crying, you're crying!)\n\n Ahead, writer-director Dean DeBlois breaks down exactly how he brought the epic moment to life in all of its live-action glory.\n\n Assembling the team \n\n \"Well, it started with a phone call from Universal talking about how they were thinking of kicking the tires on an idea of revisiting How to Train Your Dragon, re-imagining it, and that first conversation was really about the dragons,\" DeBlois recalls.\n\n \"How are we going to sell that with human actors on screen in built sets and shooting on location?\" he adds. \"How could we really blend them in and not lose the personalities and the traits that define them?\"\n\n The \"real first step,\" then, was to do a lot of concept design work with visual effects company Framestore; visual effects supervisor, Christian Manz; and animation supervisor, Glen McIntosh, who comes from George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic and Jurassic Park fame. \"He was bringing that kind of paleontology and study of large animal movement to the wonderful whimsical character creation that Framestore is really known for,\" DeBlois says of McIntosh.\n\n Hatching the dragons \n\n From there, they had to bring the dragons to life, with special emphasis on Toothless, of course. \"Right from the start, we were looking at the animated movie and talking about the animal references that we had for each specific dragon, which kind of defined who they were in terms of temperament, but also in terms of design,\" DeBlois says.\n\n For example, Astrid's dragon, a Deadly Nadder, is based on tropical birds, so it's curious, moves fast, and sports vivid colors. Whereas the Gronckle, Fishlegs' dragon, \"might be a little bit more lazy and walrus or hippo-like, and equally temperamental, but a lot more lovable in his bulldog-like tendencies,\" DeBlois explains.\n\n Even in the animated films, Toothless is different than the other dragons, eschewing the more reptilian look the other beasts have. Several different species inspired the fan-favorite, but DeBlois cites a black panther as the main inspiration for his overall aesthetic. This created a challenge when bringing him to life in live-action, though.\n\n \"As we started experimenting and we were taking those giant eyes and shrinking them down to something that might be more believable in the real world, with every little increment we lost more and more of Toothless,\" DeBlois says, admitting the process was \"a lot of trial and error in the beginning.\"\n\n \"So it was all of these adjustments. It's like, okay, well I guess we need the big mouth and we need the ear plates and we need the big eyes,\" he says. \"So a lot of the work just went into getting the basics right, like the skeleton, the muscle, and the skin texture with his iridescent scales, and trying to give it a lot of credible features on top of something that we knew had to have an exaggerated expression and exaggerated facial design.\" \n\n Time to fly \n\n Creative team? Check. Star Mason Thames as Hiccup? Check. Toothless? Check. The only thing left to do? \"Then we had to figure out how are we going to make these things fly and fly with humans on their backs,\" DeBlois says. \"That was a lengthy development period where we worked with some really amazing people who build gimbals and setups for humans to ride in other movies.\"\n\n Specifically, the filmmaker says the goal was for it to feel like Hiccup is a jockey on a horse, moving in sync with the animal's movements. \"That ultimately led to the construction of this giant contraption, which is about eight or 10 feet tall, and it moves on pistons, and so it moves in six different axes according to what we need the dragon to be doing,\" he explains. But that wasn't all. \"On top of that, there was an animatronic dragon body, neck, and head that we would put a saddle on,\" DeBlois says, adding, \"when Mason would sit in the saddle and hold on, he's got these little handles that are affixed to Toothless' neck.\"\n\n The director continues, \"Mason would actually move along with whatever we did, because we could control it remotely and on the spot, whether the dragon was ascending, or banking, or rolling, all of those movements would affect Mason. So he was moving with the dragon. He wasn't just sitting in a saddle and being shifted around a little bit, as we've seen in some other productions. The idea was to make it really feel like they were symbiotic and they were partners in flying.\"\n\n Want more movie news?

It was his mom's idea to play the film's score, by returning composer John Powell, on set for Thames to listen to while they filmed it.\n\n \"So during that scene, I'm listening to the music, and it's absolutely insane,\" he says. \"That helped tremendously because in the grand scheme of it, I'm on a gimbal with a bunch of blue screens with hair dryers blowing in my face, trying to look cool on a dragon.\"\n\n Even still, while he admits that \"it was such a special moment filming\" that scene as a whole, he still didn't know exactly what to expect when he watched the final product for the first time. \"You never know what it's going to look like. I had no clue whatsoever, but after I saw the film and saw that scene, it just blew my mind. For me, I was working with something that was not there, and to see a dragon, and it looked so real \u2014 it was crazy.\"\n\n We're not in Westeros anymore \n\n As for actually shooting the big flight sequence (or indeed any of the film's many dragon flights), DeBlois says an indoor blue screen was used. However, he adds, \"We were very precise with the shots, having previsualization done of each shot, so we knew exactly what the camera was going to have to do and what the rider would be doing.\"\n\n Shots involving water were done in an underwater tank at London's famous Pinewood Studios. All of this, however, was in contrast to the bulk of the film, which was shot in and around Belfast, Ireland. Specifically at Titanic Studios, on the same site as another famous series involving dragons \u2014 Game of Thrones. \"When we first arrived, King's Landing was still standing in the back lot and we're like, 'Get this out of here,'\" DeBlois says, laughing.\n\n Though the flight sequences called for blue screen sets and VFX magic, DeBlois, who was co-director or director on all three of the animated originals, is overjoyed to tell us how lovingly and painstakingly created the sets were for everything else, from the village of Berk, to the dragon-training arena, to the interior and exterior of the Chief's house, or the marina, and Berk's Great Hall.\n\n All in a day\u2019s work \n\n Seeing everything \u2014 especially the magical Toothless and Hiccup flight \u2014 come together was \"such an exciting process\" and surpassed DeBlois' wildest dreams, he says. \"It did not disappoint. I was squealing inside,\" he says of getting the moment right.\n\n But, to be fair, he says he was \"giddy\" all the time. \"Every morning we'd show up and be freezing and everyone's drinking their coffee, and I would just walk around the sets like eyes wide, touching everything,\" he says. \"So much love was put into every detail of it, and I love that.\"\n\n And DeBlois wasn't the only one. From the very first day on set, he says, \"there was just a sense of childlike wonder\" for everyone among the cast and crew, veteran or newbie. He puts it down to an unlikely mantra he gave on day one. \"I just said that I don't know how this movie will do in theaters. I don't know how audiences will respond to it, but I can promise you that at the end of the day, it's going to be something you're proud of, and you can take your families to, and feel like it was worth all the time spent in the late nights and the weekends,\" he says. \"It is quite a sacrifice when you go into these film shoots. People work really hard, really long days, and it can weigh on you physically and in other aspects of your life, but when it's a good movie, it's all worth it.\"", "summary": "Writer-director Dean DeBlois breaks down the pivotal sequence from tip to tail.", "url": "https://ew.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-director-how-nailed-toothless-flying-scene-11753016", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/xGj8pmYvzb7-buFa2BuIx6ABtn4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-061025-c87d55a2bf5f49adbb2f57733f176494.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 19:00:00", "author": "Lauren Huff", "authors": ["Lauren Huff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.492}, {"id": 331172302, "title": "A Warning For The Live-Action \u2018How To Train Your Dragon\u2019 Post-Credits Scene", "text": "How To Train Your Dragon\nCredit: DreamWorks\n\nThe live-action remake of How To Train Your Dragon is finally here, and it\u2019s quite spectacular. My review isn\u2019t out quite yet, but I saw the movie Thursday night and I\u2019m pleased to report that it\u2019s excellent.\n\nThe film stars Mason Thames as Hiccup, Nico Parker as Astrid Hofferson, Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast and Nick Frost as Gobber. It brings back the adorable and mischievous dragon, Toothless, as well. The film was directed by Dean DeBlois who also co-wrote the screenplay.\n\nLike so many films these days, How To Train Your Dragon also includes a post-credits scene. Obviously, don\u2019t read ahead if you don\u2019t want spoilers, but take this warning spoiler-free: It is not \u2013 I repeat not \u2013 worth sticking around to watch. This is quite disappointing, but it\u2019s the only thing I was disappointed with in the movie, so that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nThe scene comes at the very, very end of the credits. There are no mid-credits scenes. You\u2019ll have to wait through several minutes of credits before the scene begins. The scene itself is just about two seconds long. All we see is Hiccup with his crude sketch of Toothless as he examines the Book of Dragons. He taps his fingers, as though thinking about something (perhaps drawing a better illustration of the Night Fury in the book). Then the scene ends.\n\nIt\u2019s quite literally nothing, just a callback to a scene we already saw earlier in the film. As far as secret scenes go, this ranks among the worst, least satisfying I\u2019ve encountered. I was hoping for something funny, or perhaps a tease for the sequel. Just about anything would have been better than this. There is no point holding your bladder or sticking around.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Confirms iPhone And Android Warning\u2014Delete All These Texts\n\nLarry Ellison $40 Billion Richer \u2014 Surpassing Bezos And Zuckerberg \u2014 As Oracle Stock Mounts Big Rally\n\nIsrael Strikes Iran\u2014U.S. Moves Military Resources In Middle East (Live Updates)\n\nOn the other hand, the rest of the movie is great and you should absolutely go see it at the movie theater.

But let\u2019s not forget, the original cast was pretty stacked.\n\nThe good news for fans of the original is that the story is largely the same, staying faithful to the animated favorite thanks to Dean DeBlois returning to write and direct. It brings fans to the Isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons battle constantly \u2014 at least until one young Viking realizes maybe they shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHere\u2019s how the live-action version compares to the animated cast.\n\nIn the original film, Hiccup was voiced by \u201cThis Is the End\u201d and \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\u201d star Jay Baruchel. In the live-action version, he\u2019s played by Mason Thames, who played Finney in \u201cThe Black Phone.\u201d Thames has also appeared in episodes of \u201cWalker\u201d and \u201cFor All Mankind.\u201d\n\nThe original Astrid was voiced by \u201cBarbie\u201d star and Oscar nominee America Ferrera. This version of Astrid is played by \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d alum Nico Parker, who also starred in Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cDumbo.\u201d\n\nGerard Butler voiced Stoick in the animated \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d and he returned for the live-action one as well, making him the only carryover between the two. Butler is of course best known for films like \u201cP.S. I Love You,\u201d \u201cThe Ugly Truth,\u201d \u201c300\u201d and many more.\n\nFormer late night host Craig Ferguson voiced the original Gobber, but here he\u2019s played by Nick Frost. You\u2019ll most likely recognize him from \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d or, more recently, Disney+\u2019s \u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d series.\n\nSnotlout is a cocky young man, determined to take credit for most accomplishments he can. He was originally voiced by \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d star Jonah Hill. In 2025, he\u2019s played by Gabriel Howell, best known for starring in \u201cNightsleeper\u201d and \u201cBodies.\u201d\n\nThe original Ruffnut \u2014 one half of a pair of goofy twins \u2014 was voiced by \u201cSNL\u201d alum Kristen Wiig. In the live-action version, she\u2019s brought to life by Bronwyn James, who most recently played Shenshen in the movie adaptation of \u201cWicked.\u201d\n\nYou likely guessed by his name that Tuffnut is Ruffnut\u2019s twin brother. He was voiced in 2010 by T.J. Miller, but is played now by Harry Trevaldwyn. He\u2019s appeared in episodes of \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d \u201cMy Lady Jane,\u201d \u201cThe Outlaws\u201d and more.\n\nFishlegs is the nerd of the group and knows a lot of dragon stats.

Instead, the scene during the end credits highlights overhead shots of some of the real-life vistas that director Dean DeBlois shot the film at.

I love everything about it, especially Toothless, because he\u2019s so cute,\" Thames says. (The original films debuted in 2010, 2014 and 2019, and each scored Oscar nominations for Best Animated Feature.)\n\n While Toothless is both a powerful and cute dragon, it's the protagonist of the How to Train Your Dragon series that Thames was most drawn to: \"Hiccup as a character, he was my hero growing up. There's so much about him that I could relate to.\"\n\n \"Especially my journey becoming an actor reminded me a lot of Hiccup,\" Thames says. \"All he wanted was to be a Viking, and in his village they looked down on him and kind of cast him out. Once [Hiccup] accepted he was different and realized he was different, that's where he truly became Hiccup. I related to him a lot.\"\n\n The Dallas, Texas, native's movie debut was in the horror film The Black Phone, in which Thames plays Finney, a teen abducted by a serial killer known colloquially as The Grabber, played by Ethan Hawke. He's also had roles in Apple TV+'s For All Mankind as well as films Monster Summer and Incoming.\n\n Thames admits acting at a young age was challenging for both himself and his parents, but he's thankful they've been \"so supportive\" of his journey thus far and \"were really proud\" when he landed the role of Hiccup.\n\n \"That was one of the best moments of my life,\" Thames says of being cast, adding that he started \"freaking out\" and \"jumped out of my chair\" when he was given the news by director Dean DeBlois, who also directed the animated films.\n\n \"I remember I went to London and I did the chemistry read and it was about two weeks or so after. I was already home and didn't hear anything. And, you know, it is what it is. I didn't think I was going to get it. I didn't think I was going to get it in the first place, and I just kind of accepted it,\" Thames recalls.\n\n What came next was an email asking Thames to hop on a call with DeBlois regarding notes for his audition. Thames initially thought he was getting rejected on the call, but instead, DeBlois said, \u201cActually, we only have one question: Would you like to play Hiccup in our movie?\u201d\n\n \"I stood up. I jumped out of my chair and broke my light,\" Thames says with a laugh. \"That was a very special moment.

I really wanted to do the fans right. Also for myself, because I\u2019m a fan. I really wanted to figure out how do I bring this character to life without changing anything everybody loves about him.\"\n\n \"When you care about movies so much and you hear that they're going to be making it in a live-action format, you get kind of nervous that it\u2019s not going to be the same, that it\u2019s going to be soulless,\" he says. \"That\u2019s something I was worried about until I met with Dean when I was in the audition process. You should see the love he has for these characters and this world and this movie. I think it really shows in the final product.\"\n\n Thames feels this latest iteration of How to Train Your Dragon will please old and new fans alike.\n\n \"The original movie is, in my opinion, a masterpiece.

A building giving way underneath in a way that cushions the impact. Aerodynamic flow that directs the fireball in other directions. The plane skin splitting like a can opener to create the perfect exit, in the perfect location, at the perfect moment. For one random dude. Swiss cheese to disaster, then reverse swiss cheese to survival, all within 30 seconds.

His case has become a rallying point for opposition to President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.\n\nFacing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., the Trump administration brought him back last week. However, he was immediately taken into custody on new criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. In court filings, prosecutors accused him of being a dangerous member of the notorious MS-13 gang, but the charges against him are only for transporting people who were in the country illegally.\n\nStill, he could face a lengthy prison sentence. He is accused of transporting hundreds of people over many years, and the maximum sentence for transporting each person is 10 years.\n\nBefore the hearing began in Nashville, Abrego Garcia's wife told a crowd outside a church that Thursday marked three months since the Trump administration \"abducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.\"\n\nSEE ALSO | Prosecutors seek pre-trial detention hearing for Abrego Garcia following his return\n\nHer voice choked with emotion, Jennifer Vasquez Sura said she saw her husband for the first time on Thursday.

The expulsion violated a 2019 U.S. immigration judge's order that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he likely faced gang persecution there.\n\nWhile the Trump administration described the mistaken removal as \"an administrative error,\" officials have continued to justify it by insisting Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. His wife and attorneys have denied the allegations, saying he's simply a construction worker and family man.\n\nTrump's administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last week to face criminal charges related to what it said was a human smuggling operation that transported immigrants across the country. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with eight passengers. His lawyers have called the allegations \"preposterous.\"\n\nU.S. attorneys have asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, describing him as a danger to the community and a flight risk. Abrego Garcia's attorneys disagree, pointing out he was already wrongly detained in a notorious Salvadoran prison thanks to government error and arguing due process and \"basic fairness\" require him to be set free.\n\nThe charges against Abrego Garcia are human smuggling. But in their request to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, U.S. attorneys also accuse him of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims, although he is not charged with such crimes.\n\nThe U.S. attorneys also accuse Abrego Garcia of taking part in a murder in El Salvador. However, none of those allegations is part of the charges against him, and at his initial appearance June 6, the judge warned prosecutors she cannot detain someone based solely on allegations.\n\nOne of Abrego Garcia's attorneys last week characterized the claims as a desperate attempt by the Trump administration to justify the mistaken deportation three months after the fact.\n\nREAD MORE | Kilmar Abrego Garcia, newly returned to US, appears in court on charges of trafficking migrants\n\n\"There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\" private attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\nIn a Wednesday court filing, Abrego Garcia's public defenders argued the government is not even entitled to a detention hearing - much less detention - because the charges against him aren't serious enough.\n\nAlthough the maximum sentence for smuggling one person is 10 years, and Abrego Garcia is accused of transporting hundreds of people over nearly a decade, his defense attorneys point out there's no minimum sentence. The average sentence for human smuggling in 2024 was just 15 months, according to court filings.\n\nThe decision to charge Abrego Garcia criminally prompted the resignation of Ben Schrader, who was chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. He posted about his departure on social media on the day of the indictment, writing, \"It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I've ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.\"\n\nHe did not directly address the indictment and declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. However, a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter confirmed the connection.\n\nAlthough Abrego Garcia lives in Maryland, he's being charged in Tennessee based on a May 2022 traffic stop for speeding in the state. The Tennessee Highway Patrol body camera video of the encounter that was released to the public last month shows a calm exchange between officers and Abrego Garcia.

The Trump administration said it will ask the judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that it followed the judge's order to return him to the U.S.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the Trump administration said that the human smuggling operation transported immigrants across the country, not that it brought immigrants into the country illegally.\n\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Va.", "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in federal court in Tennessee.", "url": "https://abc7.com/post/kilmar-abrego-garcia-hearing-today-maryland-man-deported-el-salvador-scheduled-arraigned-charges-human-smuggling/16739194/", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16681182_060625-wls-abrego-garcia-back-630pvo-vid.jpg?w=1600", "video": "https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ccg/060925-CC-ABCN-3p-Abrego-Garcia-latest-vid.mp4", "publish_date": "2025-06-13 15:42:57", "author": "Travis Loller, Jonathan Mattise And Ben Finley Associated Press", "authors": ["Travis Loller, Jonathan Mattise And Ben Finley Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.378}, {"id": 331110702, "title": "Abrego Garcia pleads not guilty to human smuggling charges", "text": "U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes presided over the arraignment in Nashville, where the court also heard arguments about whether Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally over a decade ago, should remain in custody while awaiting trial.

A fierce critic of the United States, Bagheri had been warning for years that his forces were ready for any possible military action against the country.The chief of staff of Iran's armed forces had also vowed to retaliate against Israel in response to the assassination of a Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in 2024.Bagheri had recently been overseeing major exercises focusing on electronic warfare and drone operations, emphasizing Iran's strategic shift to modern warfare capabilities.Major General Hossein SalamiAs Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), Salami was one of the voices most defiant to Israel, once saying it could be defeated with \"a single operation.\"Salami had praised Hezbollah's operations in its war with Israel in 2024, as part of a broader \"Axis of Resistance\". Salami leveled a threat to the United States last month, saying Iran would \"open the gates of hell\" if attacked by Israel or America.Major General Gholam Ali RashidBoth Rashid and his son were reported killed, according to the Tasnim News Agency. Rashid served as the commander of Iran's Khatam al\u2011Anbia Central Headquarters (KCHQ), a joint military command under the General Staff that coordinates operations between the IRGC and the regular army.Dr. Fereydoon AbbasiAbbasi was the former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), overseeing Iran's nuclear energy and enrichment activities during a period of heightened tensions with the West.A longtime member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Abbasi Davani was named specifically in a United Nations sanctions resolution as \"involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities.\"In 2010, he survived a car bomb assassination attempt in Tehran, which killed another major nuclear scientist. Iranian officials attributed the attack to Israel's intelligence services, saying it aimed to sabotage Iran's nuclear progress.Dr. Mohammad Mahdi TehranchiTehranchi was a theoretical physicist who served as President of the Islamic Azad University, which played a key role by being directly involvement in Iran's nuclear program and potetially of the development of nuclear weapons, although Iran always denied having ambitions for nuclear weapons.Other Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated in the past.

The Israel Defense Forces strikes took out Gen. Hossein Salami, the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), inflicting a significant blow to Tehran's governing theocracy. He had a history of threatening the U.S. and Israel. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, was also killed. His death further escalates the gravity of the strike and its implications for Iran\u2019s military structure. In addition to Gen. Hossein Salami and Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, at least 20 senior Iranian commanders were killed in the strikes. ISRAEL LAUNCHES 'OPERATION RISING LION' ON IRAN, TARGETING NUCLEAR FACILITIES, TEHRAN Their deaths came amid Israeli Defense Forces launched a sweeping strike on Iran, called \"Operation Rising Lion.\" It followed months of attempted, and seemingly failed, nuclear negotiations between the Trump administration and Tehran. Israel said it launched the strikes to target Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile infrastructure. Gen. Hossein Salami \u2013 Commander-in-Chief of the IRGC Salami was the commander-in-chief of the IRGC since his appointment in 2019 by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2019, overseeing Iran\u2019s elite military force. His appointment came shortly after President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization. Salami first joined the IRGC during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, rising through the ranks to lead the IRGC\u2019s air forces and later its entire command. The IRGC is one of the country\u2019s most powerful centers. It was created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution and has evolved from a paramilitary, domestic security force into a transnational force that has come to the aid of Tehran\u2019s allies in the Middle East, from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq, per the Times of Israel. It operates in parallel to the country\u2019s existing armed forces. It controls Iran\u2019s arsenal of ballistic missiles, which it has used to attack Israel twice during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. ISRAEL HITS THE \u2018HEART\u2019 OF IRAN\u2019S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN NATANZ FACILITY STRIKE Control over Iran\u2019s missile arsenal Under Salami, the IRGC evolved into a powerful transnational force, heavily involved in supporting Iran\u2019s regional allies like Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. The Guard controls Iran\u2019s ballistic missile arsenal, which has been used against Israel, especially during the Israel-Hamas war. Confrontational rhetoric Salami was known for his aggressive rhetoric against both Israel and the United States, calling for the destruction of Israel as early as 2016. In 2020, after the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC\u2019s elite Quds Force, the IRGC Quds Force commander in 2020, Salami vowed retaliation. Just five days later, Iran launched missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq. He also warned that American and Israeli commanders would be targeted in future reprisals. Launched unprecedented strike Last year, Salami ordered a massive attack of more than 300 drones and missiles in response to the Israeli killing of seven Iranian generals in Syria. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri \u2013 Chief of Staff of Iranian Armed Forces Bagheri has served as the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces since 2016, coordinating operations across the army, IRGC, and air defenses. He was a veteran of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and held multiple senior roles in intelligence and strategic command. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Intelligence power broker Bagheri was instrumental in shaping Iran\u2019s military doctrine and led efforts to modernize its missile and air defense systems. He represented Iran in military coordination with allies like Russia and Syria, particularly during joint operations in the Syrian Civil War.

Israel hit a key underground nuclear site in Natanz several times, Iranian state television said, reporting that most damage was at \"surface level\".Other key nuclear sites at Fordow and Isfahan were not immediately struck, said the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), citing Iranian authorities.Additional strikes hit sites in Iran's northwest, with eight people being killed in and near the city of Tabriz, the ISNA news agency said.The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, and the chief of staff of its armed forces, Mohammad Bagheri, were killed in Israel's wave of raids, with replacements swiftly named by supreme leader Ali Khamenei.The Revolutionary Guards said that its aerospace commander, Amirali Hajizadeh, was also killed. He was in charge of Iran's ballistic missile forces.Iranian media said several nuclear scientists were killed.State media said senior Khamenei adviser Ali Shamkhani was hurt in one of the strikes, and reported separately that civilians were killed, without providing an exact figure.The Israeli raids will \"continue as many days as it takes\", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.Iran launched some 100 drones in retaliation, according to the Israeli military, which said \"most\" were intercepted outside Israeli territory.The bigger concern is Iran's sizeable arsenal of ballistic missiles.Khamenei warned Israel faces a \"bitter and painful\" fate over the attacks. Iran's foreign minister called the Israeli attacks \"a declaration of war\" and urged UN Security Council action.Iran had previously warned it would hit US military bases in the Middle East if conflict occurred. The United States pulled out non-essential personnel from several sites days ahead of the Israeli attack.Internet restrictions were imposed across Iran, the country's communications ministry said, adding they would be lifted \"once normalcy returns\".Trump said Israel informed him of its raids ahead of time, but insisted the United States was not involved.He warned Iran that the \"next planned attacks\" will be \"even more brutal\" and said Tehran should cut a deal to roll back its nuclear programme \"before there is nothing left\".The US leader has repeatedly said he will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons.Tehran has long denied seeking atomic bombs, but had been enriching uranium to a level very close to being able to make them.The United States and Iran had been holding talks on the issue. The next round, scheduled for Sunday in Oman, now look to be cancelled.Israel, Trump said, has a huge military arsenal thanks to the United States and \"they know how to use it\".Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the United States would protect its forces in the Middle East.\"Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,\" Rubio said.The attack, and likely Iranian response, is fuelling international alarm.Many capitals were urging restraint, fearing the consequences if the Israel-Iran conflict widened and drew in the United States, and if Middle East oil production and shipments were impacted.Oil prices leapt dramatically on Friday, trading sharply up to around $75 a barrel before falling back a little.The leaders of France, Germany and Britain were to hold a call to discuss the Israeli strikes, Berlin said.

Jean Carroll, leaving the Supreme Court as Trump\u2019s only remaining pathway. \n\nA three-judge panel on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the verdict late last year. On Friday, the full active 2nd Circuit bench declined to disturb that decision, over the dissent of two judges. \n\n\u201cSimply re-litigating a case is not an appropriate use of the en banc procedure,\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge Myrna P\u00e9rez wrote, joined by three of her colleagues, all of whom were appointed by former President Biden. \n\n\u201cIn those rare instances in which a case warrants our collective consideration, it is almost always because it involves a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel\u2019s opinion and appellate precedent,\u201d P\u00e9rez added. \n\nIn 2023, the New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and defaming her by denying her story when she came forward during Trump\u2019s first presidency. The jury ordered Trump to pay $5 million. \n\nTrump, who maintains he never assaulted Carroll, argued his trial was tainted because the jury heard improper evidence, such as the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and testimony from other women who accused Trump of sexual assault. \n\nThe president also contends he should\u2019ve been able to tell jurors that a nonprofit funded by LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic mega-donor Reid Hoffman helped Carroll pay her legal fees. The president\u2019s lawyers believed it bolstered their claims that the columnist went after Trump for political reasons, but the trial judge ruled it inadmissible. \n\nTwo Trump-appointed 2nd Circuit judges, Steven Menashi and Michael Park, in dissent said Friday that the trial included a \u201cseries of indefensible evidentiary rulings.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe result was a jury verdict based on impermissible character evidence and few reliable facts. No one can have any confidence that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the normal rules of evidence had been applied,\u201d Menashi wrote. \n\nOf the 10 judges who voted, only Menashi and Park dissented. The 2nd Circuit has 13 judges in active service eligible to sit for the case, but three of them recused without explanation.\n\n\u201cThe American People are supporting President Trump in historic numbers, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed,\u201d a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s legal team said in a statement. \n\n\u201cPresident Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he is focusing on his mission to Make America Great Again.\u201d \n\nThe case was the first of two times Carroll took Trump to trial. \n\nIn Carroll\u2019s other lawsuit, another jury later ordered Trump to pay $83.3 million in defamation damages for continuing to deny her story. \n\nTrump\u2019s appeal in that case heads to a three-judge 2nd Circuit panel for oral arguments June 24.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Brewers honored Civale's request on Friday, but in grueling fashion. Civale is now headed to the Chicago White Sox, who less than nine months ago set the modern-era MLB record (since 1901) for the most losses in a single season. Chicago went 41-121 last season, just three years removed from winning 91 games and making the American League Division Series. They finished 51.0 games back of the Cleveland Guardians for first place in the division. REDS PITCHER WADE MILEY NAMED AS ONE OF TYLER SKAGGS' DRUG SUPPLIERS IN WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT Thankfully, and amazingly for them, it does not look like the record will stand for much longer. The Colorado Rockies are 13-55 (.191 winning percentage) and are on pace to finish 30-142, 11 games worse than Chicago. However, the White Sox still remain a laughingstock. They currently have twice as many losses (46) as they do victories (23) and are on pace for just 54 wins this season. In return, Milwaukee got Andrew Vaughn, who was once a highly-touted prospect. He was the third overall pick in the 2019 MLB Draft but has never lived up to the billing. His lifetime wins above replacement is -0.4, and this season, he is hitting a career-worst .189. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Civale's career started with the Cleveland Guardians organization, and in his five seasons there, he owned a 3.77 ERA. He was traded to Milwaukee from Tampa Bay last year, but in just five starts this season, he has put up an ERA of 4.91. Milwaukee sits 5.5 games behind the Chicago Cubs for the NL Central crown.

The Brewers moved quickly after they announced they were removing Civale from their rotation. The pitcher said Thursday he wanted to remain a starter even if it meant leaving Milwaukee. One day later, Civale was traded. The Brewers also are sending $807,000 to the White Sox as part of the deal. \"We\u2019re exploring opportunities for me to get back into a rotation, whether that\u2019s here or elsewhere,\" Civale said Thursday on his 30th birthday. \"That type of decision is out of my hands. We\u2019re exploring the options to give me the chance to do what I do best, and that\u2019s to go out there and start.\" Civale is 1-2 with a 4.91 ERA this season. He has allowed seven runs over 19 innings in four starts since returning from the injured list May 22 after dealing with a strained left hamstring. The Brewers took Civale out of their rotation because they had a surplus of starters after promoting prospect Jacob Misiorowski, who threw five innings of no-hit ball while helping Milwaukee beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-0 in his major league debut Thursday. Milwaukee's rotation also includes Freddy Peralta (5-4, 2.69 ERA), Jose Quintana (4-1, 2.66 ERA), Quinn Priester (4-2 3.65 ERA) and Chad Patrick (3-6, 3.25 ERA). Although Civale pitched in relief in two postseason games \u2014 one in 2022 with Cleveland and another last year in Milwaukee \u2014 all of his regular-season appearances in the major and minor leagues have come in a starting role. Civale, who is 40-37 with a 4.06 ERA in 122 career big league starts, is making $8 million this year and is eligible for free agency at the end of the season. The Brewers acquired Civale in a July trade with the Tampa Bay Rays, who got him in a 2023 trade-deadline deal with the Cleveland Guardians. Civale becomes the third former Brewer to join the White Sox in the last month. The White Sox also claimed infielder Vinny Capra off waivers from the Brewers and signed pitcher Tyler Alexander after Milwaukee designated him for assignment. The 27-year-old Vaughn, who has also made big-league starts in right and left field, hit .189 with a .218 on-base percentage, five homers and 19 RBIs in 48 games with Chicago before he was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte on May 23. He will report to the Brewers' Triple-A Nashville affiliate. He has a career average of .248 with a .303 on-base percentage, 77 homers and 293 RBIs in 610 games for the White Sox, who selected him out of the University of California with the third overall pick in the 2019 draft. In other moves Friday, the Brewers recalled right-hander Grant Anderson and outfielder Drew Avans from Triple-A Nashville. Outfielder Daz Cameron was placed on the paternity list.

The retaliatory action by Iran was long anticipated and well planned for, Defin said.Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun \"Operation Rising Lion,\" with a massive wave of airstrikes against dozens of Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders and research scientists, saying the goal was to \"roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\"Like Netanyahu, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin, in a video statement delivered Friday, called the attack on Iran preemptive, saying Israeli intelligence had uncovered an Iranian \"plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years.\" He said that plan involved Iran \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" working to double or triple its ballistic missile stockpile, and continuing to \"finance, arm, and operate its proxies throughout the Middle East against the State of Israel.\" Iranian state media said the Israeli strikes hit several cities, including the capital of Tehran and the city of Natanz, a key center for Iran's uranium enrichment program. The attacks also killed Hossein Salami, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and other senior figures, Defin said on Friday.The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said in a series of social media posts that its Director General Rafael Grossi had been in contact with Iranian authorities on Friday who told him the country's highly-sensitive and highly-secured Fordo nuclear site \"has not been impacted\" by the Israeli strikes. The IAEA also said Iran's \"Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant has not been targeted and that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.\" The IDF said its operation would continue for days, but that the first wave consisted of 200 Israeli fighter jets dropping \"over 330 different munitions,\" to hit more than 100 targets in Iran.Iranian officials quickly threatened retaliation to the attack, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Israel \"should await a harsh response.\"The IDF said in a statement before Iran's retaliatory strikes that it had prepared for \"a campaign on the frontline and on the home front.\"Netanyahu said Israel's strikes against Iran, \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"The exchange of fire between the Middle East's bitter foes quickly snarled international air travel in the region. Dubai International Airport said in a message posted on social media that some flights were \"cancelled or delayed due to airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria.\" The airport said it was \"working to manage the disruption and support affected guests,\" and urged travelers to check with their airlines for before coming to either airport. Shortly after Israel's strikes, the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place. A day beforehand, the Trump administration ordered non-emergency U.S. personnel to leave Iraq and allowed U.S. military family members to leave the Middle East voluntarily.Friday's back-and-forth could escalate to be among the most severe clash between Israel and Iran, which have been adversaries for decades. Mr. Trump warned earlier in the week that it could snowball into a \"massive\" conflict.Israel has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in recent years, while Iran has backed foes of Israel, including the militant group Hamas. In April of last year, Iran launched missiles and drones at Israel after a strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus was widely attributed to Israel, but the Israeli military intercepted the vast majority of the weapons. Six months later, Iran launched more missiles at Israel, which retaliated with strikes on Iranian sites.The Israeli strikes and Iranian counterattack came amid efforts by President Trump to strike a new deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear ambitions \u2014 an idea Israel has long been dubious of.The U.S. and Iran are still set to hold talks on Sunday, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News.

Widespread battering of Iran\u2019s proxies and allies across the Middle East, particularly Hezbollah in Iran and the Assad regime in Syria, increasingly emboldened Jerusalem, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeking to achieve his decadeslong goal of destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program with military strikes.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s warnings to the contrary, Israel executed a series of long-range strikes against Iran. The plan took over eight months to make, according to Axios, and was one of Israel\u2019s most complex operations yet.\n\nIsraeli air and missile strikes were reported against Tehran, Natanz, Iran\u2019s main uranium enrichment facility, Tabriz, Kermanshah, and Borujerd. The Israel Defense Forces reported that the attacks, code-named Operation Rising Lion, would take place over several days.\n\nThe strikes weren\u2019t only carried out by Israeli aircraft. Mossad and other Israeli intelligence operatives deployed precision weapons near Iranian missile and air defense launchers, striking them to prevent an effective response and establish freedom of movement for Israeli planes. An Israeli official said Mossad built a secret explosive drone base within Iran that was utilized for the strikes.\n\nOne of the most surprising details of the operation was its decapitation strikes, with videos and images showing damage directed against individual apartment blocks belonging to Iranian officials and persons of interest.\n\nSo far, the operation has reportedly exceeded Israel\u2019s expectations.\n\nIn one instance, Israel tricked the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019s top air force commanders into meeting at a monitored location, where they were killed in a strike.\n\n\u201cWe did specific activities to help us understand things about them and then used that information to make them act in a specific way,\u201d an Israeli security source told Fox News. \u201cWe knew this would make them meet, but more importantly, we knew how to keep them there.\u201d\n\nWho was killed in the decapitation strikes?\n\nThe IDF said its strikes hit \u201cover 100 targets, including senior figures of the Iranian General Staff and leaders of the nuclear program.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli security source told Fox News that over 20 sites, including apartments and offices, were hit in less than 15 minutes.\n\nIranian state media reported that Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Guard\u2019s missile program, senior Guard Cmdr. Gholam Ali Rashid, and Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of Iran\u2019s armed forces, were all killed in the strikes.\n\nIsrael linked the deaths of several commanders with a 2019 strike against Saudi Arabia, likely looking to elicit sympathy from the kingdom, which criticized the strikes.\n\nAmong the scientists and nuclear officials assassinated were Fereydoon Abbasi, former head of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization; Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, a major figure in Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program; Abdulhamid Minouchehr, head of nuclear engineering at Shahid Beheshti University; Ahmad Reza Zolfaghari, nuclear engineering professor at Shahid Beheshti University; and Amirhossein Feqhi, a nuclear professor at the university.\n\nIsrael assessed that many other senior commanders had also been killed, but these haven\u2019t yet been confirmed.\n\nWhat was Israel\u2019s rationale?\n\nFor decades, Israel has warned that Iran was on the verge of creating a nuclear weapon, but Israel became increasingly concerned over the past year that Iran would expedite efforts in response to its conventional deterrence being destroyed, particularly due to Hezbollah\u2019s crippling. Analysts outside of Israel backed Jerusalem\u2019s view, with the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s board of government declaring earlier this week that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation obligations for the first time.\n\nIn a Friday speech, Netanyahu presented the strikes as essential to preserving Israel\u2019s sovereignty and existence.\n\n\u201cMoments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel\u2019s very survival,\u201d he said in a televised address, adding, \u201cThis operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told our security leadership: We have no alternative but to act swiftly,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave these threats for the next generation. If we don\u2019t act now, there won\u2019t be a next generation.\u201d\n\nHe repeatedly cited the Holocaust as a reason to be vigilant against a nuclear-capable Iran.\n\n\u201cTogether, with God\u2019s help, we will ensure Israel\u2019s eternity,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nHow is Iran reacting?\n\nIran didn\u2019t launch a massive military response, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of \u201csevere punishment\u201d in a series of posts on X.\n\n\u201cIn the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful To the great Iranian nation! Zionist regime has committed a crime in our dear country today at dawn with its satanic, bloodstained hands. It has revealed its malicious nature even more than before by targeting residential areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy God\u2019s grace, the powerful arm of the Islamic Republic\u2019s Armed Forces won\u2019t let them go unpunished,\u201d Khamenei added.\n\nHe promised the swift replacement of military and scientific leaders. Gen. Sayyid Abdolrahim Mousavi was named as Bagheri\u2019s replacement as head of the armed forces, Major Gen. Mohammad Pakpour was named to replace Salami as head of the Guard, and Major Gen. Ali Shadmani was named to replace Rashid.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would \u201cstrongly take action\u201d against Israel, promising \u201ca severe, wise and strong answer to the occupier regime.\u201d\n\nIran didn\u2019t declare war against Israel in its first statements after the strikes, as had been originally suspected.\n\nThe IDF reported roughly 100 drones were launched against Israel in the aftermath, but Iran said they were launched from allied militias in Iraq.\n\nHow is the US reacting?\n\nThe U.S. sought to distance itself from the strikes, noting it was committed to diplomacy and that Israel acted unilaterally.\n\n\u201cTonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.\n\nTrump lamented that Iran hadn\u2019t made a deal with him to halt the strikes.\n\n\u201cI gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to \u2018just do it,\u2019 but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn\u2019t get it done. I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come \u2013 And they know how to use it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCertain Iranian hardliner\u2019s spoke bravely, but they didn\u2019t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse! There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter,\u201d Trump continued, adding that the next attacks were already planned and would be \u201ceven more brutal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe president also noted the strikes occurred 61 days after he proposed a 60-day deadline to Iran.\n\nHow is Russia reacting?\n\nRussia, an ally of Iran, denounced Israel\u2019s actions. Its foreign ministry said Israel violated \u201cthe Charter of the United Nations and international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnprovoked military strikes on a sovereign UN member state, its citizens and its peacefully slumbering cities, as well as its nuclear energy infrastructure, are categorically unacceptable.

A diplomatic resolution is now more urgent than ever, for the sake of the region\u2019s stability and global security,\u201d she said.\n\nJordan, Iraq, Japan, Turkey, Indonesia, and the United Nations condemned the attacks.

You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns \u2b1b\ufe0f, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. \ud83d\udfe8 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. \ud83d\udfe9 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.\nYour second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.\nAfter that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above.\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.\n\nKerry Brunskill\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nContributing Writer\n\nWhen baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the daily Wordle puzzle to give readers a hint each and every day.

Today is the only Friday the 13th we'll have in 2025, so it's a good enough reason to watch a horror movie if you enjoy that sort of thing. We definitely don't want you to be scared of losing your Wordle streak, though. To help keep it intact, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Friday's puzzle (#1,455).\n\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that too.\n\nWhat is Wordle?\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. The gist is that there is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nHow to play Wordle\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets and Discord. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nHow to play Wordle more than once a day\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,400 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nPrevious Wordle answers\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Thursday, June 12 \u2014 VIXEN\n\nWednesday, June 11 \u2014 PLAID\n\nTuesday, June 10 \u2014 TAFFY\n\nMonday, June 9 \u2014 BOARD\n\nSunday, June 8 \u2014 LEASE\n\nToday's Wordle hints explained\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly.

Sara Haines and Ana Navarro highlighted these similarities during their discussion.\n\nHaines was the first to express this viewpoint, stating, \u201cWhen I think of military parades, nations like Russia and North Korea come to mind\u2026 That\u2019s not the image I associate with the United States.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThere\u2019s also the topic of budget cuts and high costs\u2026 $40 million. Who believes it\u2019s wise to cut benefits like school lunches to fund an event that echoes World War II-era propaganda?\u201d\n\nNavarro, who shared that she is planning to \u201cpeacefully protest\u201d in Miami at a rally that coincides with the parade, added that America has never held a military parade like this. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hypocrisy. It\u2019s the fact that we never did it as America, we never had these types of parades because we are the biggest military force,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you are the biggest, the most powerful, you don\u2019t need to show off. Leave it to Kim Jong Un. Leave it for the dictators.\u201d\n\nNavarro spent some time railing against President Trump\u2019s recent spending, noting, \u201c$45 million he is spending on this parade, on top of the $135 million he\u2019s spending sending the Marines and the National Guard to California. So that\u2019s almost $200 million right there at a time when DOGE directed the VA to cancel over 800 contracts.\u201d \n\nShe added that Trump\u2019s cabinet previously kept him from throwing a military parade during his first term. \u201cBack then, he actually had adults around him in the cabinet people like four-star generals,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, he\u2019s got these sycophants who say yes to every hair-brained idea that crosses his brain.\u201d \n\nBut Joy Behar noted the parade also coincides with President Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll only be interested if Stormy Daniels will jump out of a cake,\u201d she joked before throwing it to commercial. \n\nThe View airs on weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn Friday\u2019s (June 13) episode of The View, the hosts criticized President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ana Navarro Criticizes Trump&#8217;s Military Parade on &#8216;The View&#8217;: &#8220;Save it for the Dictators&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/entertainment/ana-navarro-criticizes-trumps-military-parade-on-the-view-save-it-for-the-dictators/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scott-Wolfs-estranged-wife-appears-to-get-ARRESTED-after-shock-380x200.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 16:42:03", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.01}, {"id": 331159484, "title": "Photos: Preparations for Trump\u2019s military parade marking the 250th anniversary of the US Army", "text": "Workers install security fencing on the National Mall, Tuesday, June 10, 2025, outside the USDA Whitten Building where a large photograph of President Donald Trump is draped, in Washington.

No matter what, a historic celebration of our military servicemembers will take place!\u201d the spokeswoman said. \n\nThe parade on Saturday is set to cap a week of celebrations observing the Army\u2019s 250th birthday.

They maintain, three people familiar with the matter say, that immigration was one of Trump\u2019s strongest issues, that it helped get him back in the White House, and that his mass deportation program has polled well since the 2024 campaign.\n\n No matter the pushback to Trump sending in the troops (likely illegally) from Democrats, the media, or protesters, the administration\u2019s brain trust saw this as a winner for them \u2014 and something they wish to replicate. \u201cIf it works out well in L.A., expect it everywhere,\u201d a Trump administration official said of the president\u2019s desire for militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across the nation. (This official and the other three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.)\n\n But just days into Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to quell anti-ICE protests in L.A., new public polling suggests that Trump\u2019s recent deportation operations, and his decision to use the military against his domestic enemies, are not boosting his approval ratings.\n\n In fact, Trump\u2019s latest power grab is tanking his latest numbers.\n\n Trump\u2019s general platform of federal immigration crackdowns polled well in the build-up to his election and second term; 2024 polling showed Trump\u2019s calls for grand-scale deportations of undocumented immigrants enjoyed majority support. (However, that majority support diminished when voters were pressed on specific policies and methods.) In April of last year \u2014 to the alarm of Democratic operatives and Biden officials \u2014 a Harris Poll survey showed 42 percent of Democrats warming up to the idea.\n\n According to a polling analysis by data journalist G. Elliott Morris, Trump entered office with a strong positive approval rating on immigration. But those ratings peaked in February at a high of +11.3 percent. Now, for the second time since April, Morris\u2019 polling average shows Trump\u2019s immigration approval rating in the negatives. \n\n It appears the militarized incursion into Los Angeles is not playing well with the public at large. A recent YouGov survey shows 47 percent of American adults disapprove of Trump ordering the Marines to L.A., compared to 34 percent who support it. In the same poll, 45 percent disapprove of the president\u2019s use of National Guard troops, with 38 percent of respondents backing it.\n\n This aligns with a Wednesday Quinnipiac poll that found 54 percent of respondents disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of immigration, and that 56 percent disapprove of his handling of deportations. (This is a markedly negative turn from an April Quinnipiac poll that found only 50 percent of respondents disapproved of his handling of immigration issues.) Similarly, a Thursday AP/NORC poll found that 53 percent disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of immigration, compared to 46 percent who approve. A text survey conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University\u2019s Schar School found that the public rated Trump\u2019s immigration and deportation policies \u201cnegatively by a 15 percentage-point margin, 52 percent to 37 percent.\u201d \n\n A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday shows a stark disconnect between the public\u2019s general approval for strong action to restore order, and disapproval of what Trump is doing in Southern California. It found that 48 percent of respondents theoretically agree with the statement that the president should \u201cdeploy the military to bring order to the streets.\u201d But only 38 percent of respondents actually approved of how the president is responding to protests in Los Angeles. \n\n Those numbers are likely to continue trending downward as the Trump administration continues to behave badly in L.A. On Thursday \u2014 during a press conference in which Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declared her department would be staying in Los Angeles to \u201cliberate this city from the socialist and burdensome leadership\u201d of Democrats \u2014 Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was tackled to the ground and handcuffed by FBI agents when he attempted to ask a question of Noem.\n\n Video of Padilla\u2019s detention quickly went viral on social media. After being released without charges, the senator told reporters that \u201cif this is how DHS responds to a senator with a question you can only imagine what they\u2019re doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California.\u201d \n\n Without a doubt the videos and stories of teenagers, pregnant women, and everyday working people being chased and detained by ICE is reaffirming what polling and surveys have long showed to be true: Americans generally believe that undocumented migrants with criminal records should be deported, but they are generally put off by indiscriminate immigration raids and deportations that disregard the circumstances of the individual. \n\n There\u2019s a silver lining, perhaps, for Trump and his party in some of this data. Democrats in Congress are also wildly unpopular, driven by dissatisfaction from their own liberal voters.\n\n \u201cThe public supports keeping America safe and secure, and they don\u2019t like the concept of people here illegally \u2014 the issue is how it\u2019s administered,\u201d says Frank Luntz, a longtime pollster and a conservative Trump critic. \u201cThey have an agenda the American people support; their problem is the way they execute it and articulate it.\u201d Voters do want immigration laws enforced, he says, but they \u201cdon\u2019t want senators beaten up at press conferences. This has been the challenge of the Trump administration from the beginning,\u201d Luntz adds, \u201cbecause they think they are on the right track, but the way it\u2019s being administered right now, they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n Even the president himself \u2014 who wrote on Thursday that \u201call\u201d undocumented people \u201chave to go home\u201d \u2014 seems to be oscillating on the issue, at least from a public-relations standpoint. Earlier in the day Trump posted on Truth Social that \u201cfarmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them. This is not good,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d \n\n For the time being, however, the Trump administration is barreling ahead on its vision of his very American police state. \u201cIn November, the American people resoundingly rejected the Democrat vision for immigration \u2014 open borders and millions of unvetted illegal aliens \u2014 and endorsed President Trump\u2019s vision for immigration \u2014 deportations and enforced immigration law,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Rolling Stone. \u201cPresident Trump is keeping his promise to the American people and violent left-wing rioters won\u2019t stop that.\u201d\n\n Asked about the recent slate of negative polls for Trump on immigration, John McLaughlin, a top Trump pollster, simply replies: \u201cYou mean the fake polls?\u201d\n\n He points to rosy results for Trump in his own surveys and conservative-leaning polls: \u201cWe did a national poll for Club for Growth yesterday among 1,000 likely voters and Trump\u2019s approval was 53-44 Rasmussen Reports poll today is 53-45,\u201d McLaughlin says.", "summary": "Polls show that American voters don\u2019t seem to enjoy the threat of military occupation", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-military-crackdown-immigration-bad-poll-numbers-1235364381/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-trump-crackdown-hurts.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 19:16:13", "author": "Asawin Suebsaeng,Nikki McCann Ramirez,Tim Dickinson", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "Tim Dickinson"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.032}, {"id": 331181762, "title": "Trump\u2019s Military Parade By The Numbers", "text": "Saturday, June 14 marks the 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Army, which will be celebrated with a festival and military parade in Washington, D.C.

There won't be any meticulous save-scumming being done here, folks. Once you have used up all your time and hit the exhausted part of your energy bar, you can go to bed. You fall asleep, the game saves, and you wake up.\n\nThis is all you can do, forcing you to commit to your priorities and choices each day or reload right from the moment you get out of bed, should you need to for any reason. As a game, The Alters definitely wants you to stick to your choices, see how they all play out, and then try different options on another run. It's a core part of the design, especially for the narrative. \n\nSo, there you have it. I will admit that this type of saving system is just a little annoying when you suddenly have to go and do something and want to save your game, but the menu screen will pause time, allowing you to take care of your cats, kids, or anyone else who needs attention while you are trying to mine those precious metals.\n\nMake sure you stay with Shacknews for more guides and news about The Alters.", "summary": "Nothing worse than losing your progress.", "url": "https://www.shacknews.com/article/144657/how-to-save-the-alters", "image": "https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2025/06/13/the-alters-screenshot-20250607-20431549_feature.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 13:13:22", "author": "Aidan O'brien", "authors": ["Aidan O'brien"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.121}, {"id": 331161466, "title": "How To Survive Magnetic Storms In The Alters", "text": "Are you worried about Magnetic Storms in The Alters? This strange phenomenon occurs periodically while exploring the surface of the strange world, often causing chaos inside your base. That said, there are several ways to mitigate potential damage and mishaps, which we will discuss in our guide. How to survive Magnetic Storms in The AltersThe first Magnetic Storm occurs several days into your overland journey. When it happens, all hell will break loose, as Jan and his alters attempt to do everything they can to keep the base intact. What happens during Magnetic Storms?Here's what you can expect during a Magnetic Storm: Radiation sickness accumulates faster if you're outside.The base's radiation shielding will also require more power, which means it will use up your Radiation Filters in the Machinery Room at an alarming rate.Modules and sections of the base will incur damage, so Jan and his clones need to be on top of any repair duties.All alters will work extended shifts, but this won't affect their morale or happiness since everyone's survival is of the utmost importance.Note: If you run out of Radiation Filters and you're unable to craft another one in time, then Jan and his crew will die. Everyone has to put in the work when a Magnetic Storm occurs.The Magnetic Storm Analysis techTo survive Magnetic Storms in The Alters, you need to be well-prepared. The first thing you should do is research the Magnetic Storm Analysis tech via the Research Lab. If you have a Scientist, make sure he's assigned in the room until the project is completed. This particular tech notifies you a few days before the next Magnetic Storm occurs. An icon in the lower-right corner of the screen also counts down the remaining days and hours until this phenomenon triggers once more. The best way to plan ahead when Magnetic Storms next occurIf you want to mitigate the damage from Magnetic Storms in The Alters, you must ensure that you have plenty of the following: Radiation Filter - Costs 10x metals and 40x organics; placed inside the Machinery room to keep the base's radiation shielding active.Repair Kit - Costs 10x metals; used to fix damaged components and rooms so they remain functional.These items can be queued via the \"Uphold\" system in the Production tab. Ideally, you'll want at least three of these readied for any mishaps that may occur. Moreover, you should look at the Assignments tab to see what your alters are doing. You'll want to have at least two characters--one of whom ought to be the Technician--handle maintenance duties. It's risky but also rewarding if you go outside to gather resources in the middle of a Magnetic Storm.Should you even go outside during Magnetic Storms?Going outside during a Magnetic Storm can be quite risky. Radiation levels are higher than normal, though not quite as deadly as nighttime. That said, Magnetic Storms also provide a nifty buff: You're able to mine rapidium and deep deposits faster while a storm is happening. However, if Jan's irradiation level has reached dangerous levels, then you should immediately fast travel back to your hub. You can rest in the Infirmary module if you've built it, which should help cure radiation sickness over time. That does it for our guide on how to survive Magnetic Storms in The Alters.

These odd and eerie objects can be found in various locations, and approaching them is extremely risky. However, some rewards await you if you're curious and brave enough. Our guide has all the details to help you with this particular facet of the game. How to destroy anomalies in The Alters - Anomalies, ALX, and Planetary Samples guideYou'll start finding anomalies upon reaching the game's first act. As you continue to explore the rocky crags and steep cliffsides, you're bound to see strange phenomena in your surroundings. These objects appear as translucent, gaseous wisps that float in mid-air. However, the moment you approach them, Jan will start taking damage. Types of anomaliesThere are several types of anomalies in The Alters. The first type you'll encounter are static. They don't move from their spot, though you have to walk carefully to avoid them. Soon thereafter, you'll come across anomalies that track you down, homing in on you before they explode and inflict irradiation. Much later in the game, you'll find even deadlier and more annoying anomalies. Some are even able to cause time dilation, which cna be a huge hassle when you're trying to make the most out of your precious few hours on the surface. Lastly, there's an anomalous object known as an Interal. Compared to other anomalies, it has a bright greenish hue and it leads to a nifty reward. Static anomalies are fairly easy to avoid since you can go through the gaps in between them.How to craft the LuminatorWhen you first stumble upon an anomaly, you'll be able to speak with Jan Scientist, who's quite curious about these peculiar entities. Then, when you chance upon an Interal, you can talk to Jan Scientist once more. Doing so allows you to craft a Luminator, which requires 20x metals and 20x rapidium. Talking to the Scientist unlocks a means of crafting the Luminator.How to destroy anomalies to obtain ALXThe Luminator is essentially a flashlight that can eliminate anomalies in The Alters. If you've played the Alan Wake games before, then it's akin to shining a light on the darkness nodes to make them explode. In any case, you can select the Luminator via the item/action wheel. Then, shine a light while aiming at the anomaly's bright core. Eventually, the core will burst open, allowing you to pick up a resource called ALX. Note 1: After researching the corresponding techs, you can turn ALX into other resources via the Refinery. Note 2: The Luminator gradually expends Suit Energy whenever you're shining the light on a target. You can either bring some extra Suit Batteries or recharge your energy via outposts. Continuously shine the light on an anomaly's core to blast it.How to destroy Interal Cores to obtain Planetary SamplesLet's go back to what we mentioned earlier regarding Interals. These greenish wisps can also be destroyed using the Luminator. The difference is that doing so reveals luminescent patches of grass and flowers. You then need to follow these lush growths to where they lead. Eventually, you'll come across an Interal Vein Core. Activate the Luminator once more to blast the core so you can pick up a special item known as a Planetary Sample. The Planetary Sample in The Alters can be used to unlock higher-tier techs in the Research Lab. These include suit upgrades, more advanced outposts, and better craftable tools. Planetary Samples from Interal Vein Cores are quite valuable.Note: If you decide to dawdle longer in a region until the sun gets dangerously close, it will trigger the \"High Planetary Activity\" state. It's possible to find another Interal Vein in another location in the region, which means you can obtain an extra Planetary Sample. That does it for our guide on how to destroy anomalies in The Alters.

This large structure acts as your mobile hub throughout the campaign. While the environment outside already has potential threats, you still need to be mindful of what happens inside your home away from home. Our guide has several tips to aid you with this particular facet of the game. How to manage your base in The Alters - Base building and modules guideOnce you have access to your mobile base, you'll notice that several modules/rooms are already active. As you progress further into the campaign, though, you have to focus on what you can add to your hub. This is done via the terminal in the Command Center. Build - The build button allows you to add new modules/rooms.Expand - The expand button increases the available space in your hub, allowing you to plop down more modules.These actions require all sorts of resources that you can find on the planet, including metals, minerals, organics, and even rarer byproducts from anomalies. Some can be obtained by hand, while others require you to scan and mine deep deposits. Note: You can recheck the layout of your hub at any time by opening the Base Overview screen. How to place down new rooms and modulesThe Alters' base building screen in the Command Center lets you organize and reposition modules/rooms as you see fit. You may also refund the cost of a room if you no longer need it. However, you should look at how each module is connected--i.e. all rooms need to have a green outline, which means there's a path that leads to them. Please note that not all rooms are available at the start. Several can only be unlocked once you've completed the research task in the Lab. You can make changes to your base's layout in the Command Center.The most integral rooms for your baseIf you want to manage your base in The Alters, then you should take note of the functions of each room. Modules like the Airlock (i.e. where you enter/exit your base), Captain's Cabin (i.e. where you sleep), Communication Room (i.e. where you make calls), Command Center (i.e. where you rearrange rooms), and Elevators are, naturally, integral throughout your run. Other modules also offer unique functions: Research Lab - Allows you to unlock and research techs once you have a Scientist.Workshop - Lets you craft tools and consumables. You can have more than one Workshop in your hub.Quantum Computer and The Womb - These modules let you examine Jan's life paths to \"birth\" new clones.Machinery - Needs to have a Radiation Filter activated at night or during Magnetic Storms. This prevents Jan and his alters from suffering from radiation sickness.Infirmary - Jan and his clones can recover from injuries and radiation sickness. If you already have a Doctor, then the recovery speed of characters also increases.Greenhouse and Kitchen - The former is used to grow crops, while the latter is used to cook food. Your food can either come from organics or from the crops that you've cultivated. Likewise, each character consumes one meal per day, so you should always have more than enough to go by.Dormitory - This is where your alter clones sleep. You should have one in place to improve conditions in your hub.Recreation: Social Room and Gym - Your alters can relax or exercise to help with their motivation.Contemplation Room - This is where alters go if they feel unmotivated or dejected. The Shrink will be able to counsel them, whereas the Guard will be able to discipline them.Storage - The number and size of Storage rooms you have also increases the amount of resources that your base can hold. You don't need a lot of these early on, as four or five tend to be enough. That said, any excess resources that are gathered will be lost if there is no space available.Recycler - Once researched, this module nets you +5 organics per day depending on the number of people in your base.How to rearrange modules in your baseA few hours into the campaign, you should take some time to properly manage your base in The Alters. Ideally, you should look at the layout of your hub so you can reposition everything according to your needs. Here are our recommendations: Airlock - Use the Airlock as the central fixture since this is where you spawn in whenever you fast travel back to your base.Elevators - From the Airlock, one elevator shaft should span the entirety of the base from top to bottom. We believe this is preferable to the default configuration, which requires navigating two separate shafts.Command Center, Workshop, Research Lab, and Communication Room - These should be fairly close to the Airlock and main elevator shaft due to how often you'd revisit these areas.Quantum Computer and The Womb - Both should be adjacent to one another as they're related to birthing new alters.Kitchen, Dormitory, and other recreational spaces - Alters tend to hang out and rest in these rooms, so it's a good idea to have them close to each other in case new dialogue options appear.Machinery - Just remember to always have extra Radiation Filters that are active. You can also \"uphold\" a certain number of these so you don't have to worry about last-minute crafting.Storage - You can leave these near the bottom of the hub.Note: You don't need to go to each production-related room if you just want to add a craftable item to the queue. Instead, you can do this via the Production menu, before having an alter complete the task via the Assignments menu. However, if you want to manually craft the items yourself, then you have to visit these rooms. Reconfigure and reposition modules so that it's easier to navigate the interior of your base.Base Navigation System: Structures and massProgression throughout the campaign entails moving your base before the burning sun scorches everything around you. Here's a quick summary: The Base Navigation System tells you all the information that you need. This can be accessed via the panel at the right-hand side of the Command Center.Every structure/module that you add increases the total mass of your base.Moving your base to a new region--which also causes the story to advance to the next chapter--requires two things: You must complete the main objectives in the chapter/region.The amount of organics resource that you have in your storage is equivalent to the total mass of your base. For example, if your base's mass is 300, then you must have 300 organics.In the end, you have to decide when to have more modules. You can have a lot of modules early so you can make use of their functions, but you should also consider how this would affect the total mass and the organics that you still have to mine.

Kennedy Jr. ordered the dataset handed over to the Department of Homeland Security, the emails show. Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were given just 54 minutes on Tuesday to comply with the directive.\n\nThe dataset includes the information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. CMS transferred the information just as the Trump administration was ramping up its enforcement efforts in Southern California.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2019s office said in a statement that it was concerned about how deportation officials might utilize the data, especially as federal authorities conduct immigration raids with the assistance of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe deeply value the privacy of all Californians,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.\u201d\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the data sharing was legal.

It appeared to be the most significant attack Iran has faced since its 1980s war with Iraq, with multiple sites around the country hit.\n\nThe leader of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard was feared dead, Iranian state television reported, a development that would be a major body blow to Tehran\u2019s governing theocracy and an immediate escalation of the nations\u2019 long-simmering conflict. The report offered few details about what happened to Gen. Hossein Salami but said that another top Guard official, as well as two nuclear scientists, were also feared dead.\n\nIsraeli leaders said the attack was necessary to head off what they described as an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, and they warned of a reprisal that could target civilians in Israel.\n\nIn Washington, the Trump administration, which earlier cautioned Israel against an attack amid continuing negotiations, said that it had not been involved in the attack and warned Iran against retaliations against U.S. interests or personnel.\n\nMultiple sites in the capital were hit in the attack, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said targeted both nuclear and military sites. Also targeted were officials leading Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal.\n\nThe assault came amid warnings from Israel that it would not permit Tehran to build a nuclear weapon, though it remains unclear how close the country actually is to achieving that.\n\nNetanyahu said in an address on YouTube that the attacks will continue \u201cfor as many days at it takes to remove this threat.\u201d\n\nThe attack followed increasing tensions that led the U.S. to pull some diplomats from Iraq\u2019s capital and to offer voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took \u201cunilateral action against Iran\u201d and that Israel advised the U.S. that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense.\n\n\u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,\u201d Rubio said in a statement released by the White House that warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel.\n\nThe attack comes as tensions have reached new heights over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nThe Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years on Thursday censured Iran over its refusal to work with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more-advanced ones.\n\nThere are multiple assessments on how many nuclear weapons Iran could potentially build, should it choose to do so. Iran would need months to assemble, test and field any weapon, which it so far has said it has no desire to do. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess Iran does not have a weapons program at this time.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude spiked on news of the attack, rising nearly 5%.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that his country carried out the attack, without saying what it targeted.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the state of Israel\u2019s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that Katz \u201csigned a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,\u201d it said\n\nBoth Iran and Israel closed their airspace.\n\nAs the explosions in Tehran started, President Donald Trump was on the lawn of the White House mingling with members of Congress. It was unclear if he had been informed, but the president continued shaking hands and posing for pictures for several minutes.\n\nTrump earlier said he was urging Netanyahu to hold off from taking action for the time being while the administration negotiated with Iran.\n\n\u201cAs long as I think there is a [chance for an] agreement, I don\u2019t want them going in because I think it would blow it,\u201d Trump told reporters.", "summary": "The attack hit multiple sites and killed the head of the Revolutionary Guards.

Tehranchi was a theoretical physicist.\n\nThey appear to have been targeted in their homes. Iranian state television also reported that children had been killed in at least one of the airstrikes, on a residential area of Tehran.\n\nExplosions were reported in Natanz, Tehran and elsewhere in Iran, while sirens and mobile phone alerts went off across Israel, as the nation braced for a response from Tehran. Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport was closed to all flights.\n\n\u201cThe response to the Israeli attack will be harsh and decisive,\u201d an Iranian security source told the Reuters news agency, adding that details of Iran\u2019s retaliation \u201care being discussed at the highest levels\u201d.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a statement describing the operation as \u201ca pre-emptive, precise, combined offensive to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear programme\u201d.\n\n\u201cDozens of [Israeli air force] jets completed the first stage that included strikes on dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran,\u201d the statement added.\n\nJustifying the attack, Netanyahu said Iran was not only building up its supply of fissile enriched uranium, claiming it now had enough for nine warheads, but also that it had taken unprecedented steps towards building bombs.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before, steps to weaponise this enriched uranium, and if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months, less than a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why we have no choice but to act and act now. The hardest decision any leader has to make is sworn in danger before it is fully materialised,\u201d he said, pointing to the western allies\u2019 failure to stop Nazi aggression in the 1930s.\n\nThe attack on Iran comes a few days before a new round of US-Iranian talks were due in Oman, aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, which has expanded rapidly since 2018 Donald Trump withdrew from an international deal constraining the programme.\n\nHours before the strikes began, Trump had acknowledged there was a risk of an Israeli attack on Iran and had sought to discourage it, while talks with Tehran were still under way. \u201cI don\u2019t want them going in,\u201d he said, warning it would \u201cblow\u201d the chances for a diplomatic solution. It was unclear how much, if any, warning Israel gave Washington of its strikes.\n\nSecretary of state Marco Rubio said the US had not taken part in the Israeli attack. \u201cTonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defence.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and the administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.\u201d\n\nDemocratic senator Chris Murphy, said that Israel\u2019s decision to act unilaterally was a measure of Trump\u2019s weakness on the world stage.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s attack on Iran, clearly intended to scuttle the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations with Iran, risks a regional war that will likely be catastrophic for America and is further evidence of how little respect world powers \u2013 including our own allies \u2013 have for President Trump,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nIsrael is likely to need US support in its defence if Israel responds with a missile barrage. In his speech, Netanyahu praised Trump for his efforts in confronting Iran but claimed that Tehran was just using negotiations to \u201cbuy time\u201d. He claimed that Israel was not just acting in its own defence.\n\n\u201cI want to assure the civilised world, we will not let the world\u2019s most dangerous regime get the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons, and Iran plans to give those weapons - nuclear weapons - to its terrorist proxies that would make the nightmare of nuclear terrorism all too real,\u201d he said. \u201cThe increasing range of Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles would bring that nuclear nightmare to the cities of Europe and eventually to America.\u201d", "summary": "Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says attack dubbed Rising Lion would take \u2018many days\u2019\n\n\nLive coverage: nuclear sites targeted in Israel\u2019s attack on Iran\n\nIsrael has launched an attack on Iran aimed at \u201cdozens\u201d of targets including its nuclear facilities, military commanders and scientists, claiming it had taken unilateral action because Tehran had begun to build nuclear warheads.\n\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the attack, dubbed Rising Lion, was aimed at \u201crolling back the Iranian threat to Israel\u2019s very survival\u201d, adding that it would take \u201cmany days\u201d.\n\n Continue reading...", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-netanyahu", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/640e7bd9e7a5f6727ff02b36de7b097efe786254/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 03:05:08", "author": "Julian Borger", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.322}, {"id": 330993824, "title": "Netanyahu says Iran could produce nuclear weapon in \u2018very short time\u2019 if not stopped after Israel launches air strikes", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the \u201cJewish people refuse to be the victims of a nuclear Holocaust\u201d as he targeted sites that could produce nuclear weapons in a \u201cvery short time.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu reported that Iran had produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs and began making \u201csteps to weaponize\u201d the uranium in recent months.\n\n\u201cIf not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time,\u201d he said during a video address Friday morning. \u201cThis is a clear and present danger to Israel\u2019s very survival.\n\nNetanyahu claimed the weapon of mass destruction could be developed within a year.\n\n\u201cToday the Jewish people refuse to be the victims of a nuclear Holocaust perpetrated by the Iranian regime,\u201d he said. \u201cAs prime minister, I made the clear time and again, Israel will never allow those who call for our annihilation to develop the means to achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s preemptive airstrikes, dubbed Operation: Rising Lion, targeted nuclear sites across Iran, including its capital, Tehran.\n\nGen.

Of the 10 rescued, four were taken to hospitals with minor injuries. The fire department called the response an \"extremely difficult rescue effort that covered multiple miles.\"The search is ongoing for the two people who are believed to have been swept away in the floodwaters, the agency said. \"While the majority of the water rescue responses were not severe in nature and consisted of our crews assisting drivers from vehicles that were stalled in high water, several of these calls were harrowing and involved our crews entering swift moving water to effect rescues,\" the fire department said in its release. One woman, Angel Richards, told KENS 5 that her husband, Stevie, was on his way to work when he called to say he was caught in the floodwaters. \"It's hard because I was on the phone when this happened, and then not to have a lot of communication, to see my car, it's devastating to me,\" Richards told KENS 5. \"No one can say to me, 'Hey, this is what's going on.'\"", "summary": "Heavy overnight rains led to water rescue calls in northeastern San Antonio, near the city's Perrin Beitel neighborhood.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deadly-san-antonio-flooding/", "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/12/e0a86c2f-7b76-4ca8-86e2-887056ef8531/thumbnail/1200x630/c334ad6bea670cc23153298aff7169b4/ap25163712170780.jpg?v=d2f497bd9339ad99d2e0559414346698", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 01:01:59", "author": "Kierra Frazier", "authors": ["Kierra Frazier"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.482}, {"id": 330889494, "title": "At Least 5 Dead and 2 Missing in San Antonio After Heavy Rains Flood Parts of Texas", "text": "SAN ANTONIO\u2014Heavy rains in San Antonio rapidly flooded roads, swept away submerged cars and sent some people scrambling up trees to escape fast-rising waters Thursday while firefighters made dozens of rescues across the nation\u2019s seventh-largest city.

The beloved DreamWorks trilogy, loosely inspired by Cressida Cowell\u2019s novels, grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide.\n\n Like the animated original, Universal's latest adaptation follows Hiccup, a young Viking who befriends a dragon named Toothless, defying tradition and changing the course of his village.\n\n The new version features fresh leads, with Mason Thames playing Hiccup and Nico Parker as Astrid, while Gerard Butler reprises his role as Stoick, Hiccup\u2019s father and chief of their tribe. As a longtime fan, Thames told ClutchPoints in August 2024 that playing Hiccup was both an honor and a challenge.\n\n \u201cIt was a lot of pressure for me because I love Hiccup so much,\" the actor said. \"And I know how many people love the movies, and I didn't want to let anybody down.

Here's our best guess\n\nDespite trepidation around this trend of remakes, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" looks to be off to a flying start. The new release is Certified Fresh on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, and currently holds a near-perfect 99% rating from fans, too.\n\nWaiting to watch \"How to Train Your Dragon\" from the comfort of your own sofa? Well, we do not currently have a confirmed home release date for the new movie.\nHowever, if you're waiting to watch the live-action movie at home, or you've already seen it and want to relive the adventure all over again, here's my best guess at the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" streaming date.\nWhen is 'How to Train Your Dragon' streaming? \n\nHow To Train Your Dragon | Official Trailer - YouTube\n\nAt the time of writing, the only way to watch the live-action \"How to Train Your Dragon\" remake is by heading to your local movie theater, and seeing as it only came to theaters on June 13, that probably won't change for a while yet.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nAnd, of course, would-be streamers will first have to wait for the movie to do the rounds on premium video-on-demand (PVOD) platforms, first.\nHowever, being a Universal release, we can at least presume that when \"How to Train Your Dragon\" comes to streaming, it'll first be made available to watch on Peacock.\nAt the time of writing, I'd guess that \"How to Train Your Dragon\" will come to Peacock at some point in October 2025. \nThat's based on how long we've waited for past DreamWorks features to come to NBCUniversal's streamer. For example, we waited 120 days between \"The Wild Robot's\" theatrical and streaming debut.\nSimilarly, \"Dog Man\" came to Peacock on Friday, May 30, 120 days after it premiered in theaters on January 31, while \"Kung Fu Panda 4\" had a slightly quicker turnaround, arriving on Peacock 106 days after hitting theaters in March 2024.\nOf course, if the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" live-action remake really takes flight at the box office, there's always the chance it might stay in theaters even longer. And, of course, that above release window is just a guess; nothing's official just yet.\nAs and when we get a confirmed \"How To Train Your Dragon\" streaming date, we'll be sure to update this article and include it here, so keep checking back.\nIf you're looking for more streaming fun while you wait to watch \"How to Train Your Dragon\" at home, why not check out our guide to the best family movies on Netflix for more recommendations fit for your next family movie night?\nMore from Tom's Guide\n\nHow to get Peacock for free\nNetflix's updated homepage is getting pushback from users\nWhen is \"The Phoenician Scheme\" coming to streaming?

(AP) \u2014 Attorneys in the murder trial of Karen Read initiated their closing arguments on Friday following weeks of testimony in this intensely divisive case. The prosecution argues a narrative of a doomed romantic relationship turned lethal, while the defense posits that members of a close-knit Boston area law enforcement group were responsible for the murder of a fellow officer.\n\nRead, 45, stands accused of fatally hitting her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, 46, with her SUV, abandoning him to perish in the snow outside a party attended by other local police officers and a federal agent, all who concluded their evening of drinking in 2022. She faces charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene in Canton, near Boston.\n\nThe defense for Read claims she was the target of an extensive conspiracy, involving the planting of evidence and using her as an easy scapegoat for her boyfriend\u2019s death.\n\nThe first Read trial ended July 1 in a mistrial due to a hung jury, and several jurors came out after to say that the panel had unanimously agreed that Read was not guilty of the most serious charge of second-degree murder.\n\nProsecution has focused on the scene of death\n\nThe state\u2019s case was led by special prosecutor Hank Brennan, who called fewer witnesses than prosecutor Adam Lally, who ran the first trial against Read.\n\nBrennan has referenced Read\u2019s statement about the possibility that she backed into O\u2019Keefe, which the defense has pointed out came not from police reports but from a voluntary interview she did for a documentary series. In the television interview, Read said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I hit him,\u201d but acknowledged she could have \u201cclipped him.\u201d\n\nIn the first trial, the state called Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in the case. Proctor would later be fired after a disciplinary board found he sent sexist and crude text messages about Read. Proctor was asked to read the texts aloud in court during the first trial, but in the second, the prosecution relied on others to read the offensive comments.\n\nThe defense called one of Proctor\u2019s friends to read more texts that suggested he had focused on Read early in the investigation. During the first trial, Proctor acknowledged being friends with Kevin Albert, a Canton police officer who is the brother of the owner of the home where the party was held.\n\nProsecutors this time focused on evidence from the scene, and tried to make the point that broken pieces of Read\u2019s taillight show she struck O\u2019Keefe with her vehicle. The defense has argued that the taillight was actually damaged when Read was backing out of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s house and hit his car. They have suggested Proctor and others could have colluded to plant the pieces of broken plastic near O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body after they took the vehicle back to the police department.\n\nExperts called by the prosecutors testified that data on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s phone matched with it being located near a flagpole on the lawn, near the street, where his body was found. There was also no phone activity after that and the phone\u2019s battery temperature dropped considerably, the specialist said. Another specialist used GPS and phone data to place Read\u2019s vehicle at the scene around the same time.\n\nAnother expert testified that Read\u2019s vehicle reversed more than 50 feet (15 meters) at about 23 mph (37 kph).\n\nAndre Porto, a forensic scientist who works in the DNA unit of the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, detailed various items he tested, including the broken rear taillight and pieces of a broken cocktail glass found in the yard. Only O\u2019Keefe was a likely match for both. A hair found on Read\u2019s vehicle was a match for O\u2019Keefe. Traces of DNA from three people, O\u2019Keefe and two unknown individuals, were on the outside of Read\u2019s taillight and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s clothing, Porto said.\n\nProsecutors called a neurosurgeon who testified that O\u2019Keefe suffered a \u201cclassic blunt trauma injury\u201d associated with falling backward and hitting his head. The broken cocktail glass found at the scene is another key piece of evidence, prosecutors have said, because O\u2019Keefe was holding it when Read dropped him off.\n\nThe prosecution pointed out that Read and O\u2019Keefe were fighting. Voicemails recovered from Read\u2019s phone in which she said, \u201cI (expletive) hate you,\u201d to O\u2019Keefe were played in court. That voicemail would have arrived while he was lying in the snow.\n\nThe defense\u2019s strategy in the second trial\n\nRead\u2019s defense team has cast doubt on the state\u2019s case by suggesting Read was framed.\n\nThe defense has painted a picture of a deceitful web of people in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s social network who saw Read as a scapegoat for his death. The network includes federal agent Brian Higgins, who exchanged flirtatious text messages with Read, leading the defense to question if that led to a fatal confrontation. Higgins was present at the party on the night of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWhat happened inside that house, that basement or that garage? What evidence was there for investigators to look into? What did they ignore?\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson asked, noting the \u201cobvious dog bites\u201d on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm and the head injury from his falling backward onto a hard surface.\n\nDefense attorneys also presented a different view of how Read\u2019s taillight was cracked. They have attempted to show, via witnesses, surveillance video and photographs, that Read may have damaged her taillight the morning after O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death when she backed out of his driveway and bumped his car with her own.\n\nNicholas Barros, a police officer at a department where Read\u2019s car was impounded, testified that he saw only a small crack in Read\u2019s taillight when the car first arrived. The defense has pointed out that the taillight later looked much more damaged, arguing it could have been tampered with.\n\nA crash expert who testified for the defense said, based on every test he performed, the damage to Read\u2019s taillight and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s clothing was inconsistent with her SUV striking an arm or body at the speed described by the prosecution.\n\nThe defense has also questioned why investigators never entered the home where the party took place, although witnesses from the scene and prosecutors have said O\u2019Keefe never went inside.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Laposata, a former medical examiner called by the defense, said O\u2019Keefe\u2019s injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma to the back of the head, but that his eye wounds were not consistent with being hit by the rear of Read\u2019s SUV. She testified she did not think O\u2019Keefe was hit by the SUV at all.\n\nThe defense also questioned Jennifer McCabe, who was at the house party and is the sister-in-law of the host, retired Boston police officer Brian Albert. McCabe made a misspelled web search, \u201chos long to die in cold,\u201d after O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.\n\nThe timing of the search has been in question. The defense argued that McCabe made the search at about 2:30 a.m. and helped cover for the real killer. The prosecution claims she searched after O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body was found later in the morning.\n\nThe defense called into question the actions of others who were at the party the night O\u2019Keefe died. The party happened at the home of Albert, and after O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death, the Alberts rehomed their dog Chloe \u2014 who the defense claims bit O\u2019Keefe \u2014 and refurbished their basement before selling their home at a loss.\n\nDr. Marie Russell, a retired emergency medicine physician, testified that the wounds on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arms were the result of a dog attack, injuries the prosecution attributes to being struck by Read\u2019s vehicle.\n\nThe judge in the case did not allow medical examiner Laposata to testify specifically about potential dog bite wounds, but did allow her to testify that some of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm injuries were consistent with an animal bite, not with wounds from a broken taillight.\n\nThe defense introduced phone records that showed unanswered calls between Albert and Higgins in the early morning hours after O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. They both later destroyed their phones, with Higgins testifying in the first trial that he obliterated his phone\u2019s SIM card and disposed of it at a military base. The defense also introduced records from McCabe that showed she repeatedly called O\u2019Keefe after midnight, calls she described as \u201cbutt dials.\u201d\n\nRead faces a maximum penalty of a life sentence if convicted.\n\nWhittle reported from Scarborough, Maine.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDEDHAM, Mass.

He reminded jurors that even Read herself suggested she did it.\n\n\u201cThe timeline in this case is beyond dispute. You can accuse, assault, characterize, malign, twist. The timeline doesn\u2019t change. It is data. Data is data,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nThe prosecutor, who significantly streamlined the case this time, was focused on the science and data instead of who was in the house at 34 Fairview Road.\n\n\u201cBlood was taken, the samples, the retrograde analysis, almost two to three times the legal limit. She was drunk. She hit him,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nAs for the lead Massachusetts State Police investigator, Trooper Michael Proctor, who was fired for inappropriate text messages that were read in court, Brennan said his misconduct had no impact on the scientific data in the case.\n\n\u201cWhen you read those text messages, they\u2019re hard to look at. It\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s unfair. And if there\u2019s a penalty more than being fired, maybe that penalty will be deserved, but it had nothing to do with the justice in this case. It just doesn\u2019t,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nBrennan, after his one hour and 15 minute closing, said there is only one conclusion that can be drawn from this eight-week trial \u2014 Read knew she hit O\u2019Keefe and drove off after.\n\n\u201cJohn O\u2019Keefe is not a body. John O\u2019Keefe is not a buffalo on a prairie. John O\u2019Keefe was a person. And he was murdered by Karen Read,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nBrennan also told jurors O\u2019Keefe wasn\u2019t bitten by a dog.\n\nAfter both the prosecution and defense made their closing arguments, the jury was sent to deliberate Friday afternoon.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

Unlike the scenes in front of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) building downtown, where hundreds had been gathering since last Friday, there were no protesters around, apparently either not knowing or not caring that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem would be holding a press conference at 10:30 a.m.\n\nBy 10:45 a.m., when it became clear we were not going to be let inside, a few of us gathered around an L.A. Times reporter's phone to listen to a live feed coming from a local station. Noem started by thanking law enforcement (\"They've been absolute rock stars\") and reaffirming the Trump administration's commitment to continuing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, which Noem said had so far resulted in more than 1,200 arrests.\n\n\"Let me give you a few examples,\" she said, citing \"a Vietnamese illegal alien who committed a mass shooting at a graduation party in 1994\" before her voice was lost under the sound of a scuffle, and someone shouting \"I have questions for the secretary,\" and then \"Hands off!\"\n\n\"What just happened?!\" asked the Times reporter as the live feed cut out and then came back.\n\n\"Just a moment ago, a remarkable moment, kind of stunning,\" came an anchor over the feed. \"We heard a voice off-camera that appeared to be trying to interrupt this secretary. We panned the camera to see where the disruption came from. It came from United States Senator Alex Padilla\u2026.He was taken\u2014he was by force\u2014he was taken outside the room. I've never seen anything like it,\" continued the anchor. \"But that gives you a sense as to the incendiary nature of what we're seeing on the streets.\"\n\nMaybe. Maybe, as Sen. Lindsay Graham (R\u2013S.C.) later suggested, Padilla \"got what he wanted\u2014he's on TV.\" Or maybe it was as simple as Padilla himself suggested: He had a question, a question he didn't get to ask as FBI personnel and Secret Service agents pushed him into the hall, onto the ground, and handcuffed him.\n\nWhether Padilla's interruption was intentional or not, it derailed the press conference. As ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons was insisting that his department was \"focused on gang members, human traffickers, violent drug dealers, and rapists,\" and Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of FBI Los Angeles, announced they had identified Elpidio Reyna, who had allegedly thrown rocks at federal law enforcement, every journalist in attendance was checking social media or messaging with their editors: Had Padilla really lunged at Noem? Was he under arrest? The possibility that the freshman senator would emerge and make a statement became the day's animating factor. Before the press conference was over, the number of camera crews and reporters had tripled.\n\nNoem herself, after declaring for the second time that federal law enforcement intended to \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles, seemed unruffled by the incident.\n\n\"I don't even know the senator,\" Noem said after a reporter asked whether she was going to press charges against Padilla. \"He did not request a meeting with me or to speak with me. So when I leave here, I'll have a conversation with him and visit and find out really what his concerns were.\"\n\nPadilla and Noem apparently did meet, and Noem later said they had a \"great\" conversation. She appeared upbeat as she left the federal building.\n\nPadilla did not look upbeat as he emerged half an hour later; as he pressed through the scrum of reporters, he looked and sounded beaten down and had a hitch in his voice as he explained what had happened. He had been in the building on a different matter when he learned Noem was there.\n\n\"Over the course of recent weeks, I\u2014several of my colleagues\u2014have been asking the Department of Homeland Security for more information and more answers on their increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions,\" said Padilla. \"And we've gotten little to no information in response to our inquiries.\"\n\nPadilla said that while listening to Noem, he had a question and started to ask it. \"I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room. I was forced to the ground and I was handcuffed,\" he said. \"If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country.\"\n\nThe reactions to this red meat broke along predictable lines. \"Trump and his shock troops are out of control,\" California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, posted on X. Meanwhile, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R\u2013Ga.) said Padilla \"should be prosecuted.\"\n\nSome marginally broke rank. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R\u2013Alaska) said the video of Padilla being removed was \"shocking at every level.\" She went on to say, \"It's not the America I know.\"\n\nThere was one camp that did not express outrage as much as umbrage: the journalists covering the event. After Padilla was escorted to the parking lot, several reporters jawed that it was not the senator's place to storm a press conference, that some of us weren't even able to get inside, and that we don't get to, say, vote on the Senate floor just because we happen to be in the building.\n\nThe KNX reporter held out his press pass. \"You have one of these?\" he asked. \"No? Then you're a second-class citizen, Senator. Resign your job and get a press pass, and then you'll be able to ask the questions.\"", "summary": "The California senator was trying to ask about immigration enforcement when federal agents handcuffed and ejected him.", "url": "https://reason.com/2025/06/13/sen-padilla-forcibly-removed-from-kristi-noems-l-a-press-conference/", "image": "https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/6-12-25-v6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 15:29:52", "author": "Jacob Sullum,Nancy Rommelmann", "authors": ["Jacob Sullum", "Nancy Rommelmann"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.349}, {"id": 331155164, "title": "Democrats cash in after Padilla forcibly removed from Trump admin press conference", "text": "The forcible removal of Sen. Alex Padilla of California \u2013 as he attempted to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a news conference \u2013 instantly made national headlines. But Thursday's incident, in which Padilla was handcuffed and briefly detained by officers as he aimed to speak out in opposition to Trump administration immigration raids that sparked unrest in Los Angeles and smaller protests across the country, may also pay off for the senator and fellow Democrats. Padilla, along with fellow California Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), on Friday sent out fundraising emails to supporters highlighting the incident.

Schiff, in his fundraising email, called Padilla \"one of the most decent people I know.\" PADILLA CUFFED, MCIVER INDICTED: CAN CONGRESS COME BACK FROM THE BRINK? And the DNC charged that the senator's forced removal was one of the Trump administration's \"steps toward authoritarianism.\" Videos of the incident showed Padilla attempting to walk up to Noem while she was speaking at a podium during a press conference. Padilla simultaneously attempted to shout over Noem, but law enforcement stepped in and forcefully stopped Padilla's advance. Padilla was eventually taken to the ground and handcuffed, the videos showed. Fox News reporters who were present at the news conference said Padilla appeared to be detained for a period of time. Democrats quickly united in support of Padilla and condemned the Trump administration, while some Republicans accused the senator of grandstanding. The incident came amid a week of protests in Los Angeles sparked by immigration raids carried out by ICE at the Trump administration's direction. The president sent in National Guard troops and even mobilized Marines in an attempt to quell the unrest. Trump is also fundraising off the unrest in Los Angeles. The Trump National Committee JFC, which is one of the joint-fundraising committees set up by then-former president during his successful 2024 campaign to win back the White House, sent out a fundraising email on Thursday.

CASSIDY, Associated Press\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overhaul elections in the U.S., siding with a group of Democratic state attorneys general who challenged the effort as unconstitutional.\n\nThe Republican president\u2019s March 25 executive order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline.\n\nThe attorneys general said the directive \u201cusurps the States\u2019 constitutional power and seeks to amend election law by fiat.\u201d The White House defended the order as \u201cstanding up for free, fair and honest elections\u201d and called proof of citizenship a \u201ccommonsense\u201d requirement.\n\nJudge Denise J. Casper of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts said in Friday\u2019s order that the states had a likelihood of success as to their legal challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not grant the President any specific powers over elections,\u201d Casper wrote.\n\nCasper also noted that, when it comes to citizenship, \u201cthere is no dispute (nor could there be) that U.S. citizenship is required to vote in federal elections and the federal voter registration forms require attestation of citizenship.\u201d\n\nCasper cited arguments made by the states that the requirements would \u201cburden the States with significant efforts and substantial costs\u201d to update procedures.\n\nThe ruling is the second legal setback for Trump\u2019s election order. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., previously blocked parts of the directive, including the proof-of-citizenship requirement for the federal voter registration form.\n\nThe order is the culmination of Trump\u2019s longstanding complaints about elections. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally.\u201d Since 2020, Trump has made false claims of widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines to explain his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nHe has said his executive order secures elections against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it\u2019s rare and typically a mistake. Casting a ballot as a noncitizen is already against the law and can result in fines and deportation if convicted.\n\nThe order also would require states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day and puts states\u2019 federal funding at risk if election officials don\u2019t comply. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nOregon and Washington, which conduct their elections almost entirely by mail, filed a separate lawsuit over the ballot deadline, saying the executive order could disenfranchise voters in their states. When the lawsuit was filed, Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs noted that more than 300,000 ballots in the state arrived after Election Day in 2024.\n\nTrump\u2019s order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls. But many legal experts say the order exceeds Trump\u2019s power because the Constitution gives states the authority to set the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d of elections, with Congress allowed to set rules for elections to federal office. As Friday\u2019s ruling states, the Constitution makes no provision for presidents to set the rules for elections.\n\nDuring a hearing earlier this month on the states\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, lawyers for the states and lawyers for the administration argued over the implications of Trump\u2019s order, whether the changes could be made in time for next year\u2019s midterm elections and how much it would cost the states.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Bridget O\u2019Hickey said during the hearing that the order seeks to provide a single set of rules for certain aspects of election operations rather than having a patchwork of state laws and that any harm to the states is speculation.\n\nO\u2019Hickey also claimed that mailed ballots received after Election Day might somehow be manipulated, suggesting people could retrieve their ballots and alter their votes based on what they see in early results. But all ballots received after Election Day require a postmark showing they were sent on or before that date, and that any ballot with a postmark after Election Day would not count.", "summary": "A judge in Massachusetts has blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s election executive order, siding with Democratic state attorneys who called it overreach.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/13/trump-election-executive-order-blocked/", "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump_19305_d83a99.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 12:58:39", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.748}, {"id": 331109624, "title": "Court Stops Trump\u2019s Election Executive Order, Sides with Democrat-Led States", "text": "US \n\n NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Casper of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts said in Friday's order that the states had a likelihood of success as to their legal challenges.\u201cThe Constitution does not grant the President any specific powers over elections,\u201d Casper wrote.Casper also noted that, when it comes to citizenship, \u201cthere is no dispute (nor could there be) that U.S. citizenship is required to vote in federal elections and the federal voter registration forms require attestation of citizenship.\u201dCasper cited arguments made by the states that the requirements would \u201cburden the States with significant efforts and substantial costs\u201d to update procedures.The ruling is the second legal setback for Trump\u2019s election order. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., previously blocked parts of the directive, including the proof-of-citizenship requirement for the federal voter registration form.The order is the culmination of Trump\u2019s longstanding complaints about elections. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally.\u201d Since 2020, Trump has made false claims of widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines to explain his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.He has said his executive order secures elections against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it's rare and typically a mistake. Casting a ballot as a noncitizen is already against the law and can result in fines and deportation if convicted.RELATED STORY | States sue to block Trump's election order, saying it violates the ConstitutionThe order also would require states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day and puts states\u2019 federal funding at risk if election officials don\u2019t comply. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Oregon and Washington, which conduct their elections almost entirely by mail, filed a separate lawsuit over the ballot deadline, saying the executive order could disenfranchise voters in their states. When the lawsuit was filed, Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs noted that more than 300,000 ballots in the state arrived after Election Day in 2024.Trump\u2019s order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls. But many legal experts say the order exceeds Trump\u2019s power because the Constitution gives states the authority to set the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d of elections, with Congress allowed to set rules for elections to federal office. As Friday's ruling states, the Constitution makes no provision for presidents to set the rules for elections.During a hearing earlier this month on the states\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, lawyers for the states and lawyers for the administration argued over the implications of Trump\u2019s order, whether the changes could be made in time for next year\u2019s midterm elections and how much it would cost the states.Justice Department lawyer Bridget O\u2019Hickey said during the hearing that the order seeks to provide a single set of rules for certain aspects of election operations rather than having a patchwork of state laws and that any harm to the states is speculation.RELATED STORY | Trump signs executive order mandating proof of citizenship for votersO\u2019Hickey also claimed that mailed ballots received after Election Day might somehow be manipulated, suggesting people could retrieve their ballots and alter their votes based on what they see in early results.

More than 95 percent of these real estate losses affected single-family homes.State Farm, the largest home insurer in the country, said it had received a total of 12,855 claims related to the fires as of June 10 and had already paid more than $3.96 billion in claims. The company has estimated that the January wildfires will cost it a total of $7.6 billion, though reinsurance payments from its parent company would lower the losses to about $612 million.While State Farm says it is paying claims to policyholders affected by the fires in keeping with its \"promise to customers,\" several customers have accused the insurer of mishandling, delaying and denying claims in the weeks and months following the blazes, leaving them in precarious financial positions or forced to stay in dangerous homes.Anger against the company has been boiling over in California since January following reports that the insurer had cut hundreds of policies in areas affected by the fires only months before the blazes broke out.That anger is mounting as many policyholders feel they are not being treated fairly by the company, which has asked for a 17 percent emergency rate hike to stabilize its financial position in the state after the fires.What Is the Investigation About?Lara announced on Wednesday that the California Department of Insurance had initiated a market conduct examination of State Farm, expanding its ongoing investigation into consumer complaints against the insurer. This type of inquiry includes a \"thorough, fact-based review\" that typically takes several months, the department said.The commissioner said the department had received numerous complaints from policyholders, with \"some troubling patterns\" emerging from them, including \"the frequent reassignment of multiple adjusters with little continuity in communication, inconsistent management of similar claims, and inadequate record-keeping or information-sharing among claims teams.\"These issues create \"unnecessary stress\" for policyholders, \"prolong recovery, and erode trust,\" Lara said. The commissioner added that while the department had launched an investigation, it could take action and advocate for consumers only if it received a formal complaint.\"I urge any wildfire survivor facing delayed payments, claim disputes, multiple adjusters, smoke damage issues, or any other problems to file a formal complaint with my Department,\" Lara said.Complaints can be submitted on the department's website at insurance.ca.gov, or homeowners can call 800-927-HELP.State Farm has said it is cooperating with the California Department of Insurance in the market conduct exam process.What Are People Saying?Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a news release following Wednesday's announcement: \"Californians deserve fair and comprehensive treatment from their insurance companies. No one should be left in uncertainty, forced to fight for what they are owed, or face endless delays that often lead consumers to give up.\"While there are national standards for insurance claims handling, they can be vague and inconsistently applied, especially during large-scale, climate-driven disasters. This examination will assess whether State Farm has complied with California's consumer protection and claims handling laws and will help determine if further reforms are needed as natural disasters increasingly disrupt insurance markets across the country.\"Assemblymember John Harabedian, a Democrat representing Pasadena, said in a news release: \"Following the Eaton Fire, our community deserves clear communication and fair treatment to facilitate a swift rebuilding process. I have received numerous complaints from neighbors regarding the claims process. A market conduct examination will provide the clarity we urgently need. I am grateful to Commissioner Lara for taking action to demand transparency and ensure that families receive the answers they deserve.\"State Farm said in a news release on Thursday: \"A fair review will find that thousands of State Farm customers are being helped by our teams on the ground in Los Angeles County and are very satisfied. Our efforts will remain on serving all our customers and meeting our obligations under the contract while providing the necessary information to the CDI. The Department routinely examines all insurance companies. These exams help ensure processes and procedures are in full compliance with state regulations.\"What Will Happen Next?The investigation launched by California regulators on Wednesday is expected to take months. Meanwhile, California homeowners who have insurance policies with State Farm are likely to face a rate increase this year as the carrier's request for a 17 percent hike received interim approval by the California insurance commissioner last month.The rate changes are expected to affect homeowners renewing their policies on or after June 1, 2025.", "summary": "California regulators are investigating State Farm after wildfire survivors complained about how the insurer handled their claims.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/california-investigate-state-farm-wildfire-insurance-claims-2084988", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662390/state-farm-wildfires-california.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 10:51:31", "author": "Giulia Carbonaro", "authors": ["Giulia Carbonaro"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.463}, {"id": 331070884, "title": "State Farm under investigation for handling of California wildfire claims", "text": "California Department of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara on Thursday, June 12, announced an investigation into State Farm over the insurer\u2019s handling of thousands of claims made by survivors of the Eaton and Palisades fires.\n\nJust over five months since the fires devastated Southern California communities, the Department of Insurance said it had initiated a market conduct examination of State Farm, expanding an ongoing investigation into consumer complaints against the company.\n\n\u201cThis examination will assess whether State Farm has complied with California\u2019s consumer protection and claims handling laws and will help determine if further reforms are needed as natural disasters increasingly disrupt insurance markets across the country,\u201d Lara said in a statement.\n\nComplaints against State Farm or other insurers can be submitted online or by calling 800-927-HELP.\n\n\u201cThe strongest evidence we can present is the voice of consumers themselves,\u201d Lara said. \u201cI urge any wildfire survivor facing delayed payments, claim disputes, multiple adjusters, smoke damage issues, or any other problems to file a formal complaint with my department.\u201d\n\nLara said patterns that will be investigated include the frequent reassignment of multiple adjusters with little continuity in communication, inconsistent management of similar claims and inadequate record keeping or information sharing among claims teams.\n\nAccording to the department, it has recovered more than $40 million for wildfire survivors through intervention on formal consumer complaints.

Last month Lara announced the launch of a Smoke Claims & Remediation Task Force.\n\n\u201cCalifornians deserve to return to homes that are truly safe, not forced to handle smoke, soot, and ash on their own,\u201d Lara said. \u201cOur goal is to close the protection gap and make sure insurance works the way it is supposed to, especially in the face of climate-intensified disasters.\u201d", "summary": "Just over five months since the fires devastated Southern California communities, the Department of Insurance said it had initiated a market conduct examination of State Farm, expanding an ongoing investigation into consumer complaints against the company.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/13/state-farm-under-investigation-for-handling-of-eaton-palisades-wildfire-claims/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LDN-L-REBUILD-BOS-016-0604.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-13 13:23:19", "author": "David Wilson", "authors": ["David Wilson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.263}, {"id": 331180508, "title": "California insurance regulator launches investigation into State Farm over claims from LA fires", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California's top insurance regulator on Thursday launched an investigation into State Farm over the company's handling of claims from the January Los Angeles-area wildfires.\n\nThe investigation comes after survivors of the Palisades and Eaton fires said that the state's largest home insurer was delaying and mishandling claims regarding damage to their homes and possible contamination from smoke.\n\nThe blazes destroyed thousands of buildings around Los Angeles, killed 30 people and displaced thousands of others. They were estimated to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said the investigation will review whether the company complied with state consumer protection and claim-handling laws.\n\n\"Californians deserve fair and comprehensive treatment from their insurance companies,\" the Democrat said in a statement. \"No one should be left in uncertainty, forced to fight for what they are owed, or face endless delays that often lead consumers to give up.\"\n\nState Farm, which has about 1 million home insurance customers in California, said it will cooperate with the state's review. The insurer has received roughly 13,000 claims related to the fires and has paid out about $4 billion to customers, the company said.\n\n\"We're here to help our customers recover and we empathize with those who are rebuilding their lives,\" State Farm said in a statement. \"Our focus continues to be on supporting our customers in their recovery from the largest fire event we have ever experienced.\"\n\nSurvivors of the Eaton fire in Altadena have raised concerns about possible lead, asbestos and heavy metal contamination in their homes because of smoke.\n\nState Sen. Sasha Ren\u00e9e P\u00e9rez, a Democrat representing Pasadena, in April called on Lara to launch a probe into the alleged mishandling of claims.\n\n\"The survivors of the Los Angeles County fires are experiencing financial and emotional hardships due to State Farm's delays and denials of their valid insurance claims,\" she and other lawmakers said at the time. \"Despite years of faithfully paying premiums, they have been met with excessive documentation demands, denial of claims despite clear evidence, a convoluted and arduous claims process, and silence when seeking help after the disaster.\"\n\nLara said homeowners should file formal complaints regarding State Farm's handling of claims to help the state take action. The Department of Insurance announced a task force last month to recommend best practices for addressing smoke damage.\n\nA wildfire victims advocate praised the investigation as a \"critical step toward accountability.\"\n\n\"State Farm is unjustly denying legitimate smoke damage claims, forcing families already harmed by the Eaton and Palisades fires to make the impossible choice of living in toxic homes or paying tens of thousands out of pocket for remediation. We stand ready to hold State Farm accountable,\" Kiley Grombacher, co-founder of the California Fire Victims Law Center, said in a statement.\n\nInsurers including State Farm had difficulty doing business in California even before the wildfires. In 2023, State Farm and others stopped issuing residential policies because of the wildfire risk.\n\nLast year, Lara unveiled regulations aimed at giving insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for more policies in high-risk areas. State Farm said at the time the company was struggling.\n\nThe wildfires, which destroyed more than 16,000 buildings, made matters even worse.\n\nIn May, state regulators allowed State Farm to raise premiums 17% statewide for its California home insurance customers to help the company rebuild its capital after the costly wildfires.\n\nState Farm initially sought a 22% rate increase for homeowners but revised it down a recent hearing before an administrative judge. The new rates in effect this month include a 38% hike for rental owners and 15% for tenants.\n\nPeople who lost homes in the fires sued in April, alleging State Farm and other insurers colluded to \"suddenly and simultaneously\" drop coverage or halt writing new policies in fire-prone areas, including areas that burned. That left the homeowners underinsured and struggling to rebuild, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest national trade association representing home, auto and business insurers, called the lawsuits meritless, saying it monitors to ensure its members comply with the state's antitrust laws.", "summary": "California's top insurance regulator on Thursday launched an investigation into State Farm over the company's handling of claims from the January Los Angeles-area wildfires.", "url": "https://abc7.com/post/california-insurance-regulator-launches-investigation-state-farm-claims-la-fires/16742638/", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16742686_AP25163710617161.jpg?w=1600", "video": "https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/kfsn/061325-kfsn-mid-state-farm-vid.mp4", "publish_date": "2025-06-13 19:11:20", "author": "Sophie Austin And Mead Gruver", "authors": ["Sophie Austin And Mead Gruver"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.119}]}, {"news": [{"id": 331170070, "title": "Iran retaliates against Israel with missile barrage", "text": "Iran on Friday retaliated against Israel with a missile barrage.

There are four \u2013 that's right, four! \u2013 new films we recommend watching on the world's best streaming services this weekend (June 13 to 15). Admittedly, some of them aren't great but, hey, you can have a laugh with and/or mock them to your heart's content if nothing else.\nFor the small-screen fans among you, there are a couple of new TV show offerings as well.

Not only did it have a disappointing box office run, its terrible 39% Rotten Tomatoes critics score suggests it's not worth investing in at home, either.\n\nStill, while it misses out on being part of our best Disney+ movies round-up, it's now available to watch at home. There are a lot of key differences from the original here, including Snow White's namesake and love interest, which has been met with mixed reviews.\nIf you'd rather watch the original Oscar-winning 1937 movie, that's also streaming on Disney+ alongside plenty of the classics.

After saving her daughter and fellow CIA operative last time around, Arnie's character Luke Brenner is forced to postpone his retirement once more to tackle a new threat. The villain in question? None other than Luke's former flame Greta (played by The Matrix icon Carrie-Anne Moss), which complicates matters a teeny tiny bit.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nFubar isn't part of our best Netflix shows round-up right now, but only because we regularly rotate series in and out of it.

It's about an improv comedy teacher played by Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World: Dominion) who recruits two of her students \u2013 Nick Mohammed (Ted Lasso) and Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings; Pirates of the Caribbean) \u2013 to help her impersonate dangerous criminals for an undercover cop.\nIf that sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably because two of the British crime-comedy caper\u2019s screenwriters (Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly) based theis Amazon film's concept on real-life New York City cops who previously used actors as decoys.\nFollowing its world premiere at SXSW London Screen Festival earlier this month, this Prime Video movie has been received well by critics (based on its Rotten Tomatoes score, anyway). That should be enough to land it a spot on our best Prime Video movies guide, then. \u2013 Amelia Schwanke, senior entertainment editor \n\nWatch Deep Cover on Prime Video\n\nToday's best Amazon Prime deals\n\nAmazon Prime Video - Free Trial\n\nat Amazon Prime\n\nAmazon Prime - Monthly\n\nAmazon Prime - Yearly\n\nEcho Valley (Apple TV+)\n\nEcho Valley \u2014 Official Trailer | Apple TV+ - YouTube\n\nJulianne Moore recently stunned me in Sirens, one of the best Netflix shows, and now she's at the helm of a new Apple TV+ movie Echo Valley.\nThere's a seriously impressive cast here, including Euphoria's Sydney Sweeney, Fallout's Kyle MacLachlan, and Killing Eve's Fiona Shaw. The ensemble is so talented, in fact, I'm going to watch it in spite of its 59% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nThat'll prevent it from joining our best Apple TV+ movies list, but its premise \u2013 Moore plays a mom who helps her troubled daughter (Sweeney) cover up a crime \u2013 is one that appeals to me. \u2013 LB\n\nWatch Echo Valley on Apple TV+\n\nToday's best Apple TV Plus deals\n\nApple TV+ Free Trial\n\nat Apple TV+\n\nApple TV+ - Monthly\n\nat Apple TV+\n\nApple TV Plus MLS - Monthly\n\nat Apple TV+\nCleaner (Max)\n\nCleaner | Official Trailer - YouTube\n\nTwo British action flicks in the same week?

Directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale; Golden Eye), this film, which has debuted on Max, has got a lot of great talent behind it.\nDaisy Ridley (Star Wars; Young Woman and the Sea) stars as an soldier-turned-window cleaner (yes, you read that right), who dusts off her old combat skills to single-handedly save a group of hostages from a radical group of activists that have taken over an energy juggernaut\u2019s gala.\nI know I\u2019m not alone in thinking that this sounds like Die Hard. Countless critics have said as much since reviewing the film (it was released in theaters in the US earlier this year). However, while it follows a tried-and-tested story, its mixed reviews mean it won't make the cut for our best Max movies guide. \u2013 AS\n\nWatch Cleaner on Max\n\nToday's best Max deals\n\nMax Monthly With Ads\n\nat Max - United States\n\nMax Monthly Ad-Free\n\nat Max - United States\n\nMax Monthly Ultimate Ad-Free\n\nat Max - United States\nTitan: The Oceangate Disaster (Netflix)\n\nTITAN: The OceanGate Submersible Disaster | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube\n\nI watched Titan: The OceanGate Disaster very intently and I urge everyone to do the same this weekend. I understand many might be concerned it's just another shocking documentary, but it has a lot of important insights into what actually went wrong, including from those involved in its development.\nFor the uninitiated: in 2023, the submersible vessel known as Titan imploded, resulting in the deaths of all five passengers, including OceanGate's former CEO, Stockton Rush.\nThis well made and, dare I say, essential documentary criticizes how many people's concerns were ignored in the build up to Titan's journey to the Titanic wreckage, and is an important reminder that companies should pay attention to the experts they employ. \u2013 LB\n\nWatch Titan: The Oceangate Disaster on Netflix\nRomcon: Who the F**k is Jason Porter?

Real estate broker Heather Rovet explains how she fell in love with a charismatic handyman called \"Jace\", who she later discovers has been deceiving her. After uncovering the real identity of Jason Porter, a convicted criminal known as a romance scammer, Heather connects with other victims to bring him to justice.\nThis isn't the first dating scammer story we've seen come to streaming, as Netflix's The Tinder Swindler had become a sensation when it was released in 2022.

My how time flies, whether or not you\u2019re having fun. The world is a bit crazy right now.\n\nWar between Ukraine and Russia. Israel hitting targets across Iran, including Tehran. The National Guard and US Marines deployed into Los Angeles during immigration riots. AI possibly undoing multiple industries all at the same time, including mine. The times are . . . interesting, to say the least. Just not in a good way.\n\nOh, and it\u2019s Friday the 13th. What could go wrong?\n\nAt least we have our shows and movies to distract us. A little escapism goes a long ways. As always, I\u2019ve scoured the internet for all the best new content out there this week and put together this friendly neighborhood streaming guide. First, we\u2019ll take a look what\u2019s brand new, then at what series are airing each week. Let\u2019s dive right in!\n\nIf you have any tips or I missed something, shoot me a message on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can check out last weekend\u2019s streaming guide right here.\n\nForbesWhat To Watch This Weekend: New Shows And Movies To Stream On Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Apple TV And MoreBy Erik Kain\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nLarry Ellison $40 Billion Richer \u2014 Surpassing Bezos And Zuckerberg \u2014 As Oracle Stock Mounts Big Rally\n\nFBI Confirms iPhone And Android Warning\u2014Delete All These Texts\n\nIran Launches Retaliatory Strikes Into Israel (Live Updates)\n\nWhat\u2019s New & Notable This Weekend\n\nEcho Valley (Apple TV+)\n\nThis one is interesting because it\u2019s from the creator of HBO\u2019s Mare Of Easttown, which starred Kate Winslet. The new Apple TV+ film follows Julianne Moore\u2019s character\u2014named Kate, oddly enough\u2014whose daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney) shows up with a body in her car and drugs in her system. The thriller has divided critics right down the middle, with a 50% Rotten Tomatoes score. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not even close to the critical acclaim Mare Of Easttown received.\n\nDeep Cover (Prime Video)\n\nThis might be one of, if not the, best-reviewed Prime Video Original movies out there, with a 92% critic score and an 83% audience score. Deep Cover stars Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Mohammed and Orlando Bloom as a trio of improv actors recruited to infiltrate a dangerous crime syndicate in London. I\u2019m getting strong Michael Scarn vibes from this concept, but then everything ties back to The Office in some way or another.\n\nFUBAR \u2014 Season 2 (Netflix)\n\nI think I just watched one, or maybe even just part of one episode of Netflix\u2019s FUBAR when the first season came out a couple years ago. It just didn\u2019t capture me. But if you\u2019re an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan and you like action-comedies, this might be for you. It\u2019s also a fitting Father\u2019s Day show since it\u2019s about a father-daughter spy team, with Monica Barbaro playing Luke\u2019s daughter Emma. Matrix star Carrie-Anne Moss is also joining the cast in Season 2, which is cool. Though I\u2019m also reminded of her brief\u2014dare I say \u201ctotally wasted\u201d\u2014role in Disney\u2019s awful Star Wars series The Acolyte.\n\nTwin Peaks / Twin Peaks: The Return (Mubi)\n\nThe classic surrealist mystery-horror series from Mark Frost and David Lynch debuts on Mubi this week, so if you\u2019ve been itching to watch it again (or for the first time) now you can! Mubi is kind of a cool streaming service also, with a more curated approach to content, which is mostly films though obviously this bucks that trend.\n\nJaws (Peacock)\n\nActually, not only is Jaws coming to Peacock this weekend, but also Jaws 2, Jaws III and Jaws: The Revenge. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure the sequels are even worth mentioning, let alone watching, but the original is a classic, and in many ways the precursor to later films like Jurassic Park. Fun fact: If you subtract the Rotten Tomatoes score of Jaws: The Revenge from the Rotten Tomatoes score of Jaws you get 95%.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon (In Theaters)\n\nI\u2019m still working on my review of How To Train Your Dragon, the live-action remake of the Dreamworks (relatively modern) classic animated film, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it. This is how live-action remakes ought to be, and frankly Disney should take note. Just don\u2019t stick around for the post-credits scene. I was also going to include a Father\u2019s Day movie recommendation in this list, but it occurred to me that this is actually the perfect film for Father\u2019s Day, as protagonist Hiccup and his dad, Stoick the Vast, have a whole lot of family stuff to work out.\n\nWhat\u2019s Streaming Weekly\n\nThere haven\u2019t been too many big finales recently, though lots of shows came to an end a couple weeks ago. Apple TV+\u2019s The Studio and Your Friends & Neighbors ended recently. The Last Of Us Season 2 ended\u2014and saw a massive downturn in ratings. Andor\u2019s second season drew to a close, topping the Nielsen streaming charts the week of its finale. Other shows have cropped up to take their place.\n\nResident Alien \u2014 Season 4 (SyFy)\n\nThis came out last week on cable TV, but only drops on Peacock this weekend. That\u2019s an annoying gap for those of us who cut our cables many years ago. Alan Tudyk is brilliant in this alien dramedy, though I have yet to dive into Season 4. It\u2019s a very goofy, very heartfelt series and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\n\nStick (Apple TV+)\n\nOwen Wilson stars as washed out golfer who gets a shot at redemption in this feel-good dramedy. It\u2019s not getting the kind of reviews a lot of similar shows on Apple TV+ generally get, so don\u2019t expect another Ted Lasso or Shrinking, but Wilson is a charming lead and if you\u2019re looking for something a bit lighter this weekend, give it a shot.\n\nBMF \u2014 Season 4 (Starz)\n\nI hadn\u2019t even heard about BMF until its fourth season came out, probably because BMF is a terrible name for a TV show. It stands for Black Mafia Family (and Black Mafia would have been a way better title for the series) and is based on true stories about the rise of a powerful gang back in 80s Detroit. I ended up watching the first couple episodes of Season 1 and it\u2019s pretty good. People say it\u2019s a \u201cblack Sopranos\u201d but it\u2019s really not on the same level as that masterpiece. Still, I\u2019m interested in seeing where it goes.\n\nDeath Valley (BritBox)\n\nI\u2019ve been binging the first season of The Shield on Hulu since I somehow never watched it when it was coming out (oh yeah, I was broke and didn\u2019t have cable TV!) and really enjoying it, which has also stopped me from diving into this comedic mystery starring the great character actor Timothy Spall. It\u2019s on my list, however, as I like nothing more than cozy British mysteries.\n\nDuster (HBO)\n\nI wrote not long ago that HBO\u2019s new 1970s Arizona crime series Duster has an identity crisis. I stand by that assessment while adding this caveat: It\u2019s currently one of my guilty pleasures. It\u2019s far from perfect, but Josh Holloway is a charming lead and I just love the time period and the fact that this takes place in my home state, and that in almost every episode my hometown of Flagstaff has been name-dropped. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\n\nMurderbot (Apple TV+)\n\nAlexander Skarsgard is terrific as the titular Murderbot in Apple TV+\u2019s latest comedy sci-fi series, Murderbot, based on the books by Martha Wells. The rest of the show is a little more hit-or-miss, ranging from genuinely funny to somewhat cringe. I had a lot of fun in the end, but it takes awhile to get to the good stuff, and Apple\u2019s weekly release format doesn\u2019t work well here, especially since every episode is so short. Read my review here.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Dead City \u2014 Season 2 (AMC+)\n\nI finally caught up on The Walking Dead: Dead City and now there\u2019s a new episode coming out. I assumed it would only be six episodes this season, but it\u2019s eight, and I\u2019m honestly not sure how I\u2019m going to suffer through the next two. It\u2019s quite terrible and bland with some genuinely goofy moments that weren\u2019t meant to be played for laughs. This whole franchise needs to take a break, get new people in leadership and writing, and start over a few years down the road.\n\nForbesEverything Coming To Netflix In June: New Releases And What To WatchBy Erik Kain\n\nWhat else did I miss?

That response will definitely come.\u201d\n\nThe apparent setback in nuclear talks came after the Trump administration said Thursday evening that it still hoped to send the special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, to Oman this weekend for a sixth round of nuclear talks with Iran.\n\nFor years, U.S. officials have raised fears about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, leading past presidents to attempt negotiations, issue ominous warnings, and even make controversial deals with the regime in an effort to decapacitate such threats, as the Obama administration did. \n\nWhen Hamas launched an attack on Israel and killed roughly 1,200 civilians during the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, concerns about Iran again rose to the forefront due to the country\u2019s deep connections to the terrorist group. \n\nAlthough some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pressed the Trump administration to directly bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and take out terrorists in the country, as Israel chose to do, the president resisted pressure to do so, opting instead to mount a diplomatic pressure campaign designed to avert warfare. \n\nDetailed in a national security memorandum released in February, the White House has followed a policy of \u201cimposing maximum pressure\u201d on Iran as part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader strategy to isolate Iran politically and economically to keep it from building a nuclear weapon. \n\nTrump said in the early spring that he was running \u201ca campaign of pressure\u201d to negotiate a new deal. He \u201creally wants peace\u201d but Iran cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, Trump said. The president also sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in March saying: \u201cI hope you\u2019re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we could solve this problem without warfare,\u201d Trump said,\u201d It would be a tremendous thing.\u201d\n\nIn April, the White House revealed Iran had agreed to embark on nuclear negotiations with the U.S. \n\nAt the time, Trump gave Iran 60 days to reach a deal on its nuclear program, warning of \u201cmore dire consequences\u201d if an agreement was not reached.\n\n The 60-day mark came and passed without a deal from Iran on June 12, the day before Israel launched strikes on the country\u2019s nuclear facilities. \n\nOn Friday morning, Trump suggested that Iran might be willing to give negotiations a second chance to avoid an all-out war with Israel. \n\n\u201cTwo months ago I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to \u2018make a deal,\u201d he said in a post to Truth Social. They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn\u2019t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\u201d\n\nThe primary factor stalling an agreement is Iran\u2019s refusal to agree to stop its domestic uranium enrichment program, which can be used to generate nuclear energy to build a bomb.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog passed a resolution declaring Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in two decades. The IAEA Board of Governors concluded that Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment has reached 60% purity, steps away from the weapons-grade purity level of 90%.\n\n \u201cA country enriching at 60% is a very serious thing. Only countries making bombs are reaching this level,\u201d IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in 2021. \n\nAn Israeli military official told the BBC that Iran had enough nuclear material to create nuclear bombs \u201cwithin days\u201d.\n\nThat belief spurred Israel\u2019s military operation against Iran on Friday morning, which could crush the Trump administration\u2019s goal of sealing an agreement with the Ayatollah. \n\n\u201cOperation Rising Lion,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, seeks to \u201croll back the Iranian threat to Israel\u2019s very survival.\u201d\n\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said during televised remarks that intelligence officials had uncovered an Iranian \u201cplan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years\u201d saying the Ayatollah\u2019s regime is \u201cracing towards a nuclear bomb.\u201d", "summary": "Iran will no longer engage in nuclear talks with the United States, state media reported.

President Donald Trump does: He is overseeing a lavish military parade Saturday in Washington, D.C., ostensibly to celebrate Flag Day and the Army's 250th birthday. But the event comes amid a Trump-ordered National Guard deployment in Los Angeles, and critics see something dark at play in Trump's celebration.\n\nReactions to the parade are divided between those who see it as a \"stirring moment of patriotism\" and others calling it an \"alarming echo of authoritarianism,\" said USA Today. Trump originally wanted to throw a military parade during his first term after watching Bastille Day celebrations in 2017. Pentagon leaders resisted him then. Not now. The procession will include at least \"28 Abrams tanks thundering up Constitution Avenue\" as well as \"50 military helicopters thumping overhead.\" All of this happens, incidentally, on Trump's 79th birthday. It is \"amazing the way things work out,\" Trump said last month.\n'Display of jingoism'\nTrump's parade \"perfectly distills his presidency,\" Zeeshan Aleem said at MSNBC. The procession of military equipment on Constitution Avenue is a \"wasteful, infrastructure-destroying display of jingoism\" with an authoritarian vibe \"far closer to a Russian military parade than a Bastille Day celebration.\" The estimated $45 million cost of the parade comes as the president and his DOGE workers \"take a chainsaw to agencies that deliver Social Security, tax revenue and foreign aid.\" It's typical of a term defined by \"baldly despotic stunts and policies.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

In democracies, the military is an \"instrument of national defense, serving the people.\" In authoritarian countries, the armed forces are a \"weapon the government wields against its own citizens.\" The question this week, amid deployments in Los Angeles, is whether America has \"crossed a dangerous line in that regard.\"\n\nCelebrating the Army's achievements?\n\"Sometimes a parade is just a parade,\" Kori Schake said at The Atlantic. Showcasing the American military should be a \"patriotic celebration\" and the Trump administration's actions are not always \"destructive to democracy.\" Instead, the parade could \"bring Americans closer to service members and juice military recruitment.\" That would help American armed services in the midst of a recruiting crisis. Hopefully Trump's parade will \"draw talented young Americans to serve.\"\nArmy veterans are \"divided\" over the parade, said The Associated Press. Some vets see the event as \"chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea\" while others view it as a \"once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements.\" In any case, it appears most GOP members of Congress will not attend, said Politico. Some are openly skeptical, while others say they are simply busy. \"I just didn't get to go home last week,\" said House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole.\nThere will be counterprotests across the country. The \"No Kings Day\" events organized by more than 100 \"pro-democracy groups\" are expected to be the \"largest single-day anti-President Trump rally since the start of his second administration,\" said Axios. Trump is not interested. Any protests at the Army parade, he said Tuesday, will face \"very heavy force.\" Other complications could ensue: Forecasters say it might rain in Washington, D.C. on Saturday.\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\nWashington DC\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day \u2013 and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJoel Mathis, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nJoel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

Tim Walz, D-Minn., is hoping for rain on Saturday during President Donald Trump's military parade. During a \"What\u2019s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward\" event hosted by the Center for American Progress (CAP), Walz told CEO Neera Tanden that he had never hoped for rain so much in his life. \"I'm just going to confess to it,\" Walz said. \"It might get me in trouble. Whatever. I have never so hoped for rain in my life.\" Trump is hosting a massive Flag Day military parade on Saturday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to gather in the nation\u2019s capital to witness the historic parade, which also coincides with the president's 79th birthday. TIM WALZ FLOATS CHINA AS 'NEUTRAL ACTOR' WITH 'MORAL AUTHORITY' TO NEGOTIATE MIDDLE EAST PEACE According to the FOX Forecast Center's Risk Of Weather Impact (ROWI) assessment, there is a medium risk of inclement weather in the nation's capital, with showers and thunderstorms expected throughout part of the evening. And Walz is hoping for that perfect storm. PROTESTERS EXPECTED TO CONVERGE ON DC, NEIGHBORING CITIES AHEAD OF TRUMP'S MILITARY PARADE The Democrat, who rose to the national stage as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during her brief 2024 presidential campaign, criticized Trump along his usual attack lines on Friday. Walz said Trump is \"incompetent at governing,\" and America is in a \"dangerous time\" under Trump's leadership, which the Minnesota governor said is \"marching towards authoritarianism\" following the chaotic incident in which authorities forcibly removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference Thursday. The Democrat confirmed on Friday that he will be speaking at a \"No Kings\" protest in St. Paul, Minn., this Saturday during Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C. \"Somehow this got tied to billionaires in China funding this or whatever,\" Walz said Friday. \"I'm like, these are like people in St. Paul that just do protests and stuff. That's what they do. They're feeling it, and they organized it. I think going and making that case, it is a good counter.\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., grilled Walz about attending the protest during a House Oversight Committee hearing with his fellow \"sanctuary governors\" on Capitol Hill Thursday. Luna said DHS discovered that China considered Walz a \"prime target for influence operations.\" \"You are working with, and going to be speaking at, an organization and rally that is not just funded by Christy Walton, the heiress of Walmart, but also has ties to the Chinese Progressive Association largely funding it, that actually brags on their website that they are pro-Maoist,\" Luna said. But Walz dismissed Luna's allegations, doubling down that Trump's military parade \"just looks wrong, feels wrong.\" \"I think I'm going to go be with a few thousand folks who kind of have the tradition that there is a separation there, that we don't need this. This is not Pyongyang on a Saturday,\" Walz said, before admitting he was hoping for rain. Pyongyang is the capital of North Korea, which is a communist, totalitarian dictatorship. Walz has joined many Democrats, including those planning to protest on Saturday, who have criticized Trump's military parade, drawing comparisons to China's and North Korea's military parades.

After calling up prospect Jacob Misiorowski, the Brewers moved Civale to the bullpen. He requested a trade, as he had been one of the Crew\u2019s top starters this season. Without hesitating, Milwaukee sent him to the White Sox for a former top prospect in Vaughn. How did both sides fare in this deal?\nCivale was traded from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Brewers before last year\u2019s MLB trade deadline. In 19 starts with Milwaukee, he posted a 3.84 ERA and went 7-5. He made only one playoff appearance for the Crew, closing out a Game 1 loss to the New York Mets in the NL Wild Card Round. He threw three scoreless innings.\nVaughn has been one of the worst players in baseball this year, sporting a -1.3 fWAR. That is tied for the worst in all of baseball with Angels infielder Luis Rengifo. He plays first base, which is manned in Milwaukee by Rhys Hoskins. They are betting on talent, hoping he can provide a spark to their offense.\nThe White Sox grab a high-ceiling starter in a lost season\nKatie Stratman-Imagn Images\nThe White Sox are flying under the radar while the Colorado Rockies challenge their single-season loss record. Despite a current win-loss pace of 54-108, they aren\u2019t the butt of jokes like they were last year. They traded Garrett Crochet this offseason, but have still gotten decent starting pitching. They added to that by picking up Civale while dumping a player they were getting nothing from.\nThe White Sox just need bodies who can pitch to get through this season. That is exactly what Civale is, and he could help them win some games. The MLB trade deadline is still weeks away, and Civale\u2019s contract is expiring at the end of this season. A contender could call Chicago asking for Civale, which they should not shut down. This could be a long road to adding more prospects to their pipeline.\nWhite Sox grade: B+\nThe Brewers part ways almost immediately\nA player asking for a trade is always an awkward situation. To add insult to injury, Thursday was Civale\u2019s birthday. So it is understandable why the Brewers wasted no time sending Civale to what he believed was a better situation. But the return is underwhelming, to say the least. Despite being the third overall pick in 2019, Vaughn has never shown elite MLB offensive talent.\nThe Brewers still could trade pitchers ahead of the deadline, as many of their starters are still injured. If Brandon Woodruff and Nestor Cortes do come back, that could lead to Freddy Peralta getting shipped out. Every contender needs starters, and the Brewers have an incredible surplus. With prospects from the Corbin Burnes and Devin Williams trade not clicking yet, they may consider trying again in the trade market.\nIf the Brewers can get something out of Vaughn, this will be a worthy trade. They were going to trade Civale anyway, so helping the 2025 squad is not a bad strategy. But if Vaughn continues his poor form and the deadline ends up as a seller\u2019s market, the Brewers may regret pulling the trigger so quickly.\nThis is going to be a poor grade for the Brewers now, but some extra credit could get the professor to reconsider.\nBrewers grade: C", "summary": "The Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox made a trade on Friday morning, swapping Aaron Civale and Andrew Vaughn.

The New York Post was first to report the news.\n\nThey shipped off struggling first baseman Andrew Vaughn, who had been demoted to Triple-A Charlotte.\n\nCivale, 30, is likely to be in the Sox\u2019 rotation. He has a 4.91 ERA in 22 innings in five starts this season. He requested a trade from the Brewers after they removed him from the rotation to make room for prospect Jacob Misiorowski.\n\nCivale is familiar with the American League Central, having pitched five years for the Guardians. He gives the team a veteran with a proven track record. With the Sox\u2019 inexperienced rotation, the move was necessary to help manage their starters\u2019 workloads. \n\nManager Will Venable said Thursday that the Sox don\u2019t have a clear timetable on right-hander Jonathan Cannon\u2019s return. Adding Civale is a short-term fix for the pitching staff. \n\nThe trade ends Vaughn\u2019s tenure in Chicago. He never materialized into the power-hitting, run-producing first baseman the club envisioned when he was selected with the No. 3 pick in the 2019 MLB Draft.\n\nVaughn remained consistent throughout his first four major-league seasons before he hit bottom this season. Vaughn batted .189/.218/.314 in 48 games for the Sox. According to Baseball-Reference, he had a -1.6 WAR. In 610 career games, Vaughn slashed .248/.303/.407 with 77 home runs and 293 RBI. \n\nVaughn \u2014 like center fielder Luis Robert Jr. and former Sox players Michael Kopech, Yoan Moncada and Eloy Jimenez \u2014 never quite reached his potential on the South Side.\n\nAs an undersized first baseman, Vaughn had to be productive at the plate because he didn\u2019t offer any defensive value. The club demoted him to the minors, hoping to improve his command of the strike zone, but Vaughn batted only .211/.328/.351 at Triple-A.\n\nTim Elko has struggled since in two separate stints in the majors. He\u2019s batting .155/.222/.379 in 18 games. With Vaughn out of the organization, Elko will receive the majority of the first-base reps.
