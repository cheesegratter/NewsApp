A co-op action RPG battle royale hybrid set in the Elden Ring universe\nRelease date May 30, 2025\nExpect to pay $40/\u00a335\nDeveloper FromSoftware\nPublisher Bandai Namco\nReviewed on RTX 5090, Intel Core i9 12900K, 16GB RAM\nMultiplayer Yes\nSteam Deck Untested\nLink Official site\nIn the fight against Elden Ring Nightreign's riff on Mothra, I never expected it would eventually touch down and mount the head of its partner, a giant stick bug with claws, like a mech. For the rest of the fight they were operating in unison, a kaiju cowboy with orbital lasers piercing the sky. That's a problem pesticide can't solve, but, as it turns out, three guys with bows absolutely can.\n\nThere's nothing like fighting a boss in a FromSoftware game that is designed to be a joke with you as the punchline\u2014and defying fate with your own ridiculous strategy. Elden Ring Nightreign is a game about losing a fistfight over and over until you luck or strategize your way into an opportunity to bring three guns. The harder you've been hit the more glorious the payback, and Nightreign is a merciless bully.\nEven if you've played Elden Ring, Nightreign will surprise you. Imagine the Lands Between as a stadium filled with familiar monsters and a team of three players as its contestants. It's an action RPG as a sport, cranked up to two times speed, and designed to be replayed every 30 minutes. Randomized loot and an ever-tightening battle royale-style circle apply constant pressure that you're only released from at the end of the match, whether you survive or not.\n\nYou may like\n\nElden Ring Nightreign's story is told in part through playable memories, so FromSoftware really is delivering lore through whacking things\n\nThe First Berserker: Khazan review \u2013 Smart soulslike combat and boss design despite somewhat samey missions\n\nElden Ring Nightreign PC performance analysis: A bare-bones console port with glitches a-plenty\n\nNightreign is the most peculiar game FromSoft has made since the '90s. It's also its most abrasive.\n\nEven now after putting well over 30 hours into it, I believe Nightreign is both a trend-defying remix of Elden Ring and also a pile of complete bullshit that I shouldn't have to deal with in the year 2025.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)\n\nDropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods\nI can't help but respect the fact that it works, however. Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods, and yet that is exactly what I've been doing in Nightreign. We've been \"looting churches,\" \"clearing camps,\" and \"popping crab\" for the past week. Some of my most heated, frustrating moments\u2014like when a boss \"invaded\" my run to steal entire levels from me before peacing out\u2014were cooled by the fact that I was palling around Elden Ring like it was Fortnite.\nThere were also plenty of times I was convinced that maybe Nightreign is actually a terrible idea. Elden Ring didn't need a time limit, nor did it need a randomized loot system. The randomization often feels designed\u2014or under-designed\u2014just to screw you over. There's a difference between mistiming a dodge on a fatal attack and spending 10 minutes on a grueling boss fight because the map refused to cough up a holy weapon for a boss who is weak to holy. This game has optional events where you can spend half of a run fighting for a bonus reward that will be irrelevant to the final boss you've targeted for that session\u2014or any boss for that matter. And the ability to meaningfully buildcraft is in constant tension with Nightreign's pace and its UI, which obfuscates key information around damage scaling and weapon abilities.\nDo you know the difference between Dragon Communion Incantations and Dragon Cult Incantations? I don't either, but you have five seconds to figure it out before the circle consumes you.\nNightreign is kind of a mess. FromSoftware's inscrutable terminology and uneven balance makes the learning curve much steeper than it needs to be. Or maybe that's the beauty of it: A game not trying to entice you with daily login bonuses or battle passes, but a language to learn over the course of hundreds of runs. In that way, it emulates the joys of gaining acuity with any of the studio's other games. But that might also be why the structure of Nightreign falls apart for me.\nIf you hated running back to a boss in Elden Ring, try doing that with a whole-ass battle royale to survive on the way there.\nIt's hard to enjoy the journey when the destination is the only thing you're meaningfully rewarded for. Each character in Nightreign can equip three Relics with passive benefits that range from unnoticeable (dexterity +2) to game-changing (item effects or healing flasks are shared with all players). Most of them are trash and will have little to no bearing on whether or not you can kill the final boss, let alone reach them. But that's all that you get to take home after each run.\nBuild-brained\n\nNightreign's major bosses tend to be extremely mobile, so get ready to sprint a lot. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)\nNightreign wants you in it for the love of the game, and while I can appreciate that in a sea of games that practically bribe you to keep playing, it can also make the routine moments of a run kind of boring. Elden Ring has its punishing sections, but there's always something else to do. In Nightreign, you just fight bosses until you're strong enough to fight a different boss. When my team cut down the final one, I couldn't think of many reasons compelling me to do it all over again.\nBut later, I watched a recording of the fight and saw that the final sliver of health on a boss we'd attempted at least six times was extinguished by the tiny magical daggers summoned by my sword's passive effect. And that's when the gears started turning.\nWhat if I found that weapon again and actually played the right character with the right items to emphasize that technique? What other effects have I ignored that could inspire entirely new strategies? I immediately wanted to go for another run as an experiment.\n\nA rare, precious item allowing you to revive once after death. Good luck getting one. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)\n\nYou get better at knowing what locations to hit each night, but if the drops don't serve you, the run can go sour quickly.\nUh oh. It's possible Nightreign rules, actually.\nThe combinations of weapons and effects you can put together in a run frequently activate my \"RPG build\" neurons. Part of the reason we even made it to the point where the final boss was nine magic glintblades away from death is that I discovered the \"successive attacks negate damage\" passive effect. On most of Nightreign's eight playable characters it's hard to activate, but it naturally synergizes with the dual-wielding knife specialist Duchess' playstyle. Though she's normally one of the squishiest nightfarers, a flurry of stabs into a boss and I could tank an attack that would take my teammates out in one hit. Paired with a Relic that automatically activates her skill to repeat damage done to a boss after landing several hits in a row and I was playing an immortal god. The problem is you won't find those buffs every run\u2014or on the right character.\nBut when you do, the thrill of having that kind of power in a FromSoft game is delicious, especially when the difficulty is as brutal as Nightreign's. The RNG of it all and the number of bosses standing between you and the end demands a high level of execution and, frankly, luck. You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night, but if the drops don't serve you, the run can go sour quickly.\nIn Fortnite, the odds are stacked against you. One hundred players enter a match and only one comes out a winner. In Nightreign the odds are the same, except most of the time the game wins. This feels backwards to how I've always approached FromSoft games, but the elation of finally getting a win can be tantalizing. And that's all it takes to pull me back in. It doesn't matter whether it's a silly weapon I want to try again or a different character I want to learn, like the witch who can yank magic out of enemies to buff her allies. Every time I get a taste of victory, I forget the misery of spending 30 minutes to lose to a boss and hit the button to do it again anyway.\nBrutal but brilliant\n\nLucking into a great weapon drop can make all the struggle feel worth it. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)\n\nWhen the stars align\u2014and they will\u2014Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played\nAll of Nightreign's faults fade when the brutal difficulty and the randomized nature of it creates something beautiful, like when you discover the skeletons summoned by the little necromancer girl can revive you when you're downed.\nOr when you're fighting a jellyfish god from another planet and your buddy in Skyrim armor screams as he rises into the sky on a giant rock, saving you from a big attack.\nOr when you're low on healing flasks and praying for an easy boss and out from the dark portal steps a nightmare from an entirely different game, one you thought you'd never have to face again. Sometimes Nightreign is so cruel all you can do is laugh as it shoves your nose in the dirt.\nBut then it turns around and delivers catharsis. Everyone cheered in voice chat when Centipede Demon, the boss nobody remembers from Dark Souls, showed up to get obliterated by 14 years of action RPG combat advancement. When the stars align\u2014and they will\u2014Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played.\nI just wish it wasn't so hard to play\u2014not because the bosses are tough, but because of how indifferent it is to helping you experience everything that's so endearing about it. All the work is on you to find something that draws you back in, to find a reason to try again. For me that's a new build or a new character to focus on with a game-changing Relic setup. For others it can be helping out a friend struggling with the brutal difficulty. And for something as experimental and as weird as Nightreign is, that might be enough.\nNightreign is light on story, but it carries with it my favorite theme core to all of FromSoft's games: The irresistible nature to persevere against what feels like impossible odds. That I can spend three hours getting pummeled by a game as impenetrable as this and still feel the urge to give it another go has me annoyed that the same trick's working on me again.\nNightreign may be kind of a mess, but it's a mess made just for me.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nRead our review policy \n\nElden Ring: Nightreign\n\nElden Ring Nightreign is just as confusing and abrasive as FromSoftware's other games, but there's really nothing else like it.\n\nFromSoftware\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nTyler has covered videogames and PC hardware for 15 years.

From the deepest mines to the highest snow-capped peaks, we clashed and slew monstrous beasts for two in-game days at a breakneck pace to stay ahead of the closing ring of blue flame. On the third day, confronting the Nightlord in its lair, we get close to defeating it with wild weapons and spells -- but win or lose, we shrug and queue up to drop once more.\n\nThis is Elden Ring Nightreign, a spin-off of studio FromSoftware's phenomenally successful and notoriously difficult fantasy action-RPG game Elden Ring. Rather than spend dozens of hours exploring wide lands in a solo adventure, Nightreign takes the combat and boss structure to a co-op multiplayer setting where tight gameplay must be balanced against speed and strategy to survive each trip into the game's arena. \n\nNightreign is a departure for FromSoftware, eschewing the slow solo explorations of its previous games in favor of fast-paced rounds building your heroes from scratch, kind of similar to battle royale shooters like Fortnite and Apex Legends. But unlike those PvP-intensive games, each Nightreign round pits the friendly squad against a map full of computer-controlled enemies, leaving players dependent on teammates to survive -- or themselves, if they're bold enough for a solo run. (Currently, players can either go it alone or queue for three-player squads.)\n\nNightreign is focused, repeatable Soulslike action \n\nNightreign ambitiously tries to see how much of an idiosyncratic yet popular game can be slimmed down and imported into a new gameplay loop. It's easy to put a hundred hours or more into Elden Ring, exploring every nook and cranny, upgrading weapons and trying out different strategies. Nightreign punishes that slow pace, requiring squads to blitz around the map, hitting specific points of interest to get as strong as they can to survive and defeat the big boss at the end of each three-day run. (Playing through three in-game days and facing the Nightlord boss at the end of a run can take 45 minutes to an hour -- or less, if you die along the way.)\n\nThis approach will be catnip for fans of FromSoftware's signature tough boss combat, as it distills Elden Ring down to its core combat loop with just enough randomized surprises to somewhat refresh each run while keeping enough the same to quickly plan and alter course along a run. That makes sense, as Nightreign is directed by Junya Ishizaki, the person in charge of overseeing the combat for Elden Ring. \n\nOn the surface, a lot has carried over from Elden Ring, but there are plenty of subtle refinements to make it fit fast-paced multiplayer gameplay. Player characters kit themselves out with powerful weapons and spells without worrying about stat requirements or armor. There's no fall damage, allowing players to drop from great heights to keep moving, and spirit hawks lift them in aerial routes around the map. Running up to a spiritual spring of blue fire lets you leap upward hundreds of feet in an invigorating ascent with a heavy bass sound effect -- I breeze around the map feeling fast and powerful, a hunter in a forsaken land.\n\nBut there is some part of FromSoftware's spirit that's lost in Nightreign: that feeling of being dwarfed by an alien world that slowly unfolds its mysterious history as you cut your way through its cursed remains. Instead, Nightreign leans heavily on the mystique and lore built up in Elden Ring, presenting a mirror version of that well-known setting with its own limited mythology that can be revealed with optional missions. But you can just stick with the gameplay loop, and many will, turning Nightreign into a greatest hits album of fun FromSoftware moments that doesn't introduce too much that's new -- beyond designing the game around persistent squad multiplayer.\n\nAnd the multiplayer is a joy, despite rough edges that, in true FromSoftware fashion, are unexplained or buggy in ways that the community will likely fondly rehabilitate as part of the game's charm. For instance, the game requires a lot of ascending big plateaus by hopping up misshapen steps with erratically successful ledge grabs. It's minorly frustrating, but does ratchet up the tension when you're trying to escape death or rush to a teammate's aid -- and much like the rest of FromSoftware's games, Nightreign is so tightly polished elsewhere that this slight jank, or other aspects like it, is tolerated and treated as part of its difficulty and flavor.\n\nWhich is all to say that, for $40, Nightreign delivers on its vision of concentrated, easily repeatable FromSoftware action that's sure to hook the studio's die-hard fans and potentially lure other difficulty junkies who prefer quick multiplayer romps to lore-heavy solo adventures. With rogue-like novelty that rewards replaying, there's a decent blend of familiar elements and shifting map factors for fans of FromSoftware's tough gameplay to get their fix without needing to replay games they know so well.\n\nFans of the longevity of Elden Ring and its DLC Shadows of the Erdtree should be cautioned: On top of a more narrow appeal than prior FromSoftware games, players will vary in how much replay value they'll get out of Nightreign, since there's currently only one map and a finite number of end-run bosses to tackle. The eight character classes, called Nightfarers, have varying complexity in their ability mechanics and will take players a while to master, but they'll likely spend most of their time attacking with weapons and dodging enemy blows, as in Elden Ring.\n\nThere are plenty of randomized factors that mix up a run, from shifting terrain opening up new areas to \"invasions\" of powerful enemy computer-controlled Nightfarers. But in the 20 hours it took me to beat half the end-run bosses and kill the final boss, the single map became such a known entity that I stopped paying attention to it as anything but a race course to speed over on the way to my next task.\n\nWhere Elden Ring Nightreign triumphs and falters\n\nAs a FromSoftware fan who can muck his way through its games in ways that nobody would describe as \"dominant,\" Nightreign is something of a relief, as my two permanent teammates can help a lot in distracting bosses and picking me up when I make mistakes. \n\nThanks to previewing the game earlier this year, I hit the ground running, pairing up with CNET teammates to try taking on big bosses -- and failing. But after pairing up with a very skilled Bandai Namco employee (one of many who volunteered to help reviewers like me take on bosses and finish the game), we took down some of the biggest and baddest Nightreign has to offer. \n\nThere's no mistaking that I was carried by more skilled teammates, and that has me concerned for a bit of the game's flow and player skill growth. While I was used to cautiously and slowly going through FromSoftware games, my more skilled teammates flung us outbound on a speedy tour of the map zones we needed to hit to get as strong as we could. When I fell, they tanked bosses and dodged attacks to revive me. When the map's Shifting Earth conditions led to a new area, my expert teammate took us to the exact right spot to take full advantage of it -- something that might have taken plenty more runs to figure out on my own.\n\nI certainly improved over time, but it was all during rounds -- in the Roundtable hub, players return to between missions, a Sparring Grounds area lets you try out each of the eight total (six starting, two unlockable) Nightfarers' regular and ultimate skills, along with every weapon in the game. But it's a far cry from the game's high-pressure situations of boss events, enemy groups and more. Players will improve only by trial and error in the field, sometimes letting down their teammates in the process.\n\nYet, when you and your team are firing on all cylinders, there's no thrill like eking out a win over a monstrous boss. After killing a trio of end-run bosses, another reviewer, Bandai Namco employee Micah (team Cat Password all the way) and I locked in to beat the game's final boss. Shouting out congratulations over team chat, my body shaking with adrenaline, I felt like I'd completed a gaming feat -- something not unknown to many Elden Ring players after surmounting one of that game's many challenging bosses. \n\nI felt accomplished. I wanted to tell everyone, and when the game comes out, bring my friends in to play Nightreign with them, guiding as I was guided. But would I recommend my FromSoftware newcomer friends to play?\n\nWho is Elden Ring Nightreign for?\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I felt my dozens of hours in Elden Ring were essential to starting Nightreign strong -- and even then, it took 20 hours in Nightreign to feel like I'd gotten a good handle on the best way to play. Knowing Elden Ring's massive arsenal of weapons and spells felt essential to picking up Nightreign and immediately having fun.\n\nNew players who don't have baked-in knowledge of Elden Ring or the combat flow of FromSoftware games will probably be left in the cold. Aside from a tutorial section teaching players basic mechanics, Nightreign lacks the carefully crafted early sections of the studio's other games -- it quite literally drops players into the map for a run and tells them to get killing. \n\nThe virtue of FromSoftware's single-player adventures' difficulties is that players could approach them at their own pace; in Nightreign, they must rapidly adapt to the studio's particular flavor of tough combat while also figuring out a largely unexplained world. The studio's famed minimalist storytelling will likely do a disservice to new players who die too quickly to learn.\n\nWhether they continue with the game after a humiliating defeat is, indeed, the classic trial that every FromSoftware player faces. But it sure seems like new players have a high hill to climb picking up on the game's subtly conveyed details -- map flow, enemy camps, bosses, weapons, churches, strategies -- while also figuring out how to play Soulslikes from scratch. \n\nAnd yet, Nightreign is so unlike every other game out there that its sheer novelty may be enough to tempt FromSoftware veterans and newcomers alike. It's polished, is easy to get into the action and has a very high skill ceiling. If players stick through its lack of direction and difficulty, they'll find a multiplayer game that feels rewarding to win in a way few other games are. And when they lose, they may find themselves like I did -- nursing annoyance that they fumbled but eager to drop in one more time with their trusted squad.", "summary": "FromSoftware's first multiplayer game is as tough as its oeuvre, sure to please longtime fans and test new ones.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-review-an-addicting-multiplayer-roguelike-for-challenge-junkies/", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/f1a6e82d4d71a0b53ee34387320cb0ee97686d40/hub/2024/12/13/6a06f459-b8ae-43ee-8daa-9ece2b19a8d2/elden-ring-nightreign.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 14:00:03", "author": "David Lumb", "authors": ["David Lumb"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.553}, {"id": 325791060, "title": "FromSoftware nerfed bleed and frost in Elden Ring Nightreign after players proved they were \"way too strong,\" and it's also worked on \"menus and UI and onboarding\"", "text": "Skip to main content\n\nGamesRadar+\n\nGamesRadar+\n\nGamesRadar+ The Games, Movies, TV & Comics You Love\n\nSearch GamesRadar+\n\nView Profile\n\nXbox Series X\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nNintendo Switch 2\n\nTabletop Gaming\n\nToys & Collectibles\n\nRetro Gamer\n\nNewsletters\n\nTotal Film \n\nGaming Magazines\n\nWhy subscribe?\n\nSubscribe from just \u00a33\nTakes you closer to the games, movies and TV you love\nTry a single issue or save on a subscription\nIssues delivered straight to your door or device\n\n From\u00a39.99View\n\nSummer Game Fest schedule 2025\n\nNew games 2025\nUpcoming Switch 2 games\n\nRecommended reading\n\nAction RPGs\nFromSoftware had to adjust the difficulty in Elden Ring Nightreign after the beta to make sure it's \"challenging as you progress, but still manageable,\" and yes, some things are harder now\n\nAction RPGs\nWith just days to go, Elden Ring Nightreign director says it's \"equal parts nerves and excitement\" as FromSoftware polishes game balance \"until the last minute\"\n\nAction RPGs\nElden Ring Nightreign leads say FromSoftware is bracing servers for launch and working to \"improve our multiplayer game\" \u2013 \"In the worst case, we want players to be able to keep playing\"\n\nFromSoftware warns \"the same strategy won't always work\" in Elden Ring Nightreign, which is bad news for me because I used the same strategy in all the Souls games \n\nAction RPGs\nThe director of Elden Ring Nightreign has been thinking about this game since Dark Souls 3, and \"seeing the scope of Elden Ring\" finally made it click in his mind \n\nAction RPGs\nIn 15 hours, Elden Ring Nightreign beta players managed to beat the Day 3 boss over 58k times, which sounds pretty good until you hear about the 38 billion runes lost\n\nAction RPGs\nElden Ring Nightreign: Everything we know so far\n\nAction RPGs\n\nElden Ring Nightreign\n\nFromSoftware nerfed bleed and frost in Elden Ring Nightreign after players proved they were \"way too strong,\" and it's also worked on \"menus and UI and onboarding\"\n\nAustin Wood \n\n28 May 2025\n\n\"We have to figure out these many different methods of attack and many variations of players\" \n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

I'd wager they'll still be quite strong in the live game, just a bit less potent after these changes.\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nIshizaki said they have also been working on \"menus and UI and onboarding.

Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign is a tough sell. Breaking away from the 'soulsborne' formula FromSoftware established with Dark Souls and Bloodborne by forcing it into a roguelike shape with hero shooter-style characters, it's certainly a departure. One that I was sceptical of at first, appearing like an odd attempt to muscle in on the success of games like Hades 2 and the financial gains to be made from the live service scene, dressed up as an elaborate boss rush mod for Elden Ring.\n\nEven in my first couple of hours playing, I wasn't completely sure of Elden Ring Nightreign's premise: team up with two other players, pick from one of eight Nightfarer characters, then run through a three-day Expedition, killing enemies to collect runes, weapons, and boons to help you overcome one big bad boss at the end. But after eventually beating the game's first Night Lord, the three-headed hell-wolf Gladius, by quite literally snatching victory from three sets of jaws of defeat, I was eager to take on the rest.\nElden Ring Nightreign is certainly an odd game, and one that will mainly appeal to only the most hardcore of Elden Ring fans. It's an uncharacteristically frantic and fast-paced ride that boils down and livens up the core Elden Ring experience, still scratching the same itch of narrowly overpowering almighty beasts with swords and sorcery. And the best part is you get to do it all with friends for a definitive soulslike co-op experience.\n\nYou may like\n\nElden Ring Nightreign: Everything we know so far\n\nAfter 3 hours, I'm impressed by how Blades of Fire smelts Dark Souls and Monster Hunter together to forge high-impact action into twisted new shapes\n\nEmpyreal review: \"This looter slasher's often beautiful, hand-designed levels and robust challenge kept pulling me back to go one more round\"\n\nHeavy reign\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\n\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\nPublisher: Bandai Namco\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\nRelease date: May 30, 2025\nLet me get this out there early: Elden Ring Nightreign is hard. It's a soulsborne game after all, but it's tough in ways that you probably weren't expecting. Elden Ring, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, and any of its predecessors for that matter let you play at your own pace. You can take your time exploring and power leveling before taking on something big. And if you fail, you can quickly try again or level up some more. To use an overused metaphor, these games are marathons, not sprints.\n\nHowever, Nightreign literally is a sprint and time is a luxury you do not have. Since you're on the clock against the encroaching tide of Night \u2013 a Fortnite-like storm that shrinks the safe area of the Limveld map \u2013 every Expedition must be completed at a breakneck pace. To stand any chance of success, you must act like you've supped from the strongest stuff in the Roundtable Hold's secret coffee stash in a mad dash around the map, hoovering up loot and clobbering what you can before the end of each in-game day. It certainly takes some getting used to, but this comparatively speedy, bitesize roguelike \"run\" format is a surprisingly thrilling and fresh take on the Soulsborne formula. It forces you to improvise and deal with what you're given, which is almost the complete opposite of Elden Ring's relative freedom when it comes to builds.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nMoreover, the fact that you get to do it with friends makes it all the sweeter. Foes of all sizes crumble under barrages of coordinated attacks, and it's immensely satisfying when everyone is on the same page about the best locations to hit, charging together to take on the Night. As a result, the most adaptable, efficient, and daring teams that can weather this uncertain storm are often handsomely rewarded, and it's really exciting when those stars align leaving you feeling unstoppable.\nBut the lightning-fast pace, luck aspects, and jolly co-operation aren't going to be to everyone's taste. Nightreign's Expeditions can be upwards of 45-minutes of brutally relentless, heart-pounding hunting with an incredibly narrow margin for error \u2013 after some particularly testing runs, I genuinely needed to walk around for a few minutes to shake off failure or come down from the victory high. Recklessness and indecision are the true enemies in Elden Ring Nightreign, making it a vicious place for new players. Those who can't keep up won't stand a chance of taking on the game's menagerie of monstrous bosses.\nNight clubbing\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nIt wouldn't be a FromSoftware party without a whole array of brutal bosses and Nightreign obliges with eight terrifying Nightlords waiting for you at the end of their own Expeditions. The first of these, the aforementioned Gladius, is a terrifying intro to what lies ahead in other Expeditions, using sweeping, flaming sword blows, fireball attacks, and the ability to split into three separate wolves to dominate beginner Nightfarers.\nBeyond Gladius, you'll have to face the likes of the Gaping Jaw and Darkdrift Knight. The former is a malformed draconic creature with its mouth on all wrong and the latter is a hulking but wounded centaur, but don't let their looks deceive you. Both are unbelievably strong and frustratingly mobile, capable of killing you in one or two blows that you barely have time to react to \u2013 both make Gladius look like a pushover.\nOutside of the new Nightlords, series devotees will recognize many of the other bosses ready to send them back to the Roundtable Hold broken and bruised from Elden Ring and even the Dark Souls trilogy. It's a genius form of asset re-use that has allowed FromSoftware to make a sandbox that feels like three Avengers fighting He-Man on the first day, a Bionicle on the next, and a Transformer on the third.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nHowever, like these action figures with their worn joints, the older Dark Souls-era bosses haven't aged well, seemingly not receiving the tune-up that I expected. As an example, I was pleasantly surprised to see Dark Souls' Gaping Dragon materialize to cap off Day 2 of a solo run, mainly because I remembered this boss being quite easy to fight, and the same is certainly the case in Nightreign \u2013 it wandered awkwardly around the arena, crashing into the arena perimeter, acting like I wasn't there, but was frustratingly arduous to fight because of its boosted health pool.\nBroadly, all the end-of-day bosses in Nightreign can be a slog to take down due to their robustness. And when they employ attacks that can tear chunks out of your health bar or even one-shot you, they can start to feel unfair. Failing to kill a Nightlord after spending over half an hour fighting for your life to get there can be crushing.\n\n\"Nightreign might be the best game in FromSoftware's repertoire for spectacle.\"\nBut when you do beat them, there is almost no greater feeling. The Nightlords are arguably some of the mightiest bosses ever seen in a FromSoftware game, and getting to revel in victory with other players is unmatched. Whether its coming in clutch to defeat Gladius with both teammates down, overcoming the watery Augur with just one other player, or spending 10-minutes chipping away at the frosty Fissure in the Fog with a flaming sword in an epic clash of fire and ice, Nightreign might be the best game in FromSoftware's repertoire for spectacle.\nNocturnal hunters\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nAs I've hopefully made clear, reaching any of the Nightlords is difficult, and beating any of them is even tougher. While each one has a clearly signposted weakness to a particular damage type \u2013 fire, poison, or holy, for example \u2013 success can also hinge massively on the characters you and your teammates choose and how you outfit them.\nEach of the eight Nightfarer characters feel exceptionally unique, even in the context of Elden Ring's entire sandbox \u2013 FromSoftware has crafted each character with some truly novel abilities that cater to a range of common playstyles, from melee might and defensive approaches to summoners and spell snipers. Duchess and Wylder are without a doubt my favorites \u2013 the former being extremely nimble and optimized for Dexterity weapons, and the latter being an all-rounder swordsman with a fun grappling hook and punchy explosive crossbow.\nWhile adding sets of hero-shooter-like powers to a series renowned for its build flexibility seems highly restrictive, I think it's a necessary sacrifice to accommodate the roguelike format. The game taking key leveling and gear decisions out of your hands means you can get on with facing the Night, otherwise an Expedition would grind to a halt every time you needed to assign attributes.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nBesides, it's not like the game has no answer to build-crafting. Every Nightfarer can equip a few Relics, each granting one to three minor or major upgrades to your character. Defeating Nightlords and completing Remembrances (the personal quests of each Nightfarer) lead you to some of the best Relics too, so you'll only become more powerful the deeper you take Elden Ring Nightreign. It's still quite a limited permanent upgrade system, but it's enough to help you feel like you're min-maxing your characters for certain scenarios.\nAlthough, while Elden Ring Nightreign is an excellent co-op experience where co-ordination is encouraged and rewarded, solo play is an option. The reason I've mentioned it once in passing is because the solo experience is, frankly, miserable. There is apparently some level of solo scaling, but it certainly didn't feel like it from my attempts. Going alone necessitates a more methodical approach that severely limits how much ground can be covered. Some players will relish this challenge, but I found myself often massively underleveled for every boss fight, making true progress almost impossible \u2013 solo players will be far better off sticking to New Game+ in Elden Ring.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nIt's also disappointing that the game's matchmaking system restricts you to playing alone or as part of a trio. Skipping a two-player option feels like a bizarre oversight, and game director Junya Ishizaki has even admitted as much in an interview with IGN, saying duos was \"overlooked and neglected\" but will be considered for post-launch support. The even more disappointing aspect is that there is no crossplay \u2013 something which really should be standard for multiplayer games that are looking to stick around in 2025 and beyond. While I don't doubt that Elden Ring Nightreign will be a success at launch, I can't help but feel like these scaling and multiplayer blunders will impact the game's long-term health, though I hope to be proven wrong with future updates.\nDespite gutting a lot of elements that are core to soulslike games and its questionable longevity, Elden Ring Nightreign is truly for the sickos. The gaps left by what has been cut out have been filled carefully with surprisingly competent roguelike components, making it feel both familiar and refreshingly new. After that initial hump, it proves to be a relentless sprint that can be both exhilarating and excruciating and, depending on your skill and ability to persevere, you may find it swings more so in one direction than the other. Nightreign is Elden Ring at arguably its most brutal but at least you can suffer with friends.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign was reviewed on PS5, with a code provided by the publisher.\nReady to suffer?

An ally and I fell to his blade. As we crawled around, awaiting revival, we watched our last team member pummel the final foe. With micrometers left on his health bar, our minuscule opponent landed a killing blow on our friend and then waltzed away, leaving three corpses in his wake.\n\nWe were tasked with surviving two days before departing to defeat a formidable \"Nightlord.\" We couldn't even make it past the first night.\n\nBut of course, this is Elden Ring. Losing is part of the game.\n\nTogether, bound by a will\n\nElden Ring: Nightreign's announcement at The Game Awards last year perplexed some fans. It first looked like a straightforward sequel \u2014 dropping unexpectedly soon after 2024's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. But then we learned the game was a slimmer, multiplayer experience. Like a purely cooperative Hunt: Showdown \u2014 all about exploration and bosses \u2014 but with the shrinking zones of a Fortnite-style battle royale.\n\nBold as this reinvention might seem, it's not unprecedented. FromSoftware titles \u2014 from Demon's Souls to Bloodborne \u2014 typically feature co-op gameplay alongside infamous player-vs-player \"invasions.\" But Nightreign marks a major pivot into multiplayer design. You can play it solo, but you really shouldn't.\n\nThat's because the game demands tight tactics and timely coordination. Nightreign shrinks Elden Ring's sprawling map and epic storyline into intense \"expeditions\" that last around an hour (at most!). Once you air-drop into the world, you'll scramble to collect healing flasks from ruined churches and powerful upgrades from minibosses. Where you once leisurely explored astride a trusty horse-elk-thing, you'll now scamper on foot, quadruple-jumping up crags and plummeting off cliffs (thankfully, you won't take any damage, no matter how far you fall)!\n\nWith its unrelenting pace, Nightreign makes Elden Ring look like a tea party. I soon learned to ignore all but the most important loot-dropping enemies. I slammed consumable items early and often. I hoarded weapons and frantically swapped between them. I never felt free to explore the contours of what's otherwise a rich and dense world. Nightreign isn't about vibes \u2014 it's a speedrun. You'll have to churn through levels quickly, or a mandatory boss will absolutely send you home early.\n\nAs Night falls, we rise\n\nAs stressful as this new formula might be, Nightreign still effectively synthesizes the arc of a role-playing game, both inside and outside its frenetic expeditions. Its eight playable characters each wield divergent abilities and ultimates. Even failed runs give you resources to buy modular gems that slightly improve a hero's starting stats. And when your team finally defeats one of several possible Nightlords, you'll feel nearly as accomplished as when you triumph over a difficult chapter in an 80-hour RPG.\n\nBut I suspect Nightreign will not have the same broad appeal as the original Elden Ring. While it boasts the trademark sparse dialogue and cryptic lore, it's not the same kind of open-ended adventure you can carve out on your own terms. Along with the upcoming Nintendo-exclusive, The Duskbloods, Nightreign blazes a new era of multiplayer-focused FromSoftware games. That thrills me as someone who's always hungry for great co-op. But I hope the studio I fell in love with never stops making the layered worlds that simply can't be bound by this more limited format.", "summary": "Nightreign shrinks Elden Ring down into intense expeditions that demand tight three-player coordination.

For some, FromSoftware\u2019s open-world action RPG is the pinnacle of hardcore gaming \u2014 an endless gauntlet of death and discovery that rewards heavy stat crunching and min-maxing on specific character builds to bend the game to a player\u2019s will. That level of commitment isn\u2019t for everyone, but it hasn\u2019t prevented Elden Ring and its ilk (including Dark Souls, Sekiro, etc.) from becoming a widely popular subgenre in gaming. Even when the Sisyphean task of beating towering bosses is tough, there\u2019s an entire world of secrets and lore to explore that helps make the difficulty an easier pill to swallow. Along the way, you\u2019ll (hopefully) get better.\n\n But what if all the slow-paced exploration and roleplay were stripped away, leaving behind just the primary loop of playing, dying, and learning again and again? Would it be possible to successfully cherry-pick the most hardcore elements of a game like Elden Ring for a more streamlined approach that caters to top-tier players and casuals alike?\n\n That\u2019s what Elden Ring Nightreign (out May 30) hopes to do, and it works surprisingly well. By setting sights on shorter spurts of action without sacrificing the sense of discovery, Nightreign is designed to be a video game chimera of bizarre influences that mostly work together in stride. For Elden Ring sickos, it requires rethinking of old strategies and perception; for newbies, it demands a major learning curve and more sweat than a game like Fortnite. But once it clicks, Nightreign turns the Soulslike formula into something entirely new.\n\n Bootcamp for all \n\n The first thing to know about Nightreign is that it\u2019s an Elden Ring game through and through. In early previews and pre-release memos, the developers have been adamant that, despite targeting a more casual audience with some more forgiving elements, this is meant to be enjoyed by people who have spent hundreds of hours in the main game and its 2024 expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree.\n\n Whereas those games are fully open-world experiences where players can spend huge swaths of time poking around and learning the ropes at their own pace, Nightreign opts to go full-tilt from the get-go. After selecting a class in the Roundtable Hold (the primary hub to start and return to), players can either queue up with others or go solo for their excursion. The game only allows groups of one or three to play \u2014 no duos can be selected, which is an odd choice.\n\n Dropped into their selected map, players have two in-game days to explore a small, contained region filled with icons, monsters, and mini-bosses, all the while leveling up and finding new gear to empower themselves. At the end of each night, a mandatory boss fight emerges where death means losing the run entirely. If players can survive to the third day, they\u2019ll face a mammoth creature of hellish design (that they\u2019ve selected prior to the mission) that must be defeated to clear the level. None of which is easy.\n\n For the uninitiated, death will come quick. Going solo, enemies have less health than they do in three-player mode, but they\u2019re still extremely lethal. Anyone unfamiliar with the basic combat rhythm of blocking, dodging, and expended precious stamina for an attack will die repeatedly even from basic groups of foes. The game is hard, and you\u2019re expected to take it on the chin and meet it at its level.\n\n Part of that comes down to selecting the right hero to suit your particular play style. From the onset, there are six character types to choose from, each with unique capabilities that neatly fit them into well worn RPG classes: Wylder is a well-rounded swordsman; Ironeye is a ranged archer; Guardian is a slow moving paladin; Raider is a hulking berserker; Recluse serves as a magic-casting sorcerer; and Executor is something like a cross between a monk and druid that\u2019s quick to the cut and can become a feral beast. After progressing through the game, two more classes become available with their own complex systems.\n\n Picking one of these characters doesn\u2019t fully lock users into one path; any of them can pick up all the games\u2019 weaponry and gear, but their individual stats and abilities make them all suited for specific roles. This is key to a successful multiplayer run where synergy is paramount. If one tank-like hero can draw an enemy\u2019s attention, it allows ranged fighters or heavy swordsman to deal damage from the rear. With a solid team, combat can become more strategic and less of a desperate struggle, but it requires getting familiar with each classes\u2019 strengths and weaknesses (and good communication to boot).\n\n Overall, it\u2019s a streamlined take on classic Elden Ring. Rather than spending dozens of hours crafting a unique build for one long solo journey, Nightreign offers the ability to pick up and play with stock archetypes and figure it out on the fly. But it\u2019s the \u201con the fly\u201d part that presents the biggest challenge.\n\n Working against the clock \n\n The greatest change in Nightreign from previous Soulslikes is the speed at which the game operates. Pulling from games like Apex Legends and Fortnite, each map works as a self-contained sandbox with multiple points of interest and structures to explore that grows smaller over time as the poisonous death cloud tightens in a ring.\n\n For anyone accustomed to playing open-world games at their own pace, the first few rounds of Nightreign will be confusing to the point of frustration. Systemically picking off enemies, pilfering treasure chests and selecting the desired loot, and exploring the map and its many secrets is par the course for this type of game, but it comes at the cost of precious time. Each day in Nightreign last maybe ten minutes or more, but there\u2019s no clear on-screen indication of how much time is passing. It\u2019s very easy to get caught up reading the flavor text and stats of an item or even get locked into a large-scale battle with a monster, only for the noxious cloud to arrive abruptly, forcing players to ditch whatever it is they\u2019re doing in a mad dash for safety.\n\n In games like Fortnite the ever-closing ring around the map is more of a slow burn catalyst that pushes players together to force conflict. The same is true here to some degree, although it\u2019s a cooperative PvE (player-vs-environment) game rather than a competitive one. The difference is that Fortnite actively encourages exploration more than Nightreign, despite Elden Ring itself being synonymous with a sense of open-world discovery. After dropping into the map, each run demands that players sprint toward only a handful of locations \u2014 mainly memorized from previous runs \u2014 to get a specific type of elemental loot that will be effective for the bosses later (again, only gleaned from past encounters).\n\n The game isn\u2019t interested in having anyone stop to smell the roses, but the narrow window to get anything done can be exhausting. For players who aren\u2019t already Elden Ring experts, even basic combat can slow things down to the point where only a handful of items or levels can be earned before the invisible clock runs out and it\u2019s time to trudge on with whatever\u2019s in your pockets. Obviously, it\u2019s a game of repetition and attrition; each run is quick enough that defeat doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt morale.\n\n It\u2019s not hard to restart and get ride back in the saddle, but there\u2019s a cheapness to how easily levels and loot can be lost to the mad dash structure of the missions. Dying to an enemy means having to race back to that point from a nearby respawn point, but if the cloud comes, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to regain what you\u2019ve lost. In Elden Ring Nightreign, enemies are punishing, but not as much as the ticking clock.\n\n The tug-of-war between tough combat and the constraints of the time limit make for a double-edged sword. While there\u2019s no real penalty to dipping out of a fight \u2014 other than losing experience and valuable items \u2014 sessions can frequently feel fruitless. If you\u2019ve just cracked the code to felling a flaming stone giant only to be arbitrarily ripped from the encounter to feebly battle a much stronger boss without solid gear, it can be frustrating.\n\n The right stuff \n\n By the same token, the trial-by-fire nature of the game can be conducive to learning at a breakneck pace. As someone who\u2019s not particularly good at (or even that fond of) Elden Ring, I was able to acquire a baseline knowledge of what fights to engage and how best to beat most fodder enemies quickly through trial and error. Mini-bosses and Nightlords (the big bads arriving on day three), were a much bigger hurdle however, especially in solo mode.\n\n Suffice to say, the game really shines in cooperation with other players. Although Elden Ring is renowned for its community of elite gamers who routinely stream their downright ridiculous levels of skill, Nightreign\u2019s systems can be more welcoming to casuals who might not otherwise have the ability (or frankly, the time) to get the most out of the original game. By teaming up with high-tier players, even mediocre gamers can progress relatively far in Nightreign\u2019s mission-based campaign. Whether it\u2019s partnering up with friends or randomly matchmaking with strangers, applying whatever skills you\u2019ve gathered through repetition can be enough to skirt by with the right teammates. Sure, it\u2019s nice to be able to contribute \u2014 it feels a lot better to land a killing blow on a three-headed hellhound than play a chew-toy distraction \u2014 but winning\u2019s winning.\n\n It\u2019s difficult to say if Nightreign will be as endlessly replayable as the original game. By its nature, it\u2019s designed around repetition, but after mastering each mission type and class, the spin-off may not have the same kind of longevity. In Elden Ring, it\u2019s a part-time job getting to the game\u2019s end; it\u2019s a full-time one to master it. There\u2019s still plenty of systems to study and break, but it\u2019s also a game that doles out thrills faster and in more digestible bites than its predecessors, meaning it could be something diehard fans burn through rapidly.\n\n At its heart, Elden Ring Nightreign is two different visions that bleed together surprisingly well. For existing fans, it\u2019s an opportunity to take their skills and become the next great speed runner or boss rush master, dropping in to carry amateurs to the finish line. For casual players, it\u2019s hardcore Fortnite \u2014 a pulse-pounding multiplayer experience that demands your best even though it offers frustratingly little time to teach. Rarely does a game like this manage to cater to such far ends of the gaming spectrum, yet somehow it works.\n\n Elden Ring Nightreign launches on May 30 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X|S, and Windows.", "summary": "FromSoftware's latest blends Soulslike difficulty with Fortnite's ticking-clock framework to make every session an anxiety-filled stress bomb", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-game-review-1235348742/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/elden002.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 14:00:00", "author": "Christopher Cruz", "authors": ["Christopher Cruz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.456}, {"id": 325809162, "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign is equal parts brutal joy-ride and frustrating mess \u2014 yet I can't put it down", "text": "Skip to main content\n\nTom's Guide\n\nTom's Guide \n\nSearch Tom's Guide\n\nView Profile\n\nNewsletters\n\nBest Picks \n\nEntertainment\n\nPlayStation Days of Play\nSwitch 2 Pre-Orders\nBest laptops\nBest Mattress\n\nWordle Today\n\nRecommended reading\n\nSplit Fiction is the best co-op game I\u2019ve played since It Takes Two \u2014 but some of the magic is lost\n\nI enjoyed South of Midnight so much I beat it in 2 sittings \u2014 here's why it's one of 2025's most pleasant surprises\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a beautiful, challenging RPG \u2014 and it\u2019s my game of the year so far\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 isn\u2019t quite the turn-based RPG I expected \u2014 but I can\u2019t put it down\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages is a brutal thrill-ride \u2014 and it's my early pick for game of the year\n\nI\u2019m a fighting game veteran \u2014 and Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is one of the best I've played in years\n\nI\u2019ve played every Assassin\u2019s Creed game since the start \u2014 here\u2019s my verdict on Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows after 60 hours\n\nElden Ring Nightreign is equal parts brutal joy-ride and frustrating mess \u2014 yet I can't put it down \n\nElden Ring Nightreign is a true test for the most die-hard Souls fans\n\n28 May 2025\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

But with developer FromSoftware at the helm and Elden Ring in the name, this action RPG roguelite is already well-primed for game of the year contention.\n\nYet, unlike many of its predecessors, this doesn't feel like an easy shoo-in. With cooperative multiplayer the major focus in Elden Ring Nighteign, pushing to the side rich lore-seeking and deep exploration that prevailed in FromSoftware experiences past, this fresh take on the Souls formula might be a hard pill to swallow for casuals and veterans alike.\nThe underlying challenge remains the same. Whether you're running deep with a group of three or (God willing) solo, Elden Ring Nightreign still keeps the pressure on just like Elden Ring and Dark Souls before it, touting its own list of tough bosses, aptly coined \"Night Lords.\"\n\nYou may like\n\nSplit Fiction is the best co-op game I\u2019ve played since It Takes Two \u2014 but some of the magic is lost\n\nI enjoyed South of Midnight so much I beat it in 2 sittings \u2014 here's why it's one of 2025's most pleasant surprises\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a beautiful, challenging RPG \u2014 and it\u2019s my game of the year so far\n\nAnd, instead of the Lands Between, it's Limveld you'll be surveying this time. The procedurally-generated map is ever-changing and will keep you guessing each time you drop in, but don't dilly-dally \u2014 you only have three in-game days to gear up and gain levels to take on the Night Lord that awaits.\n\nHerein lies the major folly: the time-sink and minuscule rewards gained from each 45-minute run. Remember, base Elden Ring this is not. Whether you\u2019re an age-old Souls fan or a newcomer, Nightreign is a steep learning curve and shows how the Souls identity can't always fit every mold.\nRead on for my full review to see where Elden Ring Nightreign hits all the sweet spots and where it leaves me feeling totally parched.\nElden Ring Nightreign: The basics\n\nWhat is it? Elden Ring Nightreign is a pseudo-Rogue-lite RPG spinoff of Elden Ring. It's developed by FromSoftware and takes place in a procedurally-generated world called Limveld, which is filled to the brim with bosses to conquer. Survival over the course of three days and victory over the reigning Nightlord is key.\nWho is it for? It\u2019s for Dark Souls veterans, Elden Ring fans, three-player co-op enjoyers, roguelite aficionados, and anyone who loves action-based RPGs.\nHow much does it cost? Elden Ring Nightreign costs $39 and will be available on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X on May 30.\nWhat other games has the developer made? While Elden Ring put it on the map, FromSoftware is best known for its Dark Souls franchise and PlayStation exclusives, including Demon's Souls and Bloodborne. It's also the brainchild behind Armored Core, King's Field, and Sekiro.\nWhat games is it similar to? Elden Ring Nightreign is more akin to rogue-lites, namely Hades and Dead Cells, but shares similar qualities to action RPG predecessors, like Elden Ring and Bloodborne.\nThree days in Limveld \n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nWithout any major overarching narrative elements (that you can solve on your own or otherwise), Elden Ring Nightreign plops you into a story of survival. As already mentioned, you have just three days to suit up and attain levels to take on any of its eight Night Lords, and there's not a whole lot of time to do it.\nMost of my 95+ runs tended to last anywhere from 40 to 50 minutes. How it works is you face two tough bosses at the end of each day and, provided you live long enough to make it to the third sunrise, you come face to face with an even more menacing foe that puts all others to shame.\nEvery run feels relatively different enough, up until around the 70-hour mark. The world of Limveld is supposedly \"ever-changing,\" but it remains largely the same in some critical ways.\nSometimes you'll see newer night closing bosses \u2014 for instance, I only saw the Nameless King (a returning boss from Dark Souls 3) once \u2014 or you'll get varied upgrades along the way that change how you play.\nIt's in the Shifting Earth scenarios and random boss raids where things get interesting. These tend to follow the defeat of major Night Lords, or will spawn in randomly later into your time with Nightreign. Shifting Earths completely change the map, netting you particular rewards based on the environment.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\nOn the other hand, those aforementioned Raids can often change the run entirely. You might be in the middle of fighting a boss or trudging through the map to get a valuable item, like an extra flask that might prove vital against a Night Lord, when, out of nowhere, Margit the Fell Omen comes in to shake things up.\nOn paper, this might sound like something that scratches the itch for wary challenge-seekers. In practice, though, it often gets annoying \u2014 even despite the fact that Margit is relatively easy to beat. It's just an added encumbrance on top of an overly large map and the stress of a ticking clock nipping at your nerves.\nAlthough there might be some alternative methods for getting around the map more easily, they don't always help in the end. I found myself using jump pads (known as Spiritstreams) the most versus the Spectral Hawks. The latter were often far too much out of the way and didn't always offer me the fastest route to my objective, which made navigation largely feel tedious at times.\nChoosing the right Nightfarer\n\n(Image credit: Future)\nMuch akin to the start of many a FromSoftware experience, Nightreign similarly offers players a list of characters to choose from. Except, this time your experience is largely fueled by that character's individual playstyle \u2014 meaning you don't have much of a say in that character's particular skillset.\nTherefore, you're locked into one mode of play depending on the character you choose. Luckily, there's a lot to enjoy in this department. The range of eight Nightfarers includes Wylder, Executor, Iron Eyes, Revenant, Recluse, Guardian, Raider, and Duchess. Each has a Passive Ability, Character Skill, and Ultimate Art that match their playstyles.\nI mostly played with Wylder and Executor, but also tried a bit of Revenant, Iron Eyes, and Recluse. Executor was one of my favorites, serving as the Nightreign-branded dex build and Sekiro insert of the bunch. He wields a trusty katana and an ultimate that allows him to turn into a monstrous beast that can do devastating damage to bosses.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\nWith Executor, I usually ran dual katanas for that incredible bleed buildup and with Wylder, I tended to use dual greatswords. I kind of enjoy power stancing in this game (as much as I did in Elden Ring and Dark Souls 2), and it's nice that you can even use weapons you don't want to wield to your advantage.\nFor instance, a weapon might not be the best for a particular build, but it could have better jump attacks as a passive ability. Even just keeping this in one of your slots will be highly beneficial, and it incentivizes you to constantly pick up new gear even if the item in question doesn't match your playstyle.\nUltimate Arts can prove the end-all be-all of an entire run. You'll have to wisely choose to either save an Ultimate for picking up fallen teammates or using it against bosses, just to get a good stagger in so your friends can wail on them. It's a tough balance and cooldowns often vary, but largely depend on the amount of landed attacks you make on a foe or even a fallen comrade.\nNightfarers also have some interesting story beats to dive into. Coined \"Remembrances,\" these side missions expound on their motives and can bring you to some interesting places, granting you new skins and even some useful Relics. These can be used to upgrade characters for every run.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nRelics are a handy way to incentivize runs. Whether you die or defeat a Night Lord, you're granted a list of rewarded Relics, which can grant you a variety of different things like boosted stamina or intelligence, heightened attack power when applying poison to foes, or granting fire to a weapon when using a Character Skill.\nAlthough these can be incredibly important in your first few hours, after a while, repeat Relics become common, and even some new ones become entirely useless. Eventually, you'll find the ones that match your mode of play and simply roll with them \u2014 and that's kind of the end of them.\n\nA second opinion on Elden Ring: Nightreign\n\nA second opinion on Elden Ring: Nightreign\nRory Mellon Senior Entertainment Editor (UK)\n\nElden Ring: Nightreign is a tough game to judge. It\u2019s provided me with some of my favorite co-op gaming memories in literally decades, like the time Ryan, an industry peer, and I defeated one of the game\u2019s toughest foes with barely a sliver of health remaining after three unsuccessful attempts. But the repetitive nature of each run can lead to lengthy stretches where you feel you\u2019re going through the motions and making precious little progress. It\u2019s an experience of highs and lows, but when the final Nightlord finally fell to my volley of arrows (and the cold steel of my co-op companions), I did find myself itching for just one more run. But heed my words, don\u2019t venture into the night solo; you\u2019ll need strong partners to defeat this challenge\nA newness sorely lacking \n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nThere's a lot to love here. As someone who has played all of FromSoftware's catalog, I was thoroughly excited to give this fresh spin a try and it's been a lot of fun, for the most part.\nDespite the underlying enjoyment, there are a bevy of hindrances and the most glaring of them all is the fact that you really need a solid group of three to persist in this game. There's just no way anyone's going to run through Nightreign with just random players casually. If so, you'd have to get real lucky.\nCommunication is key in this game. While you can get by with simple markers and pings on the map, sitting in a voice chat makes this a total breeze. Otherwise, you can't accurately time when to use an Ultimate or specify where someone's going at a particular moment.\nA major point of contention for me was picking up teammates. When another hero loses all of their health, they'll fall to the ground in a glowing purple hue and you'll have to hit them several times before they're rejuvenated. Although it might sound simple enough, it proves a little tedious given the lackluster in-game targeting and the minimal amount of stamina you have in this game.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nThe stamina gauge in Nightreign is a huge misstep in my opinion. It's one of the biggest problems I had in most of my runs, always running out of stamina in the worst situations \u2014 largely because bosses jump around the map so much you have to run around to catch up with them, only for your stamina bar to deplete in seconds.\nIt would make more sense if you didn't have to expend stamina on dashes to get to bosses or use much less stamina in boss scenarios, making Night Lord fights and even night cap bosses feel a lot less time-consuming. I feel like a good portion of the time is spent waiting for my stamina gauge to replenish and with a couple of tweaks, I feel like this could easily be amended.\nAnd one of my biggest gripes is not being allowed to buy more items at the final night market or even sell items to get some extra runes back. It prevents you from shifting all the useless gear you've accumulated over the run.\nWhat this game needs the most, though, is duos. I truly don't understand why a solo mode was prioritized over duos \u2014 I guess for offline players, mostly, but I see a large side of the player base running with randoms or friends, for the most part. Duos could add such an awesome dynamic to this game, and I hope FromSoftware does end up adding this mode in a future update.\nElden Ring Nightreign: Verdict\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nI could yap all day long about this game. Elden Ring Nightreign is totally different from anything FromSoftware has done before. It fits into a whole new mold, one that gives Souls veterans a seemingly never-ending challenge that will test their skills for years to come.\nBut after over 70 hours of gameplay, I feel I've seen pretty much everything Nightreign has to offer, and there's little else drawing me back in. Aside from playing with other Nightfarers and running their Remembrances, there's not much else here in terms of replayability and the relics I could garner won't amount to much against what I've already got.\nI'll be around helping new players take down bosses, of course, but once I've seen them through the Night Lords, I don't see much else keeping me (and others) sticking around until future DLC. And that's a real shame coming from the spinoff of an experience that heralded hundreds of hours of enjoyment.\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nStaff Writer\n\nRyan Epps is a Staff Writer under the TV/AV section at Tom's Guide focusing on TVs and projectors.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Rami Tabari)\n\nAre you ready, Nightfarers? I battle-bused my way down to Limveld in Elden Ring Nightreign and got a proper hazing from the Night Lords, all so I can tell you how this monster performs.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign is the latest entry into FromSoftware\u2019s medley of masochist nightmares, a co-op roguelike spin-off of its renowned namesake. It\u2019s not just an asset-reskin, either \u2014 the combat got a much-needed rework to allow for smoother mobility and even unique movesets. Now, it has its problems mechanically\u2026 and performance-wise.\nI played Elden Ring Nightreign on the HP Omen Max 16 (RTX 5090), the Lenovo ThinkPad X9-15 Gen 1 Aura Edition (Intel Arc 140V), and the Asus ROG Flow Z13 (AMD Radeon 8060S). My plan was to initially play it only on an RTX 5090 and see how it ran, but you\u2019ll see why that plan went out of the window in a moment.\n\nYou may like\n\n'Doom: The Dark Ages' is my favorite kind of nightmare \u2014 this is how it runs on an RTX 5090 gaming laptop\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion: Remastered is here, and this is how it runs on my RTX 5090 gaming laptop\n\nRTX 5090 Laptop GPU performance: The frame-gen future has arrived\n\nHere\u2019s what happened.\n\nHow I (night)fared in Elden Ring Nightreign\n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware)\nAfter I finished fangirling over the menu music, I jumped right into Nightreign on Maximum settings at 2560 x 1600 with the HP Omen Max 16, which features the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU \u2014 the best GPU commercially available.\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are no customizable DLSS 4 settings within Elden Ring Nightreign, so I couldn\u2019t enable DLAA or anything like that, which would boost visuals and performance. Technically, I could use DLSS 4 Override to change some settings via the Nvidia app, like turning on Multi-Frame Generation, but unfortunately, that was irrelevant.\nWhy? Well, like Elden Ring and nearly every other FromSoftware game, Nightreign is capped at a sad 60 frames per second. As you might imagine, the most powerful gaming laptop around was more than capable of hitting that cap. So, fps performance data is effectively useless.\nI did want to measure the latency, which is super important for multiplayer games, but Nvidia\u2019s performance-measuring software FrameView doesn\u2019t pick up Nightreign\u2019s latency numbers. That\u2019s likely because FromSoftware didn\u2019t include latency markers to measure that exact data.\nHowever, despite crushing that 60-fps cap, I experienced some performance hiccups while playing Nightreign.\n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware)\nOne issue I had was Nightreign not saving my setting to Borderless Windowed mode, instead switching back to Fullscreen. This became an issue when I alt-tabbed at the beginning of an expedition, and the whole game slowed down to a crawl. I wasn\u2019t the only one who experienced it either \u2014 my whole team got the same lag spike. You might think it\u2019s a coincidence, but when I switched my setting back to Borderless, the lag stopped and the game loaded normally. I did host the session, so it may have had something to do with that.\nAnother huge issue I clocked was some choppy network performance. I raced to speak with God in the churches across Limveld, and it felt smooth as butter. But when we got to the creatively named Gaping Jaw boss of the second expedition, all of our games experienced massive frame drops when it started to yeet some lightning at us. This seemed more like a network issue than a hardware issue since the experience was shared. Yet it happened only when there were a ton of effects on the screen. This is something that must be addressed in an update, either at or post-launch. Needless to say, we died.\nOtherwise, playing Elden Ring Nightreign on a $4K+ gaming laptop felt like a dream. But what about a regular old laptop? Yep, I ran Nightreign on the Lenovo ThinkPad X9-15 Gen 1 Aura Edition\u2019s Intel Arc 140V iGPU, and it was rough, but not for the reason I expected. I thought the game would crash on startup, but it booted up, and I managed to get to the Roundtable Hold without the game breaking.\nAt Low, 1200p settings, I managed a decent 30 to 40 fps. That\u2019s way better than what I expected. And when jumping into an expedition, it dropped to 20 to 40 fps. That\u2019s still perfectly fine. But it still managed to be completely unplayable. Why? Frame drops. Every eight to twelve seconds, the fps would tank to 2 to 4 fps for one to three seconds. I did manage to kill an Abductor Virgin (terrible name by the way), but I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone play the game like this. I even turned the graphics all the way down to 800 x 600 to see if that would help, and it boosted the fps a little bit, but the frame drops remained consistent.\n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware)\nThe Omen and ThinkPad showcased the best and worst kind of performance you can experience, respectively. But not all integrated graphics are created equal, which is why I also tackled Nightreign with the Asus ROG Flow Z13\u2019s AMD Radeon 8060S iGPU.\nRunning performance tests on the Flow Z13 provided a little more variety, but overall, consistently strong numbers. On Maximum settings at 2560 x 1600, the Flow Z13 captured a strong 50 frames per second. I\u2019ve gushed about the Flow Z13\u2019s integrated graphics before, but it\u2019s still damn impressive. Bumping the graphics down yielded 55 fps on High, 57 fps on Medium, and 58 fps on Low. You get some diminishing returns once you start lowering the graphics. Overall, I\u2019d recommend maxing it out and experiencing all that Nightreign has to offer.\nI called it out when Elden Ring Nightreign\u2019s PC requirements were announced, but this game can run completely fine on low-end and older hardware. But for the most part, I\u2019d stay away from integrated graphics, unless you got those slick new AMD iGPUs.\n\nToday's best Gaming Laptops deals\n\n127 Amazon customer reviews\n\n \u00a3449.25View Deal\n\n \u00a3649View Deal\n\n \u00a3799.99View Deal\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nGet The Snapshot, our free newsletter on the future of computing\nSign up to receive The Snapshot, a free special dispatch from Laptop Mag, in your inbox.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRami Tabari\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nReviews Editor\n\nRami Tabari is the Reviews Editor for Laptop Mag.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\n\nThe Elden Ring: Nightreign metacritic score is in, and while it's the lowest-reviewed FromSoftware score in years, that's still a very high bar to clear.\n\nThe Elden Ring: Nightreign Metacritic score currently sits at 78. That matches up exactly with its PS5 score, although the PC score sits a little higher at 81 - more PS5 reviews mean the average will skew slightly lower. Clearly, that's a pretty solid score, but it's not one that matches up particularly closely with FromSoftware's recent efforts.\nElden Ring itself, for instance, boasts a 96. Shadow of the Erdtree sits a little lower, while Armored Core 6 is in the low-to-mid 80s, depending on platform. Sekiro sits around the high-80s/low-90s bracket, and every major Soulsborne game has a score of at least 85. By contrast, the Elden Ring: Nightreign Metacritic score of 78 might be a little disappointing, but it's worth remembering that it's still a pretty solid launch amid an almost generational run of amazing titles. A re-release and a VR exclusive aside, you've got to go back to 2013's Armored Core: Verdict Day to find a major FromSoft release that scored less than 80 on Metacritic.\n\nYou may like\n\nElden Ring Nightreign review: \"An uncharacteristically frantic and fast-paced ride that boils down the core Elden Ring experience\"\n\nFromSoftware had to adjust the difficulty in Elden Ring Nightreign after the beta to make sure it's \"challenging as you progress, but still manageable,\" and yes, some things are harder now\n\nThe Assassin's Creed Shadows metacritic score is here, and it's level with Valhalla\n\nElden Ring: Nightreign's Metacritic score has been matched by two other FromSoftware games. Not only the studio of dark fantasy and massive mechs, in 2000, it put out The Adventures of Cookie & Cream, a couch co-op spin on Crash Bandicoot-style platforming. In the same year, it netted the same score for Armored Core 2, which I'd argue has a more impressive legacy, but either way, Nightreign's in some interesting company.\n\nIn our own Elden Ring: Nightreign review, Will said that it was an \"uncharacteristically frantic\" take on the Elden Ring experience, and that the Soulslike elements that have been cut have been replaced by \"surprisingly competent roguelike components.\" The suggestion that \"Nightreign is Elden Ring at arguably its most brutal\" is a little worrying, but I'm certainly still keen to dive in.\nThe Nightreign team has been hard at work on balance all week - so much so that it's already nerfed bleed builds.\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nSee more Xbox Series X News\n\nFromSoftware\n\nXbox Series X\n\nPlayStation\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nManaging Editor, News\n\nI'm GamesRadar's Managing Editor for news, shaping the news strategy across the team.

In general, though, success in Nightreign is a matter of keeping at it until you stumble on the right mix of luck and execution to finally best the Nightlords.\n\nFind a friend\n\nWhile Nightreign technically has a single-player mode, the game is quite explicitly designed for groups of three simultaneous humans (groups of two need not apply\u2014paired players will need to join up with a third). Being in a threesome generally means that one player can draw an enemy's attack while the other two take advantage by flanking around their guard. It also means that downed players can be revived by a partner repeatedly hitting their crawling near-corpse with a weapon, an awkward and hilarious process in practice.\n\nBeing able to coordinate with your teammates is crucial both during battles and as you decide which location to explore next in the ever-narrowing circle of the available map. If you're not playing with friends and chatting over a voice connection, your main form of communication is an awkward system of pinning points of interest on the map.\n\nUnfortunately, I ran into some serious problems with lag in my pre-release multiplayer runs, with the game periodically freezing for multiple seconds at a time as the servers struggled to keep up. I often came out of these freezes to find I had succumbed to an enemy attack that I hadn't even seen on my screen. I can't say this server performance in a tightly controlled pre-launch environment bodes well for how the game will perform once the wider public gains access in a few days.\n\nThose technical problems aside, I was surprised at how well this zippy, capsule-size take on the Elden Ring formula worked in practice. Nightreign might not be the full-fledged, epic Elden Ring sequel that long-time \"Soulsborne\" fans are looking for, but it's still a compelling, action-packed twist on the popular adventure gameplay.", "summary": "Fast-paced multiplayer action fits surprisingly well with the old Elden Ring formula.", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/elden-ring-nightreign-is-an-epic-rpg-squeezed-into-delicious-bite-size-capsules/", "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightreign5-1152x648.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 14:00:22", "author": "Kyle Orland", "authors": ["Kyle Orland"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.174}, {"id": 325884224, "title": "Elden Ring: Nightreign (PS5) Review - CGMagazine", "text": "Elden Ring: Nightreign is both a love letter and a remix of everything FromSoftware fans adore.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware)\n\nElden Ring Nightreign is basically an experiment for FromSoftware, which has tried its hand at a \"condensed RPG\" with a \"sporty\" feel, per director Junya Ishizaki.\n\nOne of its more surprising elements is the to-hell-with-canon inclusion of bosses and, via cosmetics, characters from previous FromSoftware games, especially the Dark Souls trilogy. Ishizaki previously said this just sounded like a fun idea, and in an interview with GamesRadar+, he reckons it also legitimately worked with the themes of Elden Ring itself.\n\"Honestly, they seemed like they'd be a good fit for this project,\" he says. \"It seemed like as good a time as any. The world of Elden Ring, as a base, is somewhat embedded in chaos and having people being drawn to The Lands Between, and as Nightreign was an offshoot of that world, we wanted to really embrace this aspect, this feeling of characters being summoned from all corners of of this more expansive world, and being brought in from these different areas and these different times and places.\n\nYou may like\n\nAfter Elden Ring's hugeness, Nightreign director says the spinoff let FromSoftware try something \"sporty\" with \"almost a bit of a rough and loosened and fast tempo feel\"\n\nElden Ring Nightreign review: \"An uncharacteristically frantic and fast-paced ride that boils down the core Elden Ring experience\"\n\nThe director of Elden Ring Nightreign has been thinking about this game since Dark Souls 3, and \"seeing the scope of Elden Ring\" finally made it click in his mind\n\n\"So this is something where we felt, well, why don't we extend that a little bit to the Dark Souls series as well? We thought that that would be a fun fit.\"\n\nI mentioned that Nightreign has a bit of a Super Smash Bros. feel to it, with many fans jokingly but fairly pointing out the 'everyone is here' vibe of some trailers.\nIshizaki didn't jump on the Smash comparison directly, but in a weird way, it sounds like he and FromSoftware were thinking along similar lines at some point in production, just with fewer memes. It doesn't make a lick of sense canonically, but it does kind of make sense thematically. The gloves are off; everyone, get in here.\nOur Elden Ring Nightreign review calls it \"a surprisingly well-executed roguelike that melds well with the core of Elden Ring and even builds on it,\" but be warned: playing the game solo can be downright miserable.\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nElden Ring Nightreign Metacritic score sets it as the lowest-scored FromSoftware game in 7 years and ties a 25-year-old PS2 platformer nobody remembers, but that's before the multiplayer buff sets in.\n\nSee more PS5 News\n\nXbox Series X\n\nPlayStation\n\nAustin Wood\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nSenior writer\n\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

News. \"Truly. I just found out a little bit ago and I still just can't believe it.\"\n\n His biological mother is Todd\u2019s ex-wife, Teresa Terry.\n\n \"I know Savannah had been working at this for so long and she never gave up,\" he continued. \"So I'm just grateful to her and to President Trump for making this happen for my dad and Julie.\"\n\n Todd, 56, and Julie, 52, were indicted in August 2019 and later sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison after being convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The couple had been appealing their case ever since.\n\n Kyle, who only appeared on the first season of Chrisley Knows Best as he became estranged from his father, told E! News he is hopeful for the future.\n\n \"I know they can't wait to get home and just be with family, and I'm going to remain hopeful that another reconciliation is possible,\" Kyle told the outlet.\n\n During a July 2024 episode of her Unlocked podcast, Savannah explained why their father chose not to speak with Kyle.\n\n \u201cMy dad has every reason not to speak to Kyle,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because it\u2019s your child doesn\u2019t mean that you have to accept abuse. It doesn't mean you have to accept manipulation and hate and all these things.\u201d\n\n After saying she and her father had the \u201cstrongest relationship,\u201d she spoke out against her sibling.\n\n \u201cPeople will do anything for a little bit of fame or attention,\u201d Savannah claimed, saying Kyle provides statements about their father on social media and to the press. \u201cWhat I don't process well is having Kyle play the victim to life circumstances he's created. What I don't do well with someone who has abused people his entire life now trying to play victim, trying to get people to feel bad for him.\u201d\n\n She continued, \u201cYes, my father has not spoken to him and that is because now, we are all at a place where we don't have to be abused any further. We are allowed to create boundaries for ourselves.\u201d\n\n On Tuesday, Savannah said Trump called her personally to let her know he would be pardoning her parents. \n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n During the call, she said he told her Todd and Julie were \"given a pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\"\n\n The couple\u2019s youngest son, 19-year-old Grayson Chrisley, also reacted to the news. \n\n \"PRAISE GOD!!!!

They were also found guilty of tax evasion, obscuring their earnings while showcasing a luxurious way of living that authorities said included high-priced cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.\n\nProsecutors said the couple walked away from their responsibility for repayment when Todd Chrisley declared bankruptcy and left $20-plus million in unpaid loans. Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years in federal prison, and Todd Chrisley got 12 years behind bars. The couple was also ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution.\n\n\u201cYour parents are going to be free and clean and I hope that we can do it by tomorrow,\u201d Trump said in a call with their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, according to a video posted online by a White House aide. In a social media post, the aide declared, \u201cTrump Knows Best!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I\u2019m hearing,\u201d the president added a few moments later of the couple.\n\nA White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss decisions that hadn\u2019t yet been made public, said the pardons would be forthcoming.\n\nThe move continues a pattern of Trump pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers. On Monday, Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on fraud and bribery charges. The president posted online that Jenkins and his family \u201chave been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\u201d\n\nThe president has also moved to pardon Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive imprisoned on tax charges, whose mother helped expose the contents of a diary kept by Ashley Biden, daughter of former President Joe Biden. And, in April, he pardoned Nevada Republican Michele Fiore, who was awaiting sentencing on federal charges that she used money meant for a statue honoring a slain police officer for personal costs, including plastic surgery.\n\nThe Chrisleys\u2019 attorney, Alex Little, said the pardon \u201ccorrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump recognized what we\u2019ve argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias,\u201d Little said in a statement.\n\nLittle\u2019s statement added, \u201cTodd and Julie\u2019s case is exactly why the pardon power exists. Thanks to President Trump, the Chrisley family can now begin healing and rebuilding their lives.\u201d\n\nBefore the Chrisleys became reality television stars, they, and a former business partner, submitted false documents to banks in the Atlanta area to obtain fraudulent loans, prosecutors said during their trial. They accused the couple of spending lavishly, then using new fraudulent loans to pay off old ones.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last summer upheld the Chrisleys\u2019 convictions but found a legal error in how the trial judge had calculated Julie Chrisley\u2019s sentence by holding her accountable for the entire bank fraud scheme. The appellate panel sent her case back to the lower court for resentencing.\n\nSavannah Chrisley spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where she talked about her parents\u2019 imprisonment. She said then that they were \u201cpersecuted by rogue prosecutors\u201d \u2014 echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric about the criminal justice system as he faced investigations and criminal cases of his own.\n\nShe said Trump had been targeted for his politics, and said her parents likewise were targeted because of their conservative beliefs and high profile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget what the prosecutors said in the most heavily Democratic county in the state, before an Obama-appointed judge. He called us the \u2018Trumps of the South,\u2019\u201d Savannah Chrisley said in her remarks at the convention, adding, \u201cHe meant it as an insult but, let me tell you, boy, do I wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d", "summary": "WASHINGTON -- President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0announced Tuesday that he\u2019s planning to pardon\u00a0TV stars\u00a0Todd and Julie Chrisley, famous for \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d a reality show that followed their tight-knit family and extravagant lifestyle that prosecutors said was boosted by bank fraud and hiding earnings from tax authorities.\n\n\nThe post Watch: Trump Calls Tearful Reality Star Savannah Chrisley to Break News About Her Parents Todd and Julie Chrisley\u2019s Pardons appeared first on Breitbart.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/05/28/trump-plans-pardons-for-reality-stars-todd-and-julie-chrisley-after-fraud-tax-evasion-convictions/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/05/Todd-and-Julie-Chrisley-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 11:46:24", "author": "Breitbart News", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.018}, {"id": 325807754, "title": "Trump is pardoning Todd and Julie Chrisley, the reality TV couple convicted of fraud", "text": "President Trump says he will fully pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, reality TV personalities who have served more than two years in prison after being convicted of funding their lavish lifestyle through tax evasion and bank fraud.\n\nThe couple rose to fame starring in the USA Network show Chrisley Knows Best, which ran from 2014 to 2023. It focused on the wealth and interpersonal dynamics of their seven-person family, living in the Atlanta and then Nashville, Tenn., areas.\n\nThough the Chrisleys portrayed themselves as successful real estate tycoons and self-made multimillionaires, they were eventually accused of funding their lifestyle through dishonest means.\n\nProsecutors said they conspired to defraud community banks in the Atlanta area to take out more than $36 million in personal loans. They spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones. They said the Chrisleys failed to pay taxes for the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years. \n\nTodd and Julie were sentenced to 12 and 7 years in federal prison, respectively, after a jury convicted them of bank and tax fraud offenses in 2022.\n\n\"Over the course of a decade, the defendants defrauded banks out of tens of millions of dollars while evading payment of their federal income taxes,\" then-U.S. Attorney Ryan Buchanan said at the time, adding that their \"lengthy sentences reflect the magnitude of their criminal scheme.\"\n\nThe Chrisleys have denied the charges and claimed they were unfairly targeted because of their conservative beliefs. Their oldest daughter, Savannah, has become an outspoken critic of the criminal justice system since her parents' incarceration.\n\nShe spoke onstage at the Republican National Convention in July, calling her parents victims of political persecution. After Trump took office, she told People that she was \"going through the proper channels\" to try to get them pardoned, and had lunch at the White House in February.\n\nThose efforts seem to have paid off. On Tuesday, White House special assistant Margo Martin tweeted a video of Trump calling Savannah from the Oval Office to inform her of her parents' pardons.\n\n\"It's a terrible thing, but it's a great thing because your parents are going to be free and clean and I hope we can do it by tomorrow,\" Trump asked, as his pardon czar, Alice Marie Johnson, looked on. \"I don't know them but give them my regards and wish them a good life.\"\n\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields told NPR in an email on Wednesday that the Chrisleys' sentences were \"far too harsh.\"\n\n\"The President is always pleased to give well-deserving Americans a second chance, especially those who have been unfairly targeted and overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system,\" Fields added.\n\nThe law firm representing the Chrisleys, Litson PLLC, said in a statement that their prosecution was \"tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias,\" and praised the couple for their \"exemplary\" conduct in prison, noting that Julie obtained dozens of educational certificates and Todd advocated for better prison conditions.\n\n\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" said attorney Alex Little. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile.\"\n\nSavannah, 27, profusely thanked Trump both on the call and in a series of videos on her social media accounts, in which she said her parents would be coming home shortly.\n\n\"I am eternally grateful,\" she said in one. \"I'm freaking out, I'm still sweating. We're getting some clothes together for Mom and Dad, we're getting their room put together upstairs, and I'm just speechless. \u2026 My parents get to start their lives over.\"\n\nWhat's happened since the Chrisleys' incarceration \n\nA federal grand jury indicted Todd and Julie, now 56 and 52, on 12 counts of bank and wire fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy in 2019. Their accountant, Peter Tarantino, was also found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States and willfully filing false tax returns.\n\nThe Chrisleys began serving their sentences, in two separate Florida prisons, in January 2023, and have been appealing them ever since. (Julie was later reassigned to a prison in Kentucky.)\n\nTheir sentences were reduced for good behavior in September 2023, Todd's by two years and Julie's by 14 months. An appeals court upheld their convictions in 2024, but, citing a calculation error, sent Julie's case back to a lower court \u2014 which ultimately upheld her original sentence.\n\nSavannah, who hosts a podcast called \"Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley,\" has been outspoken about the hardships associated with her parents' incarceration, from having to take on guardianship of her younger brother and niece to the harsh conditions in prison.\n\n\"The heat index was 105-110 degrees, and there's no air conditioning outside the visitation room,\" she said in 2024 about the Kentucky facility where Julie was living. \"Mom said she got physically sick from the heat. It's beyond inhumane.\"\n\nChrisley Knows Best and a spinoff, Growing Up Chrisley, were both canceled in the wake of the couples' convictions. But just days before their pardon, Lifetime announced it will put the famous family back on screen later this year, in a docuseries currently being called The Untitled Chrisleys Project. The network said the show will follow the family members as they navigate life with their parents in prison.\n\n\"In the new series, the Chrisleys don't know best anymore, but they're doing their best to be there for each other,\" the press release reads. \"The family faces the challenge of carrying on the Chrisley name and legacy on their own with only phone calls and brief visits with their incarcerated parents.\"\n\nTrump continues his streak of high-profile pardons\n\nTrump has pardoned a number of high-profile supporters in the early months of his second term, starting with hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nIn February, he pardoned disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of corruption-related crimes in 2011. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year sentence during his first term. Blagojevich attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in support of Trump, whom he called \"the most demonized political figure in American history \u2014 and I know something about being demonized.\"\n\nIn March, Trump pardoned former Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey, who was two weeks into a 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme (which he pleaded guilty to in 2022 but later tried unsuccessfully to rescind).\n\n\"May God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\" Kelsey said after receiving the full pardon.\n\nIn April, Trump pardoned Michele Fiore, a former Las Vegas city councilwoman and former Republican state lawmaker who was awaiting sentencing on federal wire fraud charges. Fiore, a loyal Trump supporter, was accused of using money meant to honor a slain police officer for her personal expenses, including cosmetic surgery, rent and her daughter's wedding.\n\nAnd just this week, on Monday, Trump announced a pardon for Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was found guilty of accepting over $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointing multiple businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs in his Culpeper County department. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison in March, and was reportedly due to report to prison on Tuesday.", "summary": "Todd and Julie Chrisley, who rose to fame in a reality show highlighting their lavish lifestyle, had been serving yearslong prison sentences after 2022 convictions on bank and tax fraud offenses.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414091/todd-julie-chrisley-pardon-trump", "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2741x1827+0+0/resize/2741x1827!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2Fd7%2F737c9e63445c950e67ba69f26c66%2Fap24173852159276.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 14:50:12", "author": "Rachel Treisman", "authors": ["Rachel Treisman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.346}, {"id": 325813182, "title": "Joe Exotic Calls Out Trump Pardon of Todd and Julie Chrisley While He Remains Behind Bars: \u2018Being Innocent Is Not Enough\u2019", "text": "Joseph \u201cJoe Exotic\u201d Maldonado-Passage is calling out the White House after President Donald Trump issued a pardon for Todd and Julie Chrisley without giving him one as well.\n\n The former Tiger King star, 62, who was convicted in 2019 of plotting a murder-for-hire against animal rights activist Carole Baskin, took to X to share his frustrations with the American legal system.\n\n \u201cI guess being innocent is not enough in America,\u201d he wrote, adding, \"I'm left to die of [prostate] cancer before I can get any help.\u201d\n\n \u201cWhy is it the entire world can see the evidence but the White House refuses to acknowledge,\u201d he added.\n\n Exotic was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his crimes, which included hiring two people \u2014 one of whom was an undercover FBI agent \u2014 to kill Baskin and killing five tigers to make room for other large zoo cats.

They have been appealing their case ever since their sentencing.\n\n Initially, Julie's appeal was granted due to insufficient evidence, while Todd's was upheld.

The show followed the wealthy, Southern-based family, including husband-and-wife Todd and Julie and their five children \u2014 Lindsie, Kyle, Chase, Savannah and Grayson \u2014 as they navigated their everyday lives.\n\n Chrisley Knows Best quickly became a fan favorite, running for 10 seasons and spawning spinoffs, including Growing Up Chrisley. But the road to fame and fortune for Chrisleys wasn\u2019t without its bumps: The family experienced multiple trials and tribulations over the years, including a $45 million bankruptcy filing and their estrangement at times from Kyle and Lindsie.\n\n Their biggest hurdle came in 2019, however, when Todd and Julie were indicted on federal charges of tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy. Todd and Julie were found guilty on all counts in June 2022 and were sentenced to a combined 19 years in federal prison.\n\n The legal drama was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d for the entire Chrisley family. The ordeal was especially challenging for Todd and Julie\u2019s eldest daughter, Savannah, who took on the responsibility of raising her younger brother, Grayson, and her niece Chloe (whom the Chrisleys adopted in 2016) while her parents were in prison.\n\n From their reality TV beginnings to their time behind bars, here\u2019s a look at what happened to Todd and Julie Chrisley and where they are now.\n\n Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley? \n\n Born in Georgia and raised in South Carolina, Michael Todd Chrisley \u2014 who goes by his middle name, Todd \u2014 is a self-made real estate entrepreneur from humble beginnings. Growing up, his mother, Faye Chrisley, \u201cworked 60 hours a week in a textile mill to make sure we had everything we wanted and needed,\u201d he wrote in a 2020 Instagram post.\n\n Todd married his high school girlfriend, Teresa Terry, and they welcomed two children together: Lindsie in 1989 and Kyle in 1991. Following their divorce, Todd wed a second time to fellow South Carolina native Julie Chrisley (n\u00e9e Hughes) in 1996, who worked at a local bank.\n\n \u201cShe\u2019s the only woman who has ever literally touched my soul,\u201d Todd said about Julie on a March 2022 episode of their podcast, Chrisley Confessions.\n\n The couple welcomed their first child together, Chase, a week after their nuptials. They went on to have two more children \u2014 Savannah in 1997 and Grayson in 2006 \u2014 and raised their growing family in the wealthy Atlanta suburb of Roswell.\n\n Over the years, the duo also weathered challenges, such as Julie\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis in 2012 and their ongoing estrangement from Todd\u2019s oldest son, Kyle.\n\n Todd and Julie rose to fame as the stars of their eponymous reality show, Chrisley Knows Best, which aired on the USA Network from 2014 to 2023.\n\n Billed as the southern version of the Kardashians, the series followed the over-the-top family as they lived their lavish lifestyle \u2014 first, in a 30,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta; then, in two equally opulent Nashville homes \u2014 for 10 seasons.\n\n The popularity of the show resulted in a spinoff series, Growing Up Chrisley, that followed the lives of Chase and Savannah from 2019 to 2022.\n\n What crimes were Todd and Julie Chrisley charged with? \n\n In August 2019, Todd and Julie Chrisley were indicted by a federal grand jury for tax evasion and other financial crimes, according to court papers previously obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n They were charged with 12 counts of bank and wire fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy. Prosecutors allege that they hid their reality TV income from the IRS through their production company, 7C's Productions, and evaded nearly $2 million in state taxes from 2008 to 2016.\n\n Though the Georgia Department of Revenue cleared the Chrisleys of their $2 million state tax evasion charge in October 2019, their federal charges remained. The couple, who denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to the charges, headed to trial in May 2022.\n\n \u201cWe have nothing to hide and have done nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Todd wrote on Instagram in August 2019. \u201cNot only do we know we\u2019ve done nothing wrong, but we\u2019ve got a ton of hard evidence and a bunch of corroborating witnesses that proves it.\u201d\n\n He continued, \u201cWe know that ... the truth will prevail and the charges against us will be exposed for the outrageous lies they are.\u201d\n\n Who else was involved in Todd and Julie Chrisley\u2019s crimes? \n\n The Chrisleys\u2019 accountant, Peter Tarantino, was also implicated in their alleged financial crimes. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of willfully filing false tax returns.\n\n At trial, Tarantino\u2019s lawyer said that his client was not a criminal but an unqualified accountant who was \u201cin over his head\u201d when it came to handling the Chrisleys\u2019 finances, according to Business Insider. The lawyer also noted that Tarantino had \"failed the CPA exam many times over 20 years.\u201d\n\n But the individual at the center of the federal case against Todd, Julie and Tarantino was Mark Braddock, the Chrisleys' former business partner.\n\n Braddock was fired by the Chrisleys in 2012 and later turned them into the FBI. He cooperated with the prosecution and testified against the Chrisleys during their 2022 trial in exchange for immunity for his involvement in their crimes, which included submitting fake documents to banks to exaggerate the Chrisleys wealth \u2014 in order to borrow more than $30 million to fund their affluent lifestyle.\n\n \u201cThey made up documents and they lie through their teeth to get whatever they want, whenever they want it,\u201d Assistant US Attorney Annalise Peters told the jury in her opening statement, Business Insider reported.\n\n However, Todd\u2019s attorney, Bruce H. Morris, blamed Braddock for impersonating Todd and committing the fraud behind the couple\u2019s back. Todd also revealed on their Chrisley Confessions podcast that Braddock admitted to acting out of revenge while testifying at their trial.\n\n What was the verdict at Todd and Julie Chrisley\u2019s trial? \n\n On June 7, 2022, after a three-week trial, Todd and Julie were found guilty of bank and tax fraud.\n\n The Chrisley Knows Best stars were convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and tax fraud. Julie was also convicted of wire fraud.\n\n \u201cBoth Chrisleys are devastated and disappointed with the verdict and will be pursuing an appeal,\u201d Steve Friedberg, the Chrisleys' lawyer, told PEOPLE in a statement. \u201cJulie and Todd are so grateful for the love and support shown by their family, friends and fans. They both remain strong in their faith and will continue the 'fight' until they are vindicated.\u201d\n\n The Chrisleys\u2019 accountant, Tarantino, was also found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States and willfully filing false tax returns, per Business Insider.\n\n What were Todd and Julie Chrisley\u2019s sentences? \n\n A federal judge handed down the Chrisleys\u2019 sentences in November 2022. Todd received 12 years in prison and 16 months probation, while Julie received seven years in prison plus 16 months probation.\n\n Meanwhile, their accountant, Tarantino, was sentenced to 36 months in prison.\n\n The former reality television stars began to serve their prison sentences on Jan. 17, 2023. Todd checked in to the Federal Prison Camp Pensacola, while Julie reported to the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Ky.\n\n Why did President Trump pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley and when will they be released from prison? \n\n In February 2025, Todd and Julie's legal team announced their intent to file a legal request for a presidential pardon.\n\n \u201cThey believe that the president will seriously consider pardoning both Julie and Todd Chrisley as a result of the unfair treatment they received in the criminal justice system,\u201d Jay Surgent, an attorney for the Chrisleys, told NBC News at the time.\n\n President Trump issued the couple's full pardon three months later. The couple are expected to be released from prison in the coming days.\n\n \"[Trump is] always pleased to give well-deserving Americans a second chance, especially those who have been unfairly targeted and overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, per NBC News.\n\n The couple were initially sentenced to a combined 19 years behind bars, but received shortened prison sentences in September 2023.\n\n Todd\u2019s time behind bars was cut by nearly two years, with his release date pushed up to Jan. 22, 2033. Julie\u2019s sentence was reduced by 14 months, with her release date bumped up to Oct. 19, 2028.\n\n The Chrisleys appealed their convictions and hired new counsel in July 2023 in an attempt to reverse their prison sentences. The legal team argued that there was misconduct that occurred during the Chrisleys\u2019 original trial, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld their convictions in June 2024.\n\n However, the panel of three federal judges vacated Julie\u2019s seven-year prison sentence for tax evasion and bank fraud. The appellate court found that the original trial judge had miscalculated her sentence by holding her responsible for the entire bank fraud scheme, which began in 2006. The judges, though, found insufficient evidence to prove that she was involved before 2007.\n\n In a turn of events, Julie's original sentencing of 84 months or seven years was upheld in September 2024. A judge at the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled that her original punishment was sufficient. Julie was also given five years of supervised release and over $4.7 million in restitution, USA Today reported.\n\n What happened to the Chrisleys\u2019 reality shows? \n\n Following Todd and Julie\u2019s sentencing for their federal financial crimes, their three reality shows \u2014 Chrisley Knows Best, Growing Up Chrisley and Love Limo \u2014 were reportedly canceled.\n\n Episodes of season 10 of Chrisley Knows Best, which were filmed before the couple went to prison, aired in February 2023.\n\n However, in August 2023, the Chrisley family revealed that a new reality series was in the works. The Untitled Chrisleys Project was officially greenlit by Lifetime in May 2025 \u2014 just days before Todd and Julie were granted a presidential pardon.\n\n The show is slated to premiere later this year, and the family will be \"exposing the raw truth of their lives \u2014 past and present.\"\n\n What have Todd and Julie Chrisley said about life in prison? \n\n Todd and Julie\u2019s life behind bars was a \u201cnightmare,\u201d according to their son Chase. In a July 2023 episode of his Unlocked podcast, which he hosts with his sister Savannah, Chase described the allegedly \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions his parents faced in prison.\n\n \u201cThey both have no air, no air conditioning,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey\u2019re both in states where it gets 100-plus degrees, and there\u2019s no air conditioning.\u201d\n\n Savannah added, \u201cI mean, air conditioning is the least of it whenever you\u2019ve got black mold, asbestos and everything, lead-based paint, snakes.\u201d\n\n Todd himself elaborated on the \u201cfilthy\u201d conditions in an interview on the news show Cuomo in November 2023.\n\n \u201cIt is so disgustingly filthy. The food is literally, I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 the food is dated, and it\u2019s out of date by, at minimum, a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a year past expiration. And they are literally starving these men to death here. These men are getting \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 they are getting a thousand calories a day.\"\n\n Adding to the Chrisleys\u2019 misery was their inability to regularly communicate with each other.

Julie was also found guilty of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. And their accountant, Peter Tarantino, was found guilty of multiple tax crimes as well, including conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing two false corporate tax returns on the behalf of the Chrisleys\u2019 company.\nTarantino was sentenced to three years in federal prison, while his former clients Julie and Todd were sentenced to seven and 12 years, respectively. \u201cAs today\u2019s outcome shows, when you lie, cheat and steal, justice is blind as to your fame, your fortune, and your position,\u201d Keri Farley, special agent in charge of FBI Atlanta, said in a statement at the time of the convictions. \u201cIn the end, when driven by greed, the verdict of guilty on all counts for these three defendants proves once again that financial crimes do not pay.\u201d\nBut just three years later, the Chrisleys have seized a get-out-of-jail-free card from President Trump, with their pardons likely to be signed Wednesday, a White House official familiar with the plans told The Washington Post.\nA video posted on X by White House communications adviser Margo Martin shows Trump on a call in the Oval Office with the Chrisleys\u2019 27-year-old daughter, Savannah. \u201cYour parents are going to be free and clean, and I hope we can to do it by tomorrow,\u201d Trump said on the call, joined by his administration\u2019s pardon czar, Alice Marie Johnson. Trump added of the Chrisleys, \u201cThey were given pretty harsh treatment based on what I\u2019m hearing\u2026. I don\u2019t know them, but give them my regards, and wish them a good life.\u201d\nIn a subsequent appearance on NewsNation\u2019s On Balance, Savannah Chrisley said Trump spoke with her on the phone, saying, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t look like terrorists.\u201d Ahead, a breakdown of the Chrisleys\u2019 crimes, conviction, and a reality TV comeback already percolating over on Lifetime.\nWho are the Chrisleys?\nThe Chrisleys shot to fame about a decade ago with the 2014 debut of their USA Network reality show, Chrisley Knows Best. That sitcom-style series follows Todd and Julie, multimillionaire Christian real estate moguls raising five kids in a sprawling Atlanta mansion. On the show, which spawned spin-offs Growing Up Chrisley and According to Chrisley, members of the clan regularly flaunt both their luxurious lifestyle and madcap family dynamics involving Todd\u2019s mother, affectionately known as Nanny Faye.\nBut according to prosecutors in the Chrisley case, their public reputation was \u201cbased on the lie that their wealth came from dedication and hard work.\u201d In fact, the prosecution said, the Chrisleys were \u201ccareer swindlers who have made a living by jumping from one fraud scheme to another, lying to banks, stiffing vendors and evading taxes at every corner.\u201d (The Chrisleys have denied any wrongdoing.)\nThe 10-season run of Chrisley Knows Best ended when the couple began their respective prison sentences in 2023. But their reality-TV empire has not crumbled entirely. According to Variety, cable channel Lifetime has greenlit an untitled docuseries about the family following Todd\u2019s and Julie\u2019s convictions, with elder children Savannah and Chase serving as executive producers.\nAn official synopsis reads: \u201cThe family faces the challenge of carrying on the Chrisley name and legacy on their own with only phone calls and brief visits with their incarcerated parents. While Savannah maintains custody of her younger siblings, Chloe and Grayson, she has been fighting tirelessly for a presidential pardon to free her parents. Meanwhile, Chase is addressing some life struggles while building his new business and navigating his relationship with girlfriend Jodi.\u201d\nWhy did they get sent to prison?\nAround the time that Chrisley Knows Best premiered, in 2014, Todd filed for bankruptcy, while Julie falsified financial documents and lied to real estate agents in order to secure their high-end rental home in Los Angeles, according to the Northern District of Georgia\u2019s Department of Justice. When the pair failed to make rent payments, the property owner filed an eviction lawsuit against the Chrisleys.\nPrior to the start of their reality show, the Chrisleys \u201csubmitted false bank statements, audit reports, and personal financial statements to banks to obtain the millions of dollars in fraudulent loans,\u201d said US attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. The couple then used the funds to obtain expensive cars, designer clothing, travel, and real estate. According to Buchanan, old loans were reimbursed through the use of new, fraudulent ones.\nThen, after earning millions from their reality show, the Chrisleys failed to pay more than half a million dollars in taxes owed by Todd. According to prosecutors, they failed to pay taxes or file returns from 2013 to 2016.\nLast year, an appeals court upheld the convictions of Todd and the Chrisley accountant, Tarantino\u2014but vacated Julie\u2019s sentence, ruling that the sentencing judge had held her liable for the entirety of the bank-fraud scheme without specific evidence pointing to her involvement before 2007.\nSo why is Trump pardoning them?\nShort answer: eldest Chrisley child Savannah is a vocal Trump supporter who has spent time in the MAGA-sphere advocating for her parents\u2019 release.\nLast summer, Savannah spoke at the Republican National Convention, where she claimed the Chrisleys had been \u201cpersecuted by rogue prosecutors\u201d for their conservative beliefs. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget what the prosecutor said in the most heavily Democratic county in the state, before an Obama-appointed judge. He called us the \u2018Trumps of the South,\u2019\u201d she alleged, adding, \u201cHe meant it as an insult. But let me tell you: Boy, do I wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\nSavannah also paid a visit to the White House in March, and earlier this month, was interviewed by the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, on Fox News. And she knows her audience: Trump loves a strategic pardon. In one of his first acts after being sworn into office for a second term, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 of those convicted in connection with the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. On Monday, he offered similar reprieve to Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on fraud and bribery charges.\n\u201cThe president called me personally as I was walking into Sam\u2019s Club and notified me that he was signing paper pardon paperwork for both of my parents,\u201d Savannah said in an Instagram video on Tuesday, May 27. Wearing a gold Make America Great Again hat, she continued, \u201cI will forever be grateful for President Trump, his administration, and everyone along the way, all of my lawyers, the people who put in countless hours, and effort, and love for my family to make sure that my parents got home.\u201d Well-wishers in the comments section include Brittany Aldean, conservative wife of country musician Jason Aldean, and former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak-Biermann.\nThe Chrisleys\u2019 attorney, Alex Little, said in a statement Tuesday that the pardon \u201ccorrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\u201d adding that \u201cTodd and Julie\u2019s case is exactly why the pardon power exists. Thanks to President Trump, the Chrisley family can now begin healing and rebuilding their lives.\u201d", "summary": "Their daughter, Savannah, who also starred on Chrisley Knows Best, is a vocal Trump supporter who called for clemency at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention.", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/why-is-trump-pardoning-julie-and-todd-chrisley-the-reality-tv-couple-convicted-of-fraud", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68371c12f23f424101813263/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/954369980", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 16:57:08", "author": "Savannah Walsh", "authors": ["Savannah Walsh"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.142}, {"id": 325881530, "title": "Who are reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and why did Trump pardon them?", "text": "Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley?\n\nTodd and Julie Chrisley are multimillionaire real estate tycoons based in Atlanta, Georgia. \n\nTheir reality TV series Chrisley Knows Best premiered in 2014 on the USA Network and follows their misadventures with their three grown children.\n\nWhat were the Chrisleys\u2019 crimes?\n\nIn 2022, the Chrisleys were convicted of eight counts of financial fraud and two counts of tax evasion.

Rodgers recently appeared in a Netflix docuseries about his life and also contemplated becoming Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s running mate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, during his last two seasons with the Jets, Rodgers\u2019 use of hallucinogenic drug retreats and his absence from team workouts in the summertime have led to criticism as his results on the field waned.\n\n \"I'm in a different phase of my life,\" Rodgers explained on The Pat McAfee Show last month. \"I'm 41 years old, I'm in a serious relationship. I have off-the-field stuff going on that requires my attention. I have personal commitments I made not knowing what my future was going to look like after last year, that are important to me.\"\n\n Rodgers argued that he isn\u2019t \u201cholding anybody hostage\u201d with his indecision about playing next season, as the Steelers appear to be waiting to hear back.

NFL on FOX analyst Terry Bradshaw criticized his former team's interest in Rodgers during an appearance on 103.7 The Buzz's \"Morning Mayhem\" in Arkansas, calling it a \"joke.\" \"That's a joke. That to me is just a joke,\" Bradshaw said. \"What are you going to do? Bring him in for one year. Are you kidding me? That guy needs to stay in California. Go somewhere and chew on bark and whisper to the Gods out there.\" Rodgers has been linked to the Steelers ever since free agency opened in March. While the two sides haven't agreed to a deal quite yet, both parties have indicated that they're hopeful a contract agreement will happen at some point. In fact, Rodgers dropped another hint over the weekend that he's likely to end up in Pittsburgh for the 2025 NFL season. As for the Steelers' side, president Art Rooney II told reporters at the league meetings last week that that team is willing to wait \"a little while longer\" for Rodgers to make his decision. In April, Rooney told Steelers Nation Radio that Rodgers \"does want to come here.\" The Steelers' entanglement with Rodgers is just the latest swing they've made at quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger retired at the end of the 2021 season. They brought in veterans Russell Wilson and Justin Fields prior to the 2024 season in hopes that either would elevate their roster, which had made the postseason the year prior. Wilson helped Pittsburgh make the playoffs again in 2024, but he faltered down the stretch, leading the team to let him to walk in free agency. However, Bradshaw thinks the biggest mistake the Steelers have made at quarterback over the last few years was their development of 2022 first-round pick Kenny Pickett, who was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024. \"I liked Kenny Pickett,\" Bradshaw said. \"I liked him at Pitt. I know him, I know what he's like. When they got him to Pittsburgh, they didn't protect him, they didn't get him an offensive line. They wanted to run the football, but they didn't have an offensive line that could protect and they didn't have weapons. He had no wide receivers to speak of.\" \"Then they throw a kid in there for two years, and you've got an offense that doesn't fit and doesn't work, and they can't run because their offensive line's not even good enough for a run-blocking team. Now, they're saying Kenny Pickett is a failure. He wasn't a failure, the Steelers were a failure.\" FOX Sports' Colin Cowherd seems to agree with Bradshaw about the Steelers' approach to the quarterback position over the last few years. On Wednesday's \"The Herd,\" Cowherd noted that Rodgers is opting to sit out voluntary practices while other star quarterbacks, such as Josh Allen, are still practicing with their respective teams. But he also thinks the Steelers aren't blameless in failing to get Rodgers signed at this point, either. \"Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers have something in common: Neither takes the duty of quarterback with great urgency,\" Cowherd said. \"Both the Steelers and Aaron have a \u2018We\u2019ll get to it eventually,' \u2018I\u2019ll sign with a team eventually\u2019 or \u2018We\u2019ll figure out the quarterback eventually' [approach]. Think about San Francisco and Kyle Shanahan, they just signed Brock Purdy to a massive deal and yet, this year in the draft, Kyle says, \u2018I want another quarterback\u2019 and they draft a kid out of Indiana. The Green Bay Packers, they draft quarterbacks three years before they let them see the field. \"The Pittsburgh Steelers lost their left tackle, their top two quarterbacks, their top receiver and a really good running back in Najee Harris, and their answer is, \u2018Eh, we think Aaron\u2019s our quarterback, but we're not really sure.' The Steelers have become the 66-year-old guy who has never put a penny in his 401K and is trying to convince us that [he's got a plan].\" For much of the offseason, Cowherd had questioned Rodgers' fit with the Steelers and wondered if he and head coach Mike Tomlin would mesh. After Bradshaw's take on the situation, though, he's reconsidered that stance. \"I had an epiphany. I had been saying Aaron and the Steelers are a bad fit. I'm wrong. It's a great fit,\" Cowherd said. \"In life, what's the rule? You've got to find someone who matches your energy? The Steelers at quarterback: \u2018We\u2019ll get to it.' Aaron on committing: \u2018Eh, maybe later.\u2019 \"I am here for the dysfunction. The whole time, I've been like, \u2018This is a weird fit.\u2019 There's a reason the Steelers are near the top of the NFL in longest playoff win droughts. \u2026 More than ever, it's much easier to predict who's going to win each division based on who has the best quarterback, does he have a good offensive coach and do they treat the position with importance and urgency. Steelers don't, Aaron doesn't. It's a match made in heaven.\" Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Game 5, a do-or-die situation for the Knicks, is scheduled for Thursday night at Madison Square Garden.\n\nGame 4 was played at the Pacers\u2019 tempo from the opening tip. The Knicks\u2019 new starting five was -5 in its first quarter run, while the Pacers had a 159.3 offensive rating in the first quarter, which is why they led by 8 after one. The Knicks made a comeback, using a 9-2 run in the second quarter with the bench in and Brunson resting, and tied the game at 51-51. New York slowed the game down in the second with that bench lineup.\n\nHowever, in the fourth quarter, with the game on the line, Thibodeau leaned back into his former starting lineup \u2014 playing Josh Hart but not Mitchell Robinson \u2014 and while that lineup was +5 for the game it could not close the gap at the end. The Knicks again looked worn down by the Pacers\u2019 pace of play.\n\n\u201cJust the hustle, making defensive transition, getting more continuity into the offense,\u201d Thibodeau said of why he leaned into Hart in the fourth, rather than going with the bench group that has done well the past two games. \n\nJalen Brunson led the Knicks with 31 points with five assists, while Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 and OG Anunoby 22.\n\nTowns injured his knee in the final minutes in a collision with Aaron Nesmith (where Myles Turner was called for the foul following a review for shoving Towns into Nesmith). This is the same knee he had meniscus surgery on in 2024 and he was limping and flexing that knee the rest of the game. However, he stayed in the game and said he would be good to go in Game 5.\n\nHaliburton got more help with Pascal Siakam adding 30 points and Aaron Nesmith adding 16.\n\n\u201cHe stole a lot of my rebounds,\u201d Siakam joked about Haliburton. \u201cHe was amazing\u2026 I just love the way he played tonight, his energy.\u201d\n\nThe Knicks now have to win three straight games to advance to the NBA Finals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never known this team to quit,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the character of the guys we have in the locker room.\u201d\n\nMore than not quitting, the Knicks need to slow down the tempo of the game \u2014 and provide Brunson and Towns with consistent help \u2014 to have a chance at those wins.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA major question looming before the series began was whether the Knicks&#8217;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Tyrese Haliburton&#8217;s Triple-Double Propels Pacers to 3-1 Series Lead Over New York first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/local-news/tyrese-haliburtons-triple-double-propels-pacers-to-3-1-series-lead-over-new-york/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tyrese-Haliburton039s-triple-double-sparks-Pacers-Indiana-runs-past-New-York.com2Frest2Fdownload2FimageID3D26301356.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 05:35:19", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.084}, {"id": 325629526, "title": "[Post Game Thread] The Indiana Pacers defeat the New York Knicks, 130-121, to take a 3-1 lead behind Haliburton's 32 point, 12 rebound, 15 assist and 0 turnover triple double.", "text": "You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer tokenIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.Log in File a ticket", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kx6ar3/post_game_thread_the_indiana_pacers_defeat_the/", "image": null, "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 02:49:33", "author": "u/sptagnew", "authors": ["u/sptagnew"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -1.0}, {"id": 325635974, "title": "Tyrese Haliburton's triple-double sparks Pacers, Indiana runs past New York to 3-1 series lead", "text": "It was one of the key questions heading into the series: Could the Knicks\u2019 defense slow the uptempo Pacers\u2019 offense enough to give themselves a chance?

No, not that Gabriel. Reeves' character is more of a \"budget guardian angel.\"Written and directed by Aziz Ansari (Parks and Recreation, Master of None) in his feature directorial debut, Good Fortune centers on Gabriel's attempts to prove himself as a guardian angel. Usually stuck with helping people who are choking or texting while driving, Gabriel yearns for more meaningful duties. That means finding a lost soul and teaching them how beautiful their life can be.Gabriel finds such a soul in struggling gig worker Arj (Ansari).

I want to guide people. I want to change their lives\", he tells his angelic boss (played by Sandra Oh). \"To save a lost soul, you have to find a lost soul,\" she answers, kickstarting a journey of self-discovery where not everything goes according to plan.\nGabriel finds a struggling worker, Arj (Ansari), who has quite a materialistic view of life. The angel wants to prove that money can't buy happiness, so he body-swaps him with his wealthy employer, Jeff (Seth Rogen). The results are quite the opposite of what he intended \u2013 Arj is, in fact, much happier with his new luxurious life than he was before.\n\nYou may like\n\nPedro Pascal's new R-rated romance with Dakota Johnson and Chris Evans feels like a classic ode to cult rom-coms past in first trailer\n\nKeanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock plan third screen reunion in romantic thriller for Amazon\n\nJustin Lin to helm Keanu Reeves' comic book movie adaptation BRZRKR for Netflix\n\nThe film marks the directorial debut of Ansari, who is best known for his critically-acclaimed TV series Master of None and his stand-up work. With Good Fortune, he hopes to revive the kind of comedies Rogen would star on fifteen years ago on the big screen.\n\n\"I was just on tour doing stand-up, and being in a packed room, laughing with a group of people, it is such an experience,\" he told Entertainment Weekly.\n\"The idea of someone watching these movies by themselves at home....,\" he continued, \"I mean, look, I want people to see the movie, whatever, but there's a difference between doing a stand-up show for a packed theater and a comedy club with four people in the audience. One of those experiences is a lot more fun than the other.\"\nGood Fortune is set to be released in theaters on October 17.

His removal occurred in March following an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Maryland, which his lawyers call unlawful and retaliatory.\n\nIn court filings, the DOJ recounted that Abrego Garcia \u201cviolated United States law in 2011 by entering the country without inspection\u201d and noted that he was charged in 2019 as inadmissible under federal immigration law. ICE officials later told a judge he posed a public safety risk based on a gang field interview sheet produced by Maryland police, and an immigration judge agreed.\n\nDOJ attorneys wrote that the outcome Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys are asking for, his return to the U.S., depends on the \u201cchoices of [an] independent actor,\u201d the government of El Salvador, which the court has no authority over. \u201cIt is speculative that directing Defendants to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return would redress Plaintiffs\u2019 injury,\u201d the attorneys argued.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously ruled that the Trump administration must \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return, but Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has declined to release him from a detention center, President Donald Trump has said repeatedly. But at the same time, the justices rejected a lower court judge\u2019s determination that the Salvadoran\u2019s return should also be \u201ceffectuated\u201d by the government, leading to courtroom disputes over the meaning of the high court\u2019s ruling.\n\nJudge Paula Xinis, who previously rebuked DOJ lawyers for failing to answer questions about the deportation, is expected to decide whether to grant the administration\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Trump team says the ruling must reflect that \u201cthe irreducible constitutional minimum\u201d of standing, or the ability of plaintiffs to bring the lawsuit in the first place, has not been met.\n\nThe administration also invoked 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g), which bars courts from reviewing executive branch actions related to removal orders, arguing that Abrego Garcia\u2019s challenge \u201cplainly arises from the government\u2019s \u2018decision or action\u2019 to execute his removal order.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendants removed Abrego Garcia pursuant to a lawful removal order,\u201d the motion stated. \u201cWhether or not he had been served a warrant for removal does not change that fact.\u201d\n\nThe case has drawn attention from Congress, where Democrats, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Glenn Ivey, both of Maryland, have demanded answers and attempted to visit Abrego Garcia in prison.\n\nThe Trump administration pushed back aggressively in a post on X. \u201cKilmar Abrego Garcia is a confirmed MS-13 gang member, wife beater, human trafficker, and illegal alien from El Salvador \u2014 not your constituent,\u201d DHS wrote on X in response to Ivey\u2019s video about her attempted visit. \u201c@POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem are fighting for the victims of alien crime and putting the safety of Americans FIRST.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen countered, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about Mr. Abrego Garcia \u2014 this is about defending the rights of ALL. Shameful.\u201d\n\nMARYLAND CONGRESSMAN SAYS HE WAS DENIED ACCESS TO CONSTITUENT KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA IN EL SALVADOR\n\nJust before filing the request to dismiss the case on Tuesday, the Trump administration also sought to delay a May 30 deadline to hand over additional discovery files. Xinis quickly rebuffed that request, citing that there have already been at least \u201cfive hearings\u201d and \u201cat no point have defendants even intimated they needed more time to answer or otherwise respond.\u201d\n\nXinis has not said when she will rule on the government\u2019s motion.", "summary": "The Trump administration asked a federal court late Tuesday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and suspected MS-13 gang member deported earlier this year under disputed circumstances, arguing the court has no jurisdiction to force his return to the United States.

They contend that although the government mistakenly sent him to a well-known Salvadorean work prison without proper legal procedures, his stay in that Central American nation implies that he is not under U.S. custody, thus the court does not have the authority to adjudicate the case.\n\nIn a 13-page motion submitted on Tuesday to U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, the Justice Department stated that \u201cthe Court must dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u201d due to the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, indicating that Abrego Garcia\u2019s situation \u201cis not addressable by this court.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s jurisdiction argument target\u2019s Abrego Garcia\u2019s threshold habeas claim, which is a challenge to the legality of an individual\u2019s detainment \u2014 one that must be filed in the jurisdiction where the individual is being held.\n\nFrom the filing (citations removed):\n\nPlaintiffs admit that Abrego Garcia \u201cis being held in custody by the Government of El Salvador.\u201d And they acknowledge that Defendants do not have the power to produce him (asking the Court to order Defendants to \u201crequest that the Government of El Salvador release Plaintiff\u201d to Defendants\u2019 custody (emphasis added)). Despite their allegations that \u201cthe Government of El Salvador is detaining Plaintiff Abrego Garcia at the direct request \u2026 and financial compensation of Defendants,\u201d Plaintiffs do not assert that the United States can exercise its will over a foreign sovereign. The most they ask for is that this Court order the United States to \u201crequest\u201d his release. This is not \u201ccustody\u201d to which the great writ may run.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s filing claims its position on jurisdiction does not run contra to orders issued by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, both of which ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the country. Neither of the higher courts directly addressed the issue of jurisdiction.\n\nLove true crime?

In a brief three-paragraph order, the judge briefly reviewed the contentious case history and what she views as the government\u2019s repeated flouting of her directives.\n\nDespite President Donald Trump earlier this month telling ABC News he \u201ccould\u201d just pick up the phone and have El Salvador return Abrego Garcia, the DOJ on Tuesday said the Defendants \u201cdo not have the power to produce him.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The Defendants] vaguely complain, in two sentences, to expending \u2018significant resources\u2019 engaging in expedited discovery,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut these self-described burdens are of their own making. The Court ordered expedited discovery because of Defendants\u2019 refusal to follow the orders of this Court as affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that during the five court hearings in the case, the DOJ had never \u201ceven intimated\u201d that they needed more time to file their response until the day of the filing deadline.\n\n\u201cThus, to say now that additional time is needed to do that which the law requires rings hollow,\u201d she wrote.\n\nXinis has previously upbraided the administration for ignoring court orders to produce information regarding Abrego Garcia\u2019s detention and the steps being taken to facilitate his return and for allegedly \u201cmischaracterizing\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s April order.\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case has garnered international attention, quickly becoming one of the most high-profile and combative lawsuits amid the blizzard of legal challenges filed against Trump and his administration since he retook office in January. The government has conceded in numerous filings that he removal to El Salvador was an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d but has steadfastly insisted that he is a member of MS-13 and refused to cooperate with multiple court orders demanding he be brought back to the country.\n\nNotably, the government has proffered little, if any, evidence that Abrego Garcia was a gang member. He has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador and has submitted sworn statements that he was fleeing El Salvador due to gang violence.", "summary": "Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMain: President Donald Trump during an event focused on energy production in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Administration Urges Judge to Dismiss Abrego Garcia Case first appeared on Internewscast Journal", "url": "https://internewscast.com/crime/trump-administration-urges-judge-to-dismiss-abrego-garcia-case/", "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Judge-lashes-out-at-DOJ-for-noncompliance-over-deported-dad.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 17:29:17", "author": "Internewscast", "authors": ["Internewscast"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.342}, {"id": 325893990, "title": "US files motion to dismiss lawsuit over Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation", "text": "By BEN FINLEY\n\nThe Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit over Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2019s mistaken deportation to El Salvador, arguing the court lacks jurisdiction because he\u2019s no longer in the United States.\n\nThe request for dismissal late Tuesday was a procedural move by the U.S. government, which was required to respond to Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawsuit within 60 days.

U.S. attorneys reiterated their arguments from late March against his return.\n\nThe government\u2019s filing is the latest development in a case that has carried on for two months without any discernible movement toward resolution, despite a judge\u2019s order to bring back Abrego Garcia and a subsequent Supreme Court ruling to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told ABC News in late April that he could retrieve Abrego Garcia with a phone call to El Salvador\u2019s president. But Trump said he wouldn\u2019t do it because Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he was never charged.\n\nTrump administration attorneys have not used the president\u2019s plainspoken explanation inside the Maryland federal court that ordered Abrego Garcia\u2019s return. They\u2019ve argued that information about returning Abrego Garcia is protected by the state secrets privilege, a legal doctrine often used in military cases.\n\nU.S. attorneys said releasing such details in open court \u2014 or even to the judge in private \u2013 would jeopardize national security by revealing sensitive diplomatic negotiations. Many filings in the case have been sealed.\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys have argued that the Trump administration has done nothing to return the Maryland construction worker. They say the government is invoking the privilege to hide behind the misconduct of mistakenly deporting him and refusing to bring him back.\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shielded Abrego Garcia from expulsion to his native country. The immigration judge determined that Abrego Garcia faced likely persecution by a local Salvadoran gang that terrorized his family.\n\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s American wife sued over his deportation, and U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered his return on April 4. The Supreme Court ruled on April 10 that the administration must work to bring him back.\n\nXinis is yet to rule on the U.S. government\u2019s state secrets claim.

Lanier\u2019s attorney Joshua Koskoff told The Associated Press that the resolution is an \u201cunprecedented\u201d victory for descendants of those enslaved in the U.S. and praised his client\u2019s yearslong determination in pursuing justice for her ancestors.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of one in American history, because of the combination of unlikely features: to have a case that dates back 175 years, to win control over images dating back that long of enslaved people \u2014 that\u2019s never happened before,\u201d Koskoff said.\n\nIn a statement, Harvard said it had \u201clong been eager to place the Zealy Daguerreotypes with another museum or other public institution to put them in the appropriate context and increase access to them for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis settlement now allows us to move forward towards that goal,\u201d the university said. \u201cWhile we are grateful to Ms. Lanier for sparking important conversations about these images, this was a complex situation, particularly since Harvard has not confirmed that Ms. Lanier was related to the individuals in the daguerreotypes.\u201d\n\nA complex history\n\nLanier, who lives in Connecticut, sued the Ivy League school in 2019 for \u201cwrongful seizure, possession and expropriation\u201d of the images of Renty, Delia and five other enslaved individuals. The suit attacked Harvard for its \u201cexploitation\u201d of Renty\u2019s image at a 2017 conference and in other uses. It said Harvard has capitalized on the photos by demanding a \u201chefty\u201d licensing fee to reproduce the images.\n\nThe daguerreotypes were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, whose theories on racial difference were used to support slavery in the U.S. The lawsuit says Agassiz came across Renty and Delia while touring plantations in search of racially \u201cpure\u201d slaves born in Africa.\n\nTo create the images, both Renty and Delia were posed shirtless and photographed from several angles.\n\n\u201cTo Agassiz, Renty and Delia were nothing more than research specimens,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThe violence of compelling them to participate in a degrading exercise designed to prove their own subhuman status would not have occurred to him, let alone mattered.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in Lanier\u2019s favor and reaffirmed the merits of Lanier\u2019s lawsuit against Harvard after a lower court judge ruled she had no legal claim to the images.\n\nThe state\u2019s highest court recognized \u201cHarvard\u2019s complicity in the horrific actions surrounding the creation of the daguerreotypes,\u201d saying that \u201cHarvard\u2019s present obligations cannot be divorced from its past abuses.\u201d\n\nA new home for Renty and Delia\n\nTonya M.

House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., voted \"present.\" The bill is a victory for Trump and House Republicans, who overcame policy disagreements to deliver on Trump's key campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts and no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security.

Trump said the commission would conclude its work by July 4, 2026. Ramaswamy left DOGE in January, leaving Musk as its sole leader.Musk had lofty goals for DOGE. In October, Musk said DOGE would save at least $2 trillion for the government. He later said in January that saving $2 trillion would be a \"best-case outcome\" and DOGE had a \"good shot\" at saving $1 trillion.Last month, Musk told reporters DOGE saved $160 billion in federal spending and cut 20,000 government jobs, or about 1% of the federal workforce.\"In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I'd like. I think we could be more effective.

Much of that increase in the deficit comes from extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans by another decade. Republicans have proposed paying for the tax cuts by cutting Medicaid and Medicare by hundreds of billions of dollars, though because the tax cuts are so costly, any deficit reduction made by those cuts is minimal.\n\nOne of the most outspoken opponents of the bill among the Senate Republican Conference is Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who has repeatedly harped on the legislation's sky-high price tag. In addition to Johnson, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) have also indicated their plans to oppose it.\n\nREAD MORE: 'It's working!'

The plan, passed without any Democratic support, calls for imposing work requirements on Medicaid recipients and slashes grants to states that had expanded the pool of eligible participants.\n\nBut despite taking an ax to social spending, the Republican reconciliation plan would also dramatically increase the federal deficit. An analysis from the University of Pennsylvania found that the bill would increase the federal deficit by at least $2.8 trillion over the next decade. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the finally number could even be as high as $3.8 trillion.\n\nThat is largely due to the tax cuts included in the bill, which disproportionately benefit higher-income households. The process of collecting tax revenue is also likely to be adversely affected by layoffs at the IRS imposed by Musk and his DOGE operatives.\n\nSpeaking to CBS, Musk, who has claimed he is reducing his involvement in GOP politics to focus on his duties at Tesla, blamed Republicans for failing to further slash federal spending \u2014 and, implicitly, President Donald Trump, who has endorsed the bill.\n\n\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both,\" Musk said. \"My personal opinion.\"", "summary": "In an interview released Tuesday night, Musk complained that the bill would increase the federal deficit", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2025/05/28/musk-splitting-with-trump-says-hes-disappointed-by-the-gops-massive-spending-bill/", "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/03/elon-musk-2206725167.jpg ?>", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 15:31:26", "author": "Charles R.

They did owe the state money for one year ($214,118 in 2009) and agreed to pay just under $150,000 to settle the case.\n\nIn a press release, Todd said he and Julie \"knew all along that we had done nothing wrong and that when the facts all came out, we would be fine.\"\n\nHowever, the couple was not out of the woods completely \u2014 while this was going on, a federal grand jury in Atlanta had indicted the couple on charges of conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion.", "summary": "President Trump said he'll pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley.

They were also found guilty of tax evasion, obscuring their earnings while showcasing a luxurious way of living that authorities said included high-priced cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.\n\nProsecutors said the couple walked away from their responsibility for repayment when Todd Chrisley declared bankruptcy and left $20-plus million in unpaid loans. Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years in federal prison, and Todd Chrisley got 12 years behind bars. The couple was also ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution.\n\n\u201cYour parents are going to be free and clean and I hope that we can do it by tomorrow,\u201d Trump said in a call with their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, according to a video posted online by a White House aide. In a social media post, the aide declared, \u201cTrump Knows Best!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I\u2019m hearing,\u201d the president added a few moments later of the couple.\n\nA White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss decisions that hadn\u2019t yet been made public, said the pardons would be forthcoming.\n\nThe move continues a pattern of Trump pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers. On Monday, Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on fraud and bribery charges. The president posted online that Jenkins and his family \u201chave been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\u201d\n\nThe president has also moved to pardon Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive imprisoned on tax charges, whose mother helped expose the contents of a diary kept by Ashley Biden, daughter of former President Joe Biden. And, in April, he pardoned Nevada Republican Michele Fiore, who was awaiting sentencing on federal charges that she used money meant for a statue honoring a slain police officer for personal costs, including plastic surgery.\n\nThe Chrisleys\u2019 attorney, Alex Little, said the pardon \u201ccorrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump recognized what we\u2019ve argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias,\u201d Little said in a statement.\n\nLittle\u2019s statement added, \u201cTodd and Julie\u2019s case is exactly why the pardon power exists. Thanks to President Trump, the Chrisley family can now begin healing and rebuilding their lives.\u201d\n\nBefore the Chrisleys became reality television stars, they, and a former business partner, submitted false documents to banks in the Atlanta area to obtain fraudulent loans, prosecutors said during their trial. They accused the couple of spending lavishly, then using new fraudulent loans to pay off old ones.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last summer upheld the Chrisleys\u2019 convictions but found a legal error in how the trial judge had calculated Julie Chrisley\u2019s sentence by holding her accountable for the entire bank fraud scheme. The appellate panel sent her case back to the lower court for resentencing.\n\nSavannah Chrisley spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where she talked about her parents\u2019 imprisonment. She said then that they were \u201cpersecuted by rogue prosecutors\u201d \u2014 echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric about the criminal justice system as he faced investigations and criminal cases of his own.\n\nShe said Trump had been targeted for his politics, and said her parents likewise were targeted because of their conservative beliefs and high profile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget what the prosecutors said in the most heavily Democratic county in the state, before an Obama-appointed judge. He called us the \u2018Trumps of the South,\u2019\u201d Savannah Chrisley said in her remarks at the convention, adding, \u201cHe meant it as an insult but, let me tell you, boy, do I wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

In a pardon petition, the family alleged that the conviction was based on an illegal raid and relied on compromised evidence.\n\nSavannah Chrisley also campaigned for Trump as a prison reform advocate. She spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024.\n\nSince being incarcerated, the Chrisleys have become known as federal prison reform advocates, pushing for better conditions in federal prisons.\n\nIn November 2022, Todd was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison while Julie received a seven-year sentence. The couple has appealed their conviction and maintained their innocence.\n\nA release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia at the time said that the couple had specifically defrauded Atlanta-area banks of more than $36 million in personal loans.\n\n\u201cThe Chrisleys, with the help of their former business partner, submitted false bank statements, audit reports, and personal financial statements to Georgia community banks to obtain the loans.

But after the IRS requested information about bank accounts in Julie Chrisley\u2019s name, the Chrisleys transferred ownership of the corporate bank account to a relative to further conceal their income from the IRS.\u201d\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, the couple did not file a tax return, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThe couple is best known for their reality TV show \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which followed the family, centering around Todd\u2014who presented himself as a successful real estate tycoon. The show was filmed in the suburbs of Atlanta, before moving to Nashville during later seasons.\n\n\u201cGrowing Up Chrisley,\u201d a spin-off focusing on Chase and Savannah Chrisley, premiered in 2019.\n\nThe pardons come after Trump announced that he would pardon Scott Jenkins, former sheriff of Virginia\u2019s Culpeper County, who received a 10-year prison sentence following a federal bribery conviction.\n\nIn January, the president also issued broad pardons for some of those arrested in connection with the events of Jan. 6, 2021.", "summary": "Julie and Todd Chrisley were convicted of defrauding Atlanta-area community banks out of more than $30 million through fraudulent loans in 2022.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/entertainment/trump-announces-pardons-for-couple-convicted-of-bank-fraud-5864179", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/01/15/id5565997-Todd-and-Julie-Chrisley-e1668987644364-615x347-1-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 01:59:27", "author": "Joseph Lord", "authors": ["Joseph Lord"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.202}, {"id": 325585906, "title": "Donald Trump Grants Pardon to Reality TV Stars Todd and Julie Chrisley", "text": "TCF vendors\n\nExponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Probabilistic identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Non-precise location data, Users\u2019 profiles, Privacy choicesmoreCookie duration resets each session.

They were found guilty in 2022 of manipulating financial records to make it appear as if they were wealthier than they really were, when applying for more than $30 million in loans from 2007 to 2012.\n\nThey received a combined 19-year prison sentence, with Todd Chrisley to serve 12 years in prison and Julie Chrisley sentenced to serve seven. Both sentences came with three years' supervised release.\n\nTrump, a former reality star, is expected to grant the couple the latest presidential pardons of his second administration.\n\nIn a video excerpt published on X by a White House aide of a phone call Tuesday between Trump and the jailed couple's adult children, the president is heard stating, \"your parents are going to be free and clean, and I hope we can do that by tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I don't know them, but give them my regards and wish them a good life.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for bringing my parents back,\" Grayson Chrisley is heard responding.\n\n\"Yeah, well, they were given a pretty harsh treatment from what I'm hearing,\" Trump replied.\n\nMargo Martin, the White House aide who published the clip online, said in the caption that Trump will be granting them \"full pardons.\"\n\n\"Trump Knows Best!\" she added.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference said in a statement that it \"appreciates\" Trump's pardoning of Todd and Julie Chrisley, the parents of its Nolan Center for Justice senior fellow, Savannah Chrisley, who was on the phone call Tuesday with Trump.\n\n\"The Chrisleys were targeted by weaponized prosecutors who abused the power granted to them by our criminal justice system,\" CPAC said in a statement.\n\n\"Thank you to President Trump for restoring order and integrity to the justice system.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the Chrisleys, who were found guilty in June 2022, spent money they defrauded from banks to purchase luxury cars, real estate and travel and then used new fraudulent loans to pay off the old loans.\n\nTodd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from $20 million in debt. On top of the conspiracy to defraud banks, they were found guilty of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Julie Chrisley was also found guilty of wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has used his executive powers to punish political adversaries with executive orders and to seemingly reward convicted friends, supporters and donors with presidential pardons.\n\nOn Monday, Trump pardoned disgraced former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins who was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment after a federal court found he accepted tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to appoint local businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. The president described Jenkins as being a victim of a \"corrupt and weaponized Biden\" Department of Justice.\n\nLast month, Trump pardoned Paul Walczak, a former nursing home executive who was sentenced to 18 months in jail for tax crimes and whose mother had raised millions for the New York real estate mogul's campaigns.\n\nIn March, he also pardoned Devon Archer, a former business associate of Hunter Biden who was sentenced to a year and a day in prison in 2022 for a scheme to defraud a Native American community. However, he testified against the Biden family during the Republicans' failed investigation to try and impeach former President Joe Biden.", "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, former television stars serving lengthy prison terms after being found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks and committing tax evasion.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/27/Trump-Pardon-Todd-Julie-Chrisley/6451748397915/", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6451748397915/2025/upi/cafc7d3be245fd9f5d20a61b1f1d3818/v1.2/Trump-to-pardon-ex-reality-TV-stars-Todd-and-Julie-Chrisley.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 03:19:39", "author": "Darryl Coote", "authors": ["Darryl Coote"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.097}]}, {"news": [{"id": 325618212, "title": "Hugh Jackman\u2019s Ex-Wife Deborra-Lee Furness Breaks Her Silence on \u2018Betrayal\u2019 as Their Divorce Is Finalized", "text": "Hugh Jackman\u2019s ex-wife Deborra-Lee Furness is speaking out for the first time since filing for divorce from the actor.\n\n \u201cMy heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,\u201d the 69-year-old Australian actress said in a statement to the Daily Mail Tuesday, May 27.\n\n Furness and the Deadpool & Wolverine star, 56, wed in 1996 before announcing their amicable separation in 2023 after 27 years of marriage.\n\n She called their split \u201ca profound wound that cuts deep.\u201d\n\n \u201cHowever I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us,\u201d Furness said. \u201cThis belief has helped me navigate the breakdown of an almost three-decade marriage.\u201d \n\n According to the producer and philanthropist, the process has helped her as she \u201cgained much knowledge and wisdom.\u201d \n\n \u201cEven when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose.

She described their split as \"a profound wound that cuts deep.\"Furness had been married to the Wolverine actor for 27 years. They have two children together: Oscar, 25, and Ava, 20.Jackman is in a new relationship with actor Sutton Foster, whom he has known since 2008. The pair started working together on the 2021 Broadway revival of \"The Music Man.\" In late 2024, it was rumored that they were dating after Foster filed for divorce from her husband, Ted Griffin. In January, Jackman and Foster went public with their relationship when they were photographed holding hands in LA.Representatives for Jackman and Furness didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.As the former couple wait for their divorce to be finalized, here's a timeline of their relationship.The pair met on the set of the drama series \"Correlli,\" People reported. Jackman told the outlet there was an instant connection.\"I knew two weeks into meeting Deb that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives,\" Jackman told \"Today\" in 2018.A few weeks after meeting her, Jackman told People he confessed his feelings for Furness. She reciprocated, and four months later, he asked her to marry him.\"Deb, she was a big star,\" Jackman told People in 2017. \"I get picked up, and Deb is in the front seat of the car. I'll never forget. She took off her seatbelt and she turned around and put out her hand and took off her sunglasses and said, 'Hi, I'm Deborra-Lee Furness, nice to meet you.' I remember thinking, 'I like this girl.'\"A post shared by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman)On April 11, 1996, the couple tied the knot at a church outside of Melbourne, Australia, per People.On their 25th wedding anniversary in 2021, Jackman shared a photo to Instagram captioned: \"Being married to you Deb is as natural as breathing.\"\"From nearly the moment we met ... I knew our destiny was to be together,\" his post continued. \"In our 25 years - our love has only grown deeper. The fun, excitement and adventure more exhilarating; the learning even greater. I'm forever grateful to share our love, our life - and, our family together. We've only just begun. Deb, I love you with all my heart!\"\"We struggled, a couple miscarriages, IVF \u2014 it's not easy, particularly on Deb,\" Jackman told People in 2017.They adopted their son, Oscar, in 2000. They adopted their daughter, Ava, in 2005. Oscar is now 25, and Ava is now 19.\"Our motivation behind adopting was, 'Where is the need?'\" Jackman told People. \"The biggest need is in mixed-race kids. I want to tell my kids that \u2026 it doesn't matter what sexual [orientation] you are, it doesn't matter what job you do, it doesn't matter whether your hair is straight or curly, if you're tall or short, man or woman, what race you are. What defines you as a human being is underneath all that.\"The pair made their final appearance as a couple at the 2023 Met Gala, where they walked the red carpet in coordinating black outfits.Jackman wore a black tux, while Furness donned a floor-length gown with a mosaic pattern.Five months after celebrating their 27th anniversary, the pair announced their separation.In a statement shared with People, the former couple called their 27 years together a \"loving marriage\" and said their \"journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.\"At the time, they also said this would be their \"sole statement\" on the subject.After being separated for almost two years, Furness filed for divorce.Business Insider confirmed that the divorce was filed on May 23, 2025 in New York.Furness also filed a handful of other documents regarding child support, ongoing healthcare coverage, and affidavits for both parties, suggesting that the former couple has already figured out the finer details of the divorce away from the spotlight.Four days later, on May 27, Furness shared a statement with the Daily Mail that read: \"My heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal.\"\"It's a profound wound that cuts deep, however, I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us. This belief has helped me navigate the breakdown of an almost three-decade marriage,\" she continued.She ended the statement noting that the one thing she's learned throughout her experience is that \"that none of this is personal.\"\"We are all on our individual journeys and I believe that the relationships in our lives are not random,\" she added. \"We are drawn to people, we invite them in, in order to learn our lessons and to recognize and heal the broken parts of ourselves...I remain grateful.\"Libby Torres and Jordan Parker Erb contributed to a previous version of this story.", "summary": "Hugh Jackman and his wife announced they were separating in 2023.

Today\u2019s NYT Strands hints, spangram and answers for Thursday, May 28 are coming right up.\n\nHow To Play Strands\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Strands puzzle is a play on the classic word search. It\u2019s available on the NYT website and in the NYT Games app alongside the likes of Wordle and Connections (which we also cover in daily guides at Forbes Gaming).\n\nThere\u2019s a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you\u2019ll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links at least two sides of the board, but it may not start or end there. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nIf You Get This Message On Your Phone It\u2019s An Attack\n\nMusk \u2018Disappointed\u2019 With Trump\u2019s Spending Bill\u2014Says It Undermines DOGE\u2019s Work\n\nGoogle\u2019s New Chrome Update\u2014Do Not Ignore June 5 Deadline\n\nEvery letter is used once in one of the theme words and spangram. You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it\u2019s possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you\u2019re playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess.\n\nIf you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you\u2019ll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words.\n\nBe warned: You\u2019ll need to be on your toes. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to fill the missing word(s) in a phrase. On other days, the game may revolve around synonyms or homophones. The difficulty will vary from day to day, and the puzzle creators will try to surprise you sometimes.\n\nWhat Is Today\u2019s Strands Hint?\n\nScroll slowly! Just after the hint for today\u2019s Strands puzzle, I\u2019ll reveal what the answer words are.\n\nThe official theme hint for today\u2019s Strands puzzle is...\n\nIt's a little buggy\n\nNeed some extra help?

I cleared the four words in the top half pretty quickly after I found BUTTERFLY (which admittedly took a few minutes to find). Then the spangram was next before I found the three at the bottom. A pretty easy one, I found!\n\nI used no hints and the spangram was the fifth theme word I found.\n\nSee you tomorrow for more Strands fun!\n\nPlease follow my blog for more coverage of Strands, Connections and other word games as well as video game news, insights and analysis.

I hope you\u2019re having a terrific week so far.\n\nSpending my time intentionally, or failing to do so as much as I\u2019d like, has been an issue for me for quite some time. It\u2019s something that\u2019s come more into focus for me recently after starting my newsletter which, (very) broadly speaking, is about how we spend our time.\n\nThe bulk of my time is mine to spend as I see fit and yet I am constantly frustrated with myself that so many evenings and weekends slip by into the ether. I look at the clock after I wrap up work for the day and suddenly two or three more hours have vanished. I don\u2019t necessarily need to spend my time productively, but it at least needs to be edifying.\n\nCountless hours of scrolling social media feeds on my phone certainly accounts for much of that lost time. In a moment of frustration this week, I deleted Instagram and logged out of other services I was using via a browser, namely X (which I only still keep an eye on for work), Facebook, Reddit and BlueSky. That\u2019s after turning off email notifications at night and disabling Gmail and Discord notifications on my smartwatch.\n\nPlay Puzzles & Games on Forbes\n\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes\u2122\n\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\n\nPinpoint By Linkedin\n\nGuess The Category\n\nQueens By Linkedin\n\nCrown Each Region\n\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\n\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\n\nThese are a small step that won\u2019t necessarily solve my problems. But as I open up the websites I\u2019ve logged out of, returning to them purely out of habit, I see that I\u2019m logged out. That\u2019s a useful reminder that I should do something more satisfying with my time.\n\nBefore we begin, we have a great little community on Discord, where we chat about NYT Connections, the rest of the NYT games and all kinds of other stuff. Everyone who has joined has been lovely. It\u2019s a fun hangout spot, and you\u2019re more than welcome to hang out with us.\n\nDiscord is also the best way to give me any feedback about the column, especially on the rare (or not-so-rare) occasions that I mess something up. I don\u2019t look at the comments or Twitter much. You can also read my weekend editions of this column at my new newsletter, Pastimes.\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Connections hints and answers for Thursday, May 29 are coming right up.\n\nHow To Play Connections\n\nConnections is a free, popular New York Times daily word game. You get a new puzzle at midnight every day. You can play on the NYT\u2019s website or Games app.\n\nYou\u2019re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.\n\nThere\u2019s only one solution for each puzzle, and you\u2019ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.\n\nEach group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.\n\nSelect four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you\u2019re incorrect, you\u2019ll lose a life. If you\u2019re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you\u2019re one word away from getting it right, but you\u2019ll still need to figure out which one to swap.\n\nIf you make four mistakes, it\u2019s game over. Let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you\u2019re really struggling, today\u2019s Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it\u2019s easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.\n\nIf you have an NYT All Access or Games subscription, you can access the publication\u2019s Connections archive. This includes every previous game of Connections, so you can go back and play any of those that you have missed.\n\nAside from the first 60 games or so, you should be able to find my hints via Google if you need them! Just click here and add the date of the game for which you need clues or the answers to the search query.\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Hints?\n\nScroll slowly!

Just one week away from the 100. Eek! Here's how I fared:\n\nThis was one of those days when I saw pretty much everything at once. APT was the entry point into the greens, while FROST and GLAZE made the blues pretty clear.\n\nI clocked the yellows right off the bat too. However, I slid through the purples first. That one wasn't difficult to figure out either, though I didn't immediately equate NUDE with buff. It took me a moment to remember that \"in the buff\" can mean \"nude.\"\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it for today\u2019s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog tomorrow for hints and the solution for Friday\u2019s game if you need them.\n\nP.S. I like mashups, pro wrestling and Taylor Swift, so this song was right up my alley. It also fits in with our ska punk theme week.\n\nI first came across this track about a decade ago. It blends the super catchy ska punk theme song of WWE wrestler Sami Zayn with \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" by Taylor Swift. This works remarkably well. In the back of my mind, I\u2019ve been thinking for years about getting a band (including a brass section) together to cover this. It's so much fun:\n\nHave a great day! Stay hydrated! Call someone you love!\n\nPlease follow my blog for more coverage of NYT Connections and other word games, and even some video game news, insights and analysis. It helps me out a lot!

It could have been solidified as the inevitable damages of climate change seemed more certain despite clear warnings from scientists. Perhaps this outlook was shaped by early experiences of the financial instability their families faced during the Great Recession.\n\nRegardless of the cause, it\u2019s evident that Generation Z often lacks trust in the significant institutions that past generations relied on for securing their futures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by AP-NORC in June 2024, only about 1 in 10 adults under 30 expressed \u201ca great deal of confidence\u201d in the leadership of the Supreme Court. Similarly, a May 2023 poll revealed that 44% of adults under 30 had \u201chardly any confidence at all\u201d in those managing banks and financial institutions. This rate is nearly double that of adults ages 60 and older who shared this sentiment.\n\nThe gap extends to other behaviors. An AP-NORC poll conducted in March found that only about one-quarter of adults under 30 volunteered their time to charity in the past year or provided non-financial support to people in their community, compared to 36% of those over 60. Younger adults were also more likely than older adults to say they or their household donated $0 to charity, according to the poll.\n\nThe philanthropic sector is working to reverse any disillusionment by empowering Gen Z to make the structural change they so often seek. Born out of the idea that young people distrust institutions because they don\u2019t feel served or included, several initiatives are underway with hopes that more responsive institutions will be seen as more legitimate ones. Perhaps the most optimistic believe their energy can bring alternatives to the status quo to life \u2014 if only given meaningful roles.\n\n\u201cYoung people \u2014 we\u2019re not just victims of these systems. We have agency and we have power,\u201d said Summer Dean, 27, who breaks down complex environmental topics into actionable information for the 116,000 followers of her Instagram, @climatediva.\n\n\u201cIf you want to inspire us, actually include us in solid structures of your organization,\u201d she added.\n\nDoSomething doesn\u2019t want to do just anything\n\nWhen DeNora Getachew became DoSomething CEO in April 2021 during the pandemic, she acknowledged the platform largely provided \u201cslacktivist\u201d opportunities \u2014 or low-effort ways to support social causes online. DoSomething was not meeting the desires of its 13- to 25-year-old audience for more lasting community change.\n\nThe nonprofit was founded in 1993 to boost youth volunteering. But Getachew said the \u201cnew DoSomething\u201d sees volunteerism as a \u201cstep on the ladder\u201d but not \u201cthe top rung.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a new program called Talking Trash that does more than just encourage volunteers to collect and recycle plastic bottles. Through educational campaigns and microgrants for select projects, DoSomething prompts members to think more deeply about improving their communities\u2019 overall waste management infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re their cheerleader,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re the person who has their back and are helping them figure out how they tap into that, at least initial, sense of curiosity about what they can do.\u201d\n\nKatelyn Knox, a 25-year-old former police officer, is part of the inaugural cohort of DoSomething \u201cbinfluencers\u201d who received $250 and peer support to improve local recycling systems. After moving from Florida to Los Angeles, Knox noticed many neighbors did not understand the guidelines for what is actually recyclable. Even if they did, she found that recycling bins were scarce.\n\nShe decided to design an app that identifies which recyclables go where and brings door-to-door recycling services to her community.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard to make change. You have to convince so many people to make this change \u2014 especially people who are older than you,\u201d Knox said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so scary knowing that other people are with me and doing it right next to me in their own cities.\u201d\n\nDoSomething brought together Knox and Dean to record a video educating college students about broken recycling systems. \n\nDean, the environmental storyteller, said she\u2019s seen many young folks respond to overwhelming structural issues in one of two ways: accepting that they\u2019ll \u201cjust have to learn to survive\u201d or \u201crealizing that we can just really imagine a new system of being and governing.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of us feel powerless at some point through all of this because there\u2019s many times where these systems make us feel like there is nothing we can do,\u201d she said. \u201cI always just tell people to hold onto these heavy emotions because that is what moves you to take action and not feel so much like a victim.\u201d\n\nOne Silicon Valley entrepreneur\u2019s $10 million call\n\nLinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman launched The Trust in American Institutions Challenge last December with philanthropic accelerator Lever for Change. The $10 million open call will scale local solutions to restore public confidence in anything from education and government to media and medicine.\n\nHoffman, a 57-year-old Democratic megadonor, finds that philanthropy offers more opportunities \u201cfor beginning the trust stuff.\u201d He said that\u2019s because there are no conflicting interests other than the mission.\n\nThe challenge is not focused solely on youth. Hoffman said that \u201cjust about everybody\u201d across the political spectrum can recognize society\u2019s trust issues. As he sees it, the problem isn\u2019t that institutions don\u2019t work for young people. They do work, according to Hoffman, and \u201cpart of being young is learning that.\u201d The idea, he added, \u201cis to reconnect and revivify.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like fish in water. We don\u2019t realize how important these institutions are to our ongoing environment,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cRevitalizing them is an important part of a society that works.\u201d\n\nA semiquincentennial opportunity\n\nAnother effort is connecting youth representatives with decision-makers to help civic institutions reach new generations ahead of the United States\u2019 250th anniversary.\n\nRecognizing that today\u2019s teens and young adults are the ones who will inherit American democracy, Youth250 is passing the microphone to young people as the country reflects on its past and looks ahead to its future. Advisors are working with museums, historic sites and libraries to center Gen Z\u2019s perspectives.\n\nDillon St. Bernard, the 25-year-old Youth250 documentary series director, said the campaign \u201cis about turning representation into power.\u201d \n\nHe emphasized the need to build intergenerational coalitions. Today\u2019s challenges \u2014 climate change, democracy and racial justice \u2014 haven\u2019t been solved by their predecessors, according to St. Bernard.\n\n\u201cWe as a generation have known nothing but a house on fire and want to see what it would look like to stop that spread,\u201d he said.\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

It\u2019s possible the attitude even formed from early memories of the financial insecurity brought upon their families by the Great Recession.\n\nWhatever the reason, it\u2019s well documented that Gen Z tends to lack trust in the major institutions that previous generations expected to safeguard their futures.\n\nAround 1 in 10 adults under 30 had \u201ca great deal of confidence\u201d in the people running the Supreme Court in an AP-NORC poll from June 2024. A May 2023 survey found 44% of adults under 30 had \u201chardly any confidence at all\u201d in those running banks and financial institutions \u2014 about twice the share of adults ages 60 and older, who felt the same way.\n\nThe gap extends to other behaviors. An AP-NORC poll conducted in March found that only about one-quarter of adults under 30 volunteered their time to charity in the past year or provided non-financial support to people in their community, compared to 36% of those over 60. Younger adults were also more likely than older adults to say they or their household donated $0 to charity, according to the poll.\n\nThe philanthropic sector is working to reverse any disillusionment by empowering Gen Z to make the structural change they so often seek. Born out of the idea that young people distrust institutions because they don\u2019t feel served or included, several initiatives are underway with hopes that more responsive institutions will be seen as more legitimate ones.

DoSomething was not meeting the desires of its 13- to 25-year-old audience for more lasting community change.\n\nThe nonprofit was founded in 1993 to boost youth volunteering. But Getachew said the \u201cnew DoSomething\u201d sees volunteerism as a \u201cstep on the ladder\u201d but not \u201cthe top rung.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a new program called Talking Trash that does more than just encourage volunteers to collect and recycle plastic bottles.

Hoffman said that \u201cjust about everybody\u201d across the political spectrum can recognize society\u2019s trust issues. As he sees it, the problem isn\u2019t that institutions don\u2019t work for young people.

The Sun sign represents will and purpose. Aries is the Cardinal Fire and rules the head. Your ruling planet is Mars. Aries tend to be headstrong, energetic, forceful, and outgoing. You are more likely to rush into things before proper planning and exhibit little patience when sitting back and letting events happen or mature without intervention. You have a strong will and can come across as self-centered when achieving your goals, big or small.\n\nThe Sun in the first house represents a collective of energy to be, act, and initiate. You are more likely to be enterprising and ambitious. Courageous, independent, and a natural leader, you forge ahead with your head held high and a determined look in your eye. Others may perceive you as egocentric or overbearing when you don\u2019t take other views into account. You are at your best when you demonstrate your independence, which does not hinder the independence of others.\n\nDaily Horoscope\n\nThe Sun transitioned solidly into the house of Gemini, so you may find yourself in full bloom along with nature. There is a sense of community and belonging with your surroundings. You may find yourself and others more willing to open themselves up to share ideas and small talk.\n\nThe Moon represents hidden or emotional needs, it reflects your instincts. While the Waxing Moon is in Gemini, you and those around you may thirst for intellectual conversation. You may notice the collective mood today is light and bright. It may be easier to become scatterbrained and not as receptive as usual. Practice active listening while conversing with others to help keep your head in the conversation. It is a good day to attack the emotionally volatile issues that you have been procrastinating about. Your mood and attitude will help dampen the situation so progress may be made without issue.\n\nLove and Relationships\n\nYou may need to boost security at home while Transiting Venus is in the Fourth House. You may feel it best to stay close to family and loved ones during this time, Aries. This transit will last three weeks, be sure to accomplish your security goals within this time frame. You may also isolate yourself from the world and nurture your inner child. Since you are more attuned to your emotions, you may be more sensitive to the emotions of those around you. This can be overstimulating and confusing if you are not accustomed to the feelings.\n\nFamily and Home\n\nWhile Transiting Mercury is Square Moon, you may experience conflicts at home, Aries. Parents and children may find themselves at odds over miscommunication or differences of opinion. You may have to adjust or change to deal with a minor crisis. Your attitude and self-expression will soften, and you will be able to express your feelings more effectively during this transition.\n\nCareer and Finances\n\nPlanetary energies are polarized as Pluto is Square Jupiter. Be aware, Aries, as outside influences stimulate your choices and perspective. Transforming your philosophy or feelings on spirituality may feel like a top priority. Aries, you are likely to delve into a new research project, whether for work or study, and you may find yourself fully immersed. Travel and educational plans are a valid possibility. Integration shall prove to be your only great challenge during this transit.\n\nFortify your mind and home for a sense of well-being and security. As an Aries, you take security and comfort quite seriously. It would be best to formulate a plan and move accordingly to give yourself peace of mind. You may find yourself feeling more influenced by those around you. Emotions seem to run amok and you may feel the need to isolate yourself. This is beneficial for short periods, as it allows you to come to terms with your emotions. Be sure to break your isolation with family or loved ones who have your best interests at heart.", "summary": "As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries tend to be trailblazers.

The two battled previously in the Big East during their college careers, with Siegrist being a former Villanova star, but now find themselves on the same side as WNBA teammates in Dallas. \n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely better playing with her than against her. She\u2019s such a great teammate. Not only is she a great basketball player, but she really makes her teammates better. I\u2019m happy to be able to play with her.\u201d\n\nBueckers said their shared Big East background and playing style have made the transition seamless, while highlighting how the chemistry-building process already is coming along well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to be here competing together instead of against each other this time,\u201d Bueckers said. \u201cJust being able to learn and grow and help each other out. I know she\u2019s helped me. We want to continue to lead from where we are\u2014even though we\u2019re younger players on the team\u2014but to have that same mindset. We come from great programs in the Big East, we sort of play the same, and have that mutual understanding on the court. So it\u2019s just been great to build that chemistry with her.\u201d\n\nPaige Bueckers: \u201cWe Looked Like a Team\u201d\n\nThe Wings put together their most efficient shooting performance of the season, hitting 56.1% from the field, 50% from deep, and 86.2% from the line. They also recorded season highs in assists (26), steals (10), and rebounding margin (+8).\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll remember the most probably the 26 assists on 37 made shots, and how we played together as a team,\u201d Bueckers said. \u201cHow unselfish we were, and how much we looked like a team. That reflected in the numbers.\u201d\n\nOn the defensive end, Teaira McCowan and Myisha Hines-Allen helped hold the Sun to 20% shooting in the fourth quarter. Hines-Allen also grabbed her 1,000th career rebound. McCowan, who finished with five points and five rebounds in roughly 16 minutes, has been an under-the-radar contributor off the bench lately, with a team-best +26 on the season. \n\n\u201cGreat defensive presence,\u201d Koclanes said of McCowan. \u201cShe cleans up the boards and clears space in the paint. I appreciate her consistency getting up and down the floor. She\u2019s getting more comfortable being on the perimeter, finding her way back to the block. Couldn\u2019t be happier with her approach and impact off the bench.\u201d\n\nTyasha Harris exited the game in the first half with a left knee injury and was later ruled out for the remainder of the night. Before tipoff, both Harris and Carrington received a tribute video on the jumbotron recognizing their past contributions to the Sun. Carrington was drafted by the Sun in 2021 and had a breakthrough season last year, earning the WNBA\u2019s Most Improved Player of the Year award.

The Trump administration claims the Tar Heel State is in violation of the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) after board officials provided a statewide voter registration form that did not make clear whether an applicant must provide a driver\u2019s license number, or if the applicant does not have a driver\u2019s license, the last four digits of the applicant\u2019s social security number. If an applicant has neither, the law says the state must assign a special identifying number. The lawsuit says, \"a significant number of North Carolina voters who did not provide a driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of a social security number using that voter registration form were nonetheless registered by their election officials, in violation of HAVA\" and the defendants \"only took limited actions to prevent further violations.\" FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS NC TO CERTIFY SUPREME COURT ELECTION RESULTS WITH DEMOCRAT LEADING \"Upon information and belief there currently are a significant number of voters that do not have a driver\u2019s license number, last four digits of a social security number, or any other identifying number, as required by Section 303 of HAVA, listed in North Carolina\u2019s state voter registration file,\" according to the filing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. \"Those violations will continue absent relief from this Court.\" \"Accurate voter registration rolls are critical to ensure that elections in North Carolina are conducted fairly, accurately, and without fraud,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice will not hesitate to file suit against jurisdictions that maintain inaccurate voter registration rolls in violation of federal voting laws.\" A previous edition of the state elections board, in which Democrats held a majority, acknowledged the problem in late 2023 after a voter complained. The board updated the voter registration form but declined to contact people who had registered to vote since 2004 in time for the 2024 elections so they could fill in the missing numbers. According to the lawsuit, the board indicated that such information would be accumulated on an ad hoc basis as voters appeared at polling places. It is unclear exactly how many voters' records still lack identifying numbers. Lawyers from the DOJ Civil Rights Division want a judge to give the state 30 days to develop a plan to contact voters with records that do not comply with federal law, obtain an identifying number for each and add that to the electronic list. The state and national GOP last year sued over the lack of identifying numbers, which they estimated could have affected 225,000 registrants. However, federal judges declined to make changes so close to the general election. The lawsuit also referred to President Donald Trump's executive order on elections in March to \"guard against illegal voting, unlawful discrimination, and other forms of fraud, error, or suspicion.\" FEDERAL JUDGE KICKS BATTLE OVER NC SUPREME COURT ELECTION BACK TO STATE COURT After Election Day, formal protests were filed by Jefferson Griffin, a Republican candidate for a seat on the state Supreme Court, who challenged about 65,500 ballots. He contended that about 60,000 were cast by registrants whose records failed to contain one of the two identifying numbers. The state election board said earlier this year at least roughly half of those voters actually did provide an identifying number. Griffin also challenged another 5,500 ballots belonging to overseas military personnel and their family members who were not required to attach a copy of their photo IDs, as well those in a category of \"Never Residents,\" or U.S. citizens with family ties to North Carolina who have never lived in the United States. A state appeals court criticized the board's handling of the registration records but ultimately ruled the challenged ballots had to remain in the final election tally. Six months passed during what amounted to be the nation\u2019s last contested 2024 election. Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs was ultimately certified as the winner over Griffin by 734 votes out of over 5.5 million ballots cast. Griffin conceded earlier this month but said he did not fully agree with the court\u2019s analysis. This month, the state election board\u2019s composition changed to reflect a 2024 law approved by the GOP-dominated General Assembly that shifted the board\u2019s appointment powers from the now-Democratic governor to Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek. A previous 3-2 Democratic majority is now a 3-2 Republican majority. The new iteration of the board sounds open to embracing the Justice Department\u2019s wishes.

Since the show, many people online have pointed out that Black musicians pioneered the genre and, despite being all-too-frequently excluded from history, influenced several of country\u2019s earliest superstars \u2014 though some of that discussion has manifested in vitriolic comments on the \u201cAm I Okay?\u201d artist\u2019s profile. \n\n But in his reply on Moroney\u2019s post, Shaboozey clarified that his reaction \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d his partner on the AMAs stage. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but respect for her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some hateful comments directed at her today, and that\u2019s not what this moment was about.\u201d \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s not twist the message,\u201d added the Virginia native. \u201cShe is amazing and someone who represents the country community in the highest light!\u201d\n\n Both \u2018Boozey and Moroney had big years in 2024, with the former tying Lil Nas X\u2019s record for longest-running No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 after \u201cA Bar Song\u201d clocked its 19th week in the top spot, and the latter earning her first-ever top 10 album on the Billboard 200 with Am I Okay? reaching No. 9 on the chart.

Deficit?\n\nThe \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d is expected to add around $3.3 trillion to the federal debt over the next 10 years, according to an estimate published by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The fiscal watchdog group warned this number could rise by an additional $5.2 trillion if lawmakers \u201cultimately extend temporary provisions.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s comments criticizing Trump\u2019s signature policy agenda come at a time when the billionaire has taken a step back from leading DOGE. While addressing the Qatar Economic Forum last week, Musk said he plans to cut back his political donations significantly. Musk said he is \u201cgoing to do a lot less in the future,\u201d and when asked why, the billionaire responded, \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d The Tesla CEO spent more than $200 million to back Trump in the presidential election last year and quickly emerged as an influential figure in the president\u2019s orbit after he took office. However, Musk\u2019s heavy spending appeared to backfire in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race last month, as the liberal candidate Susan Crawford managed to beat her conservative rival convincingly\u2014 a result that some saw as a referendum on Musk. Last month, Musk told Tesla investors that his work with DOGE would \u201cdrop significantly\" starting in May, and he would dedicate more of his time to running the carmaker.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d narrowly cleared a House vote last week after Trump personally stepped in and warned the GOP\u2019s conservative fiscal hawks against tanking his signature agenda. The bill eventually passed with a narrow margin of 215-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. The president hailed the House\u2019s passage of the bill, saying it was \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed,\u201d in a Truth Social post.

The lawsuit claims that Hunt negotiated a mandatory intimacy coordinator for all nude or intimate scenes. (SAG-AFTRA also requires intimate scenes to follow regulations that include consent and a closed set.)\n\n LaBella claims that all went well through a scripted rape scene that was detailed and rehearsed with an intimacy coordinator and stunt coordinator. However, the following day, on May 2, 2023, the lawsuit alleges that those rules were not followed when Costner asked LaBella to stand in for Hunt in an unplanned scene of sexual violence involving a different character, played by Roger Ivens. (Hunt had allegedly refused to perform the scene.)\n\n \u201cMr. Ivens violently rustled Ms. LaBella\u2019s skirt up as if trying to penetrate her against her will,\u201d the lawsuit states, alleging that the scene had not been rehearsed, no intimacy coordinator was present, and the actions were visible to the crew.\n\n Costner\u2019s attorney contested the allegation. \u201cAs a stunt performer on Horizon 2, the scene in question was explained to Ms. LaBella, and after she performed the rehearsal in character with another actor, she gave her Stunt Coordinator supervisor a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 and indicated her willingness to then shoot the scene, if needed (which she was not),\u201d Singer wrote.\n\n In her suit, LaBella claims she was \u201cterrified\u201d after the experience and raised concerns to stunt coordinators and the film\u2019s intimacy coordinator. She also alleged that her career came to an \u201cabrupt halt\u201d after the situation, leaving her feeling \u201cworthless.\u201d However, Singer claimed that \u201cshe was in good spirits and made no complaints\u201d to the stunt coordinators involved with the movie, including during a dinner the night of the alleged incident.\n\n LaBella and her attorneys are requesting that a jury decide whether punitive damages are warranted. According to the complaint, the lawsuit aims not only to seek compensation but also to \u201caddress the continued failures at the highest levels of Hollywood production companies to comprehend and address the impacts of performing in sexually explicit and violent \u2018scenes\u2019 and the need for intimacy coordination.\u201d", "summary": "\"I was left exposed, unprotected, and deeply betrayed by a system that promised safety and professionalism,\u201d claimed Devyn LaBella", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/kevin-costner-sued-stunt-performer-unscripted-rape-scene-1235349148/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kevin-costner.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 01:10:51", "author": "Tom\u00e1s Mier", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Mier"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.086}]}, {"news": [{"id": 325791058, "title": "Pokemon Legends: Z-A just got an October release date, and we can look forward to another Pokemon Presents stream in July", "text": "Skip to main content\n\nGamesRadar+\n\nGamesRadar+\n\nGamesRadar+ The Games, Movies, TV & Comics You Love\n\nSearch GamesRadar+\n\nView Profile\n\nXbox Series X\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nNintendo Switch 2\n\nTabletop Gaming\n\nToys & Collectibles\n\nRetro Gamer\n\nNewsletters\n\nTotal Film \n\nGaming Magazines\n\nWhy subscribe?\n\nSubscribe from just \u00a33\nTakes you closer to the games, movies and TV you love\nTry a single issue or save on a subscription\nIssues delivered straight to your door or device\n\n From\u00a39.99View\n\nSummer Game Fest schedule 2025\n\nNew games 2025\nUpcoming Switch 2 games\n\nRecommended reading\n\nPokemon Legends Z-A: Everything we know so far\n\nPokemon Legends Z-A launches \"late 2025\" on Switch, and Mega Evolutions are returning for the first time in 7 years\n\nAfter wondering what the heck Pokemon Legends: Z-A's name actually meant, we now know it's tied to a pretty cool ranking system\n\nEverything announced at Pokemon Presents 2025\n\nPokemon Legends: Z-A looks to finally bring my anime-inspired dreams of truly active combat to life\n\nPokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolution \u2013 All the Pokemon who can Mega-Evolve we know about so far\n\nAdventure Games\nPokemon is a stealth game now: Pokemon Legends Z-A wants you to sneak attack trainers during its nighttime battle royale\n\nAdventure Games\n\nPokemon Legends: Z-A\n\nPokemon Legends: Z-A just got an October release date, and we can look forward to another Pokemon Presents stream in July\n\nCatherine Lewis \n\n28 May 2025\n\nThe new Kalos adventure arrives on October 16\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Following a resounding victory for the Indiana Pacers, the All-Star guard had a lot to say about his team's effort and the fight still left to come.\n\n\"I felt like I let the team down in Game 3, so it was important for me to come out here and just make plays. The guys put me in a position to make plays, and I'm just trying to play my game,\" said Haliburton. \"It's a big win for us.\"\n\nJohn Haliburton made his return to the Fieldhouse tonight after a short-lived suspension. He had been suspended over an incident with Giannis Antetokounmpo, but he was back in action tonight, and it was enough to fuel one of the best games of Tyrese Haliburton's young career.\n\n\"I'm glad my Pops was in the building, it makes it that much sweeter. It had a little bit to do with it,\" said Hali after the win.\n\nFortunately, unlike in Game 3, when the Pacers gave up a double-digit lead to lose down the stretch, John got to watch his son's team extend their series lead to 3-1 over the most popular team in the NBA. If they win Game 5 on Thursday, the Pacers will make their first Finals appearance since 2000.\n\n\"I'm excited about it. It's gonna be a lot of fun, it's a tight environment to play in,\" said Haliburton. \"We gotta be ready. It's one more game. Take what we can from this and get better at what we lacked tonight and be ready to go in Game 5.\"\n\nAfter a lackluster effort on Sunday, Haliburton did everything he could to make things right. He led the Pacers to a 43-point first quarter, taking an early lead that they carried for the entire game. The young superstar made history as the first player to drop 30 points, 12 rebounds, and 15 assists with no turnovers in a playoff game.\n\nIt's no surprise that the Pacers controlled the pace for most of the game, and they had the Knicks completely hopeless looking for answers. As the fourth seed in the playoffs, nobody expected them to survive this far into the bracket, but they are doing more than that.\n\nWith Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, Myles Turner, and Bennedict Mathurin, the Pacers have found an elite roster, and head coach Rick Carlisle has found a way to bring out the best in all the players. For the second straight year, they're in the East Finals, and now they are just one win away from the NBA Finals.\n\nStill, until they secure that final victory, the Pacers cannot take it easy. Back in Madison Square Garden for Game 5, New York will have the energy from their fans to help power them to a win and extend the series. To get the job done early, the Pacers must deliver perfect execution while Tyrese Haliburton fulfills his role as their leader both on and off the court.\n\nEven if/when they take care of business against the Knicks, Indiana will have to face steep competition in the Finals, either against the Thunder or the Minnesota Timberwolves.", "summary": "Tyrese Haliburton was all smiles tonight as he looked into the crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.

I am ready for any format,\" Zelensky said in comments to journalists on Tuesday that were published on Wednesday.The Ukrainian leader said he was \"ready\" for a \"Trump-Putin-me\" meeting, and also urged Washington to hit Moscow with a package of hard-hitting sanctions on its banking and energy sectors.\"We are waiting for sanctions from the United States of America,\" Zelensky said.\"Trump confirmed that if Russia does not stop, sanctions will be imposed. We discussed two main aspects with him -- energy and the banking system. Will the US be able to impose sanctions on these two sectors? I would very much like that.\"The Ukrainian leader had previously appeared to express frustration at Washington for not having announced fresh sanctions on Moscow after Russia rejected a coordinated Western appeal for an immediate ceasefire.Trump over the weekend called Putin \"crazy\" after a massive Russian barrage killed at least 13 people across Ukraine.And on Tuesday, he went on blasting at the Russian leader.\"What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He's playing with fire!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social network.Despite months of US-led diplomacy, the two sides appear no closer to striking a deal to end the three-year-long war, triggered by Russia's February 2022 invasion.Tens of thousands have been killed, much of east and southern Ukraine has been destroyed, and Moscow's army now controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.Hours after Zelensky spoke, Ukraine unleashed one of its largest ever drone barrages on Russia, where officials reported only minimal damage from the attacks.Moscow's three major international airports were forced to suspend flights for hours overnight amid the barrage, aviation authorities said.Ukraine said that Russia launched more than 900 drones in the three days up to Monday. Thirteen civilians were killed in attacks on Sunday, including three children.On the battlefield, Zelensky said Russia was \"amassing\" more than 50,000 troops on the front line around the northeastern Sumy border region, where Moscow's army has captured a number of settlements as it seeks to establish what Putin has called a \"buffer zone\" inside Ukrainian territory.Zelensky also said that Ukraine is yet to receive a promised \"memorandum\" from Russia on its demands for a peace deal.Ukraine has accused Russia of dragging out the peace process following the first direct talks in more than three years between negotiators from the two sides earlier this month in Istanbul.Zelensky is due to visit Germany on Wednesday for talks with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has pledged muscular backing for Kyiv in its fight against Russia.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that details on a second round of negotiations would be announced soon.", "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a three-way summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin as he seeks to force Moscow to halt its three-year-long invasion.", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/zelensky-proposes-three-way-meeting-trump-putin-3774684", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4603221/us-president-donald-trump-c-has-expressed-frustration-both-russias-vladmir-putin-r-ukrainian.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 08:06:09", "author": "Victoria Lukovenko", "authors": ["Victoria Lukovenko"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.381}, {"id": 325795834, "title": "Zelensky Calls For Three-Way Talks With Trump and Putin, Calls For New Sanctions if Russia Refuses Peace", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky called for trilateral leaders\u2019 talks between himself, the U.S., and Russia, while Moscow said that the next round of \u201cdirect talks\u201d will be announced soon.\n\nWeeks after the first in-person talks between Russia and Ukraine ended in apparent failure, with no progress towards peace or even a ceasefire beyond an agreement for a prisoner exchange, fresh talks appear to be again on the horizon.

Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced the removal of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization schedule for \"healthy children and pregnant women\" -- a move that could alter guidance for doctors as well as some insurance coverage.\n\nKennedy, one of the nation's most publicly recognized vaccine skeptics, made the announcement in a video post on his X account, where he stood between Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya -- both of whom are doctors.\n\n\"We're now one step closer to realizing President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again,\" Kennedy said in the video.\n\nWhile the text posted alongside the video noted HHS had taken action Tuesday, the official immunization schedule on the CDC website had not changed as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe CDC's immunization schedule is not only a guide for doctors -- it also determines insurance coverage for most major private plans and Medicaid expansion programs.\n\nIt remains unclear what federal health officials consider \"healthy\" children or pregnant women.\n\nPregnancy is listed by the CDC as an underlying condition, so women expecting a child would theoretically be eligible for the shot even under the new FDA vaccine framework released last week.\n\nLast week, the FDA announced that it planned to limit access to future COVID-19 shots only to people over 65 years old or those with an underlying health condition.\n\nABC News has asked HHS for clarity on Tuesday's announcement.\n\nMedical leader 'kind of blindsided by this announcement'\n\nKennedy's announcement cut out a process where the CDC's independent panel of advisors vote for any new or updated recommendations to the immunization schedule. The panel has been expected to vote on the matter in their June meeting. In mid-April, the panel had discussed, and seemed to support, a recommendation that everyone over 6 months should receive an annual COVID vaccine or shift to a model where only those who were high-risk would be eligible.\n\nTypically, the CDC director green-lights new vaccine recommendations, but with the active director role empty while Susan Monarez awaits confirmation for the CDC's top job, Kennedy announced the new recommendations. Kennedy recently made changes to vaccine recommendations for those traveling abroad to an area with elevated risk of infections with the agency noting, \"With pending confirmation of a new CDC Director, these recommendations were adopted by the HHS Secretary on May 13, 2025 and are now official recommendations of the CDC.\"\n\nA leader of a medical group that is typically involved in the process for changes to the immunization schedule noted he was \"kind of blindsided by this announcement.\"\n\n\"We were not consulted about this,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases, told ABC News, referring to the removal of the COVID-19 vaccine from the recommended immunization schedule for children.\n\n\"My biggest concern is about the process. This really ignores a long-established, evidence-based process that has been used to make vaccine recommendations in the U.S. It ignores the opinions of the medical experts who help make these recommendations, and it also ignores all of the liaison organizations that work with the [CDC's advisory panel] to craft these recommendations,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America said the decision will have a negative impact.\n\n\"Many health insurers rely on federal recommendations to determine coverage, and this decision could make it significantly harder for millions of Americans to access vaccines they want for themselves and their families,\" the society said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it is \"concerned about and extremely disappointed by the announcement.\"\n\n\"\"Following this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit. We are concerned about access implications and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy,\" the group said in a statement on Tuesday. \"And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future.\"\n\nThe number of children who have received the updated COVID vaccine annually has been limited since peak pandemic. An estimated 13% of kids received the most recent COVID vaccine, the latest CDC data from late April shows. At the same time last year, the rate was 14.2%.\n\nThe rate of COVID vaccination among pregnant women has also remained lower with 14.4% receiving the most recent COVID vaccine, the latest CDC data from late April shows. At the same time last year, the rate was 12.3%.\n\nKennedy's previous comments on COVID-19 vaccine, childhood vaccine schedule\n\nKennedy has frequently shared views on vaccines -- including the COVID-19 vaccine -- that are at odds with the consensus of public health researchers and the mainstream scientific community.\n\nIn May 2021, Kennedy asked the federal government to revoke its authorization of all COVID-19 vaccines; in December 2021 he falsely claimed that the COVID-19 vaccine was \"the deadliest vaccine ever made.\"\n\nKennedy's announcement comes weeks after he promised senators that he supported the childhood vaccination schedule during his confirmation testimony with the Senate Finance Committee in late January.\n\n\"I support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\" Kennedy said at the time.\n\n\"If confirmed, I will do nothing as HHS Secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines,\" he repeatedly told the committee following questions from senators after his testimony.\n\nKennedy has previously advocated against the recommended vaccine schedule for children.\n\nHe has fought for changes through the Children's Health Defense, a group he founded but resigned as chairman and legal counsel of to become HHS Secretary. Last week, he released his \"Make America Healthy Again\" report, which included calls for increased scrutiny of the childhood vaccine schedule.\n\nAlthough the report states that vaccines protect children from infectious diseases, it also claims parents are concerned about their \"appropriate use\" and their \"possible role\" in chronic diseases among children.\n\n\"Despite the growth of the childhood vaccine schedule, there has been limited scientific inquiry into the links between vaccines and chronic disease, the impacts of vaccine injury, and conflicts of interest in the development of the vaccine schedule. These areas warrant future inquiry,\" the report states.\n\nDozens of studies have failed to find a link between an increased number of vaccines and more chronic disease among children.\n\nEarlier this month, Kennedy said during a House hearing that his \"opinions about vaccines are irrelevant,\" later adding \"I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me.\"", "summary": "The move could alter guidance for doctors as well as some insurance coverage.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rfk-jr-cuts-covid-vaccine-recommendation-healthy-kids/story?id=122233770", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d2f824f1-0a3c-4907-b025-84c12d715832/kennedy-hhs-ht-jef-250527_1748367275194_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 10:20:43", "author": "Youri Benadjaoud", "authors": ["Youri Benadjaoud"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.091}, {"id": 325856918, "title": "RFK Jr. scraps Covid shots for pregnant women, kids", "text": "SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nRFK Jr. scraps Covid shots for pregnant women, kids\n\nThe Health Secretary announced a policy change without informing CDC officials\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nPregnant women are 'at high risk of severe illness and complications from Covid'\n\n(Image credit: Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images)\n\nRafi Schwartz, The Week US \n\n28 May 2025\n\nWhat happened\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Children previously vaccinated or exposed to Covid tend to have milder infections, but Kennedy \"seems to have reneged on a promise\" to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) \"not to alter the childhood immunization schedule.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stop recommending COVID-19 shots for healthy children and pregnant women, calling it \u201cshortsighted\u201d and warning it could limit health care choices for families.\n\nDr. Corinne Kohler, a family practice physician and president-elect of the Illinois Academy of Family Physicians, noted that the vaccine is not only intended to prevent severe illness but also to stop spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cOne of the other impacts in not immunizing, especially children, is that they are such a vector for viral diseases,\u201d Kohler said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re not immunized, and even if they have mild or asymptomatic illness, they are still spreading it, especially to our vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cI think it is very shortsighted to limit the vaccine coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nKennedy announced the shift in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions to Kennedy and HHS. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming HHS secretary, claimed annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids \u201cdespite the lack of any clinical data\u201d to support that decision.\n\nU.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, had previously urged annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The CDC website cites data showing vaccination reduces risk of severe illness and says it\u2019s important to stay up to date with boosters because protection decreases over time.\n\nStill, changing the recommendations is not completely out of the blue. As the pandemic has waned, experts have increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older, who are among those most at risk for death and hospitalization.\n\nA CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. One of its options is suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. Kennedy opted not to wait for the CDC\u2019s recommendations.\n\nVaccination has been recommended for pregnant women, in part, because it\u2019s a way to pass immunity to newborns who are too young for vaccines and are vulnerable to infections. According to the CDC, from October 2022 to April 2024, young infants were more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 than any age group other than those 75 and older.\n\nFor pregnant women, COVID-19 can also increase the risk of high blood pressure and preterm birth, Kohler said.\n\nThose looking to protect themselves and their families with a vaccine may have more hurdles to overcome after Kennedy\u2019s decision, Kohler said, as insurance companies could decide to stop covering the shot, limiting availability.\n\n\u201cThat is going to possibly impact vaccine availability in terms of what is covered,\u201d she said.\n\nThat concern was shared by Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the committee on infectious diseases for the Itasca-based American Academy of Pediatrics. In a statement, he said the CDC could be stripping families of choice.\n\n\u201cThose who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage remain unclear,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s also unclear whether health care workers would be eligible to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision bypasses a \u201clong established, evidence-based process\u201d to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of medical experts. \u201cWhat is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,\u201d he said.\n\nBetween October 2024 and March, children and teenagers accounted for about 4% of hospitalizations related to COVID-19, according to the CDC. Pediatric deaths are rare, but children haven\u2019t been spared. The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths in the U.S. since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.\n\nIn 2023, an Oxford University study found that between 2021 and 2022, COVID-19 was a leading cause of death among those 19 and under in the U.S., ranking eighth overall. It ranked first in deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases.\n\nResearchers said the study suggests public health measures like vaccinations and staying at home when sick still have an important role to play in limiting transmission of the virus.\n\nDespite Kennedy\u2019s announcement, Kohler said she will still encourage people to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine still helps prevent serious illness, hospitalization and deaths, especially in our vulnerable populations,\u201d she said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2025/05/28/illinois-doctors-sound-alarm-about-dropping-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation-for-kids-and-pregnant-women", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b1b618/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3836+0+322/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F4e%2Fe40cfa444fc2a3054e4ac35eb42d%2F2021", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 19:33:06", "author": "Emmanuel Camarillo", "authors": ["Emmanuel Camarillo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.074}]}, {"news": [{"id": 325792758, "title": "Apple\u2019s Self Service Repair program now extends to iPad", "text": "Apple\u2019s increasingly comprehensive Self Service Repair program now includes iPad too.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump praised Bove as \"SMART, TOUGH, and respected by everyone.\" \"He will end the Weaponization of Justice, restore the Rule of Law, and do anything else that is necessary to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\" Trump added. TRUMP CONSIDERS FORMER DEFENSE ATTORNEY EMIL BOVE FOR FEDERAL APPEALS COURT VACANCY U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also praised his nomination on X. Emil has been \"indispensable partner at the Department of Justice\" she said, and \"has worked tirelessly from day one as we make America safe again.\" \"It is hard to imagine going to work without Emil, but our loss here at DOJ will be the country\u2019s gain!\" she added. There are two vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. If confirmed, Bove he would serve a lifetime appointment on the federal bench. Bove faces an uncertain path to confirmation, as Democrats have sharply criticized President Trump\u2019s efforts to install loyalists atop the DOJ and FBI. His nomination is likely to spark a contentious confirmation battle, with Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats expected to use the process to press Bove on some of the administration\u2019s most controversial actions. News of his nomination comes weeks after Trump installed Ed Martin, his controversial former nominee to serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, to serve as the Justice Department's pardon attorney. The role gives Martin broad oversight, including leadership of the so-called \"weaponization working group\" within the Justice Department formed under Trump. TRUMP'S REMARKS COULD COME BACK TO BITE HIM IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION BATTLE Prior to his installation at the Justice Department, Bove spent nearly 10 years as a U.S. prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. He also defended Trump in two of his criminal trials following his first term in the White House. In each of these roles and at DOJ, Bove's hard-charging tactics have solidified his reputation as a fierce, loyal and, at times, aggressive leader. He has emerged as the man behind some of the Justice Department's most contentious actions during Trump's second term, prompting some officials to resign rather than carry out his marching orders. Shortly after taking office, Bove sent a memo threatening state and city officials with criminal charges or civil penalties if they failed to comply with the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration or slow-walked their orders on enforcement. It was also Bove who ordered federal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York to file a motion to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. That order prompted a string of resignations from personnel, including acting U.S attorney for the section Danielle Sassoon, who chose to leave DOJ rather than drop the case. 'BOLD AND FEARLESS': TRUMP LAUNCHES NEW WAVE OF JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Fox News also reported earlier this year that Bove was behind an exhaustive questionnaire sent to FBI agents detailing their roles in the Jan. 6 investigations. Questions ranged from agents' participation in any grand jury subpoenas to whether the agents worked or responded to leads from another FBI field office or if they worked as a case agent for investigations. Former Justice Department officials have cited concerns that the probe or any retaliatory measures carried out as a result could have a chilling effect on the work of the FBI, including its more than 52 separate field offices.

In a complaint filed Tuesday in the Superior Court of California for Los Angeles County and obtained by Fox News Digital, LaBella sued Costner and his production companies for sexual harassment, sexual discrimination, the creation of a hostile workplace environment and retaliation stemming from an alleged on-set incident in May 2023. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Costner's attorney, Marty Singer, emphatically denied the allegations made against his client, saying that LaBella's claim \"has absolutely no merit.\" The lawsuit claimed that, \"On May 2, 2023, plaintiff Devyn LaBella, a female stunt performer, was the victim of a violent unscripted, unscheduled rape scene directed by Kevin Costner.\" \u2018HORIZON\u2019 DIRECTOR KEVIN COSTNER GRATEFUL \u2018GOD ALLOWED\u2019 HIM TO MAKE EPIC MOVIE DESPITE MASSIVE PERSONAL RISKS \"The impact of this impromptu work demand on Ms. Labella has been profound, not only upending a career Ms. Labella spent years building but leaving her with permanent trauma that she will be required to address for years to come,\" the documents added. LaBella is suing for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and she has requested a trial by jury. According to the lawsuit, stunt coordinator Wade Allen hired LaBella on a SAG-AFTRA contract to work as Hunt's stunt double during the filming of \"Horizon 2,\" which took place in Utah. Under SAG-AFTRA protocols, any scenes involving nudity or simulated sex require 48 hours prior notice, consent and a closed set along with the right for the performer to bring an intimacy coordinator. The lawsuit stated that Hunt's \"Horizon 2\" contract stipulated that the presence of an intimacy coordinator was mandatory for all scenes involving nudity or simulated sex, a requirement that was also extended to anyone acting as the actress' stand-in, including LaBella. Per the lawsuit, LaBella began filming \"Horizon 2\" in April 2023. \"For the first several weeks, Ms. LaBella professionally performed her stunts without incident,\" the documents read. \"However, this experience changed dramatically. Due to its very physical nature, Defendants informed Ms. LaBella she would be doubling for the majority of a scripted, aggressive and intimate rape scene\" between Juliette and a male actor's character. According to the documents, the scene was filmed on May 1, 2023, and LaBella and the actors previously rehearsed it with Wade and an intimacy coordinator. During the filming of the scene, the set was closed, and the intimacy coordinator was present. \"The scene \u2018wrapped,\u2019 and no issues were noted,\" the lawsuit stated. Per the documents, LaBella was on set to film a \"non-intimate scene\" the following day. The lawsuit alleged that Costner, who was present on the set, improvised additional scenes in which Juliette would be raped by a different character played by another actor. KEVIN COSTNER BRINGS HIS NEW 'LOVE' TO \u2018HORIZON' SET AS PRODUCTION ON THIRD WESTERN IS UNDERWAY The new scenes required the actor to \"climb on top of Ms. Hunt, violently raking up her skirt,\" the documents claimed. \"Due to the ad hoc and violent nature of the sudden script change request, along with the failure to secure a contractually required intimacy coordinator for the scene, Ms. Hunt became visibly upset and walked off the set, refusing to do the scene,\" the documents alleged. LaBella claimed that Costner asked her to serve as a \"stand-in\" for Hunt after the actress's departure. She alleged that Costner directed the other actor to \"repeatedly perform a violent simulated rape\" on her \"without proper notice, consent, preparation, or appropriate safeguard measures in place, such as the project\u2019s intimacy coordinator being called in.\" According to the lawsuit, LaBella was unaware that Hunt had left the set after allegedly refusing to perform the scene. In addition, LaBella alleged that the set was not closed. \"Unlike the shots from the previous day, which were limited to just the actors involved engaging in a choreographed situation with a stunt coordinator, an intimacy coordinator and some of lead production personnel present and all nonessential production people excluded, on May 2, the entire experience was broadcast over monitors,\" the lawsuit claimed. \"Further increasing confusion and stress for Ms. LaBella, the scene on May 2nd had no clear direction of when the scene began or ended. Defendant Costner failed to announce or to consistently announce \"action\" at the beginning or \"cut\" at the end of a shoot,\" the documents stated. \"After the action had already begun, there was no time or space to process or reject the direction that was given.\" LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

After the filming of the scene was completed, LaBella \"experienced shock, embarrassment and humiliation while attempting to process the situation.\" LaBella said she experienced \"sudden bouts of crying on and off set\" for the next few days and \"broke down in the hair trailer\" at one point. According to the documents, LaBella flew home for several days to spend time with family before returning to the set. \"However, the situation on the set upon her return was very awkward,\" the documents claimed. \"The production team was now extra careful around Ms. LaBella. She was directed to stay alone in her trailer and not be present on set, even though this resulted in her being dressed in costume for full days and then not used.\" \"Multiple people apologized to her over the course of days and made excuses for Director Costner, all of which made her feel even more uncomfortable,\" the lawsuit added. After production wrapped, LaBella claimed that she began therapy in June 2023 to \"address symptoms\" of the alleged experience, which included \"intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event, sleep disturbance, fears of intimacy, and anxiety.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER \"On that day, I was left exposed, unprotected, and deeply betrayed by a system that promised safety and professionalism,\" LaBella said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"What happened to me shattered my trust and forever changed how I move through this industry,\" she continued. \"As I continue performing and step into my journey of stunt coordination, I operate with a fierce commitment to upholding the highest standards, creating sets where safety, communication, and consent are non-negotiable.\" \"This experience has ignited in me a lifelong mission to be the advocate I once needed, ensuring no one else is ever left as vulnerable as I was.\" In a statement, Singer told Fox News Digital, \"Our client, Kevin Costner, always wants to make sure that everyone is comfortable working on his films and takes safety on set very seriously. However, this claim by Devyn LaBella has absolutely no merit, and it is completely contradicted by her own actions \u2013 and the facts.\" Singer labeled LaBella \"a serial accuser of people in the entertainment industry,\" adding, \"But those shakedown tactics won\u2019t work in this case. \"As a stunt performer on \u2018Horizon 2,\u2019 the scene in question was explained to Ms. LaBella, and after she performed the rehearsal in character with another actor, she gave her Stunt Coordinator supervisor [Allen] a \"thumbs up\" and indicated her willingness to then shoot the scene, if needed (which she was not),\" Singer stated.

This extends to LaBella, who is a third-party beneficiary of this stipulation as her stunt double.According to LaBella's suit, SAG-AFTRA contracts also prohibit the introduction of a last-minute intimacy scene, giving actors at least 48 hours to negotiate the scene. And, intimacy scenes must be performed on a closed set.LaBella's suit, which was filed in the LA County court of the Superior Court of California, states that she had performed one scripted rape scene for the film which was done in accordance with all SAG-AFTRA protocols, including a closed set and an intimacy coordinator.However, she then alleges that a second, unscripted rape scene, occurred on May 2 when she was on set to film for a non-intimate scene.According to LaBella's suit, \"Ms. Hunt arrived for her shot as scheduled on May 2. The script only called for Juliette (Ms. Hunt) to mouth the word \"No.\" However, when Ms. Hunt arrived, she learned that the Director, Defendant Costner, had requested that additional scenes be shot with a different male actor, Mr. Ivens, who had also been cast during pre-production in the Los Angeles area.\"In these new scenes, Mr. Ivens was to climb on top of Ms. Hunt, violently raking up her skirt. Defendant Costner, who was present on the set, specifically added this scene, which varied from the scene filmed the day before which had not involved pulling up the actor's skirt. Moreover, this revised scene is not specified in the assigned call sheet for that day,\" the suit says.According to her court filings, LaBella was \"completely unaware of these developments,\" and was caught entirely by surprise when her stand-in role suddenly turned into a simulated rape scene, with her being allegedly pinned down by a male actor performing the scene with her.She says she was not given the requisite 48 hours to sign off on the scene, the set was not closed, and there was no intimacy coordinator present. Her suit is against Costner as she has accused him of directing the action.Costner's attorney, Singer, told Deadline: \"Our client Kevin Costner always wants to make sure that everyone is comfortable working on his films and takes safety on set very seriously. However, this claim by Devyn LaBella has absolutely no merit, and it is completely contradicted by her own actions \u2013 and the facts.\"Singer said that LaBella was made aware of the scene prior to filming, and that the night following the scene, she was in good spirits and did not bring any complaints to the stunt coordinator. Singer has accused LaBella of making similar claims against other sets.What People Are SayingDevyn LaBella's lawsuit alleges: \"As a proximate result of Defendants' conduct, Ms. LaBella suffered and continues to suffer damages in terms of lost wages, lost bonuses, lost benefits, and other pecuniary loss according to proof. Ms. LaBella has also suffered and will continue to suffer physical and emotional injuries, including nervousness, humiliation, depression, anguish, embarrassment, fright, shock, pain, discomfort, fatigue, and anxiety. The amount of Plaintiff's damages will be ascertained at trial.\"Kevin Costner's lawyer, Marty Singer, told Deadline: \"The facts are clear and we are beyond confident that Kevin will prevail.\"What Happens NextLaBella is suing for relief due to her alleged trauma and loss of wages from losing other work following the alleged incident, for a public apology, and for the defendants to submit to anti-sexual harassment and anti-sexual violence training provided by a reputable organization such as RAINN.

Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns \u2b1b\ufe0f, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. \ud83d\udfe8 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. \ud83d\udfe9 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.\nYour second go should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above.\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.\n\nKerry Brunskill\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nContributing Writer\n\nWhen baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

His breakthrough role proved to be a history-making one too, securing the part of David, aka Tsotsi, in Gavin Hood\u2019s searing 2005 crime drama Tsotsi. In the film, set in a Johannesburg township, Chweneyagae plays a small-time hoodlum who steals a car only to discover a baby in the back seat that causes him to change his ways. \n\n Tsotsi was a huge hit with critics, with praise especially for Chweneyagae\u2019s performance. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for best foreign language film, winning the latter and becoming the first South African film to win an Oscar. The success of Tsotsi secured Chweneyagae place as one of the best known South African actors. \n\n As well as features, Chweneyagae\u2019s found great success on domestic television, and was arguably better known in South Africa for his leading role in the popular telenovela The River.

Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.\n\nAccusations of inaction\n\nDuring the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.\n\nAt the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.\n\n\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.\n\n\u201cMore could have been done,\u201d Kellenberger said. \u201cThings could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\u201d\n\nLe Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.\n\nLe Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time.

Judges followed the public prosecutor\u2019s recommendations regarding the length of the sentence and the criminal court of Morbihan, in western France, ordered that Le Scouarnec should serve at least two-thirds of the sentence before he can be eligible for release. Le Scouarnec is already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces. In French law, sentences run concurrently and Le Scouarnec should only serve the additional years after the first sentence is completed.

Yet in six years, he could potentially be released. It\u2019s staggering.\u201d The new trial began in February and laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls. Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents. During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures. At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017. \u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments. \u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\" Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.

During Tuesday's episode of \"Inside the NBA,\" Barkley was quite outspoken. \"OKC is the best team in the NBA,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve been telling y\u2019all that for two months. Hey, ESPN, I love you guys. Don\u2019t try to make Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA, the face that the NBA is. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Joker [Nikola Jokic], and Giannis [Antetokounmpo]. You can\u2019t give it to people, they have to take it. And Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is taking it.\" Stephen A. Smith, the biggest and loudest face at ESPN, is most guilty of calling Edwards the flawless face of the league. Barkley highlights that ESPN isn\u2019t paying attention, noting that Minnesota is crumbling in the Western Conference Finals while Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander deserves the spotlight. Last season, the Timberwolves lost to the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. ESPN hyped Edwards as the heir apparent to LeBron James, with his eccentric on-camera presence and occasional poster dunks fueling \"next guy up\" buzz. But the reality is, Edwards' struggles to find postseason success hinder that ideal scenario. Facing elimination down 3\u20131 to the Thunder, the Timberwolves and Edwards are losing credibility as serious contenders in the West. While it sounds like a Minnesota issue, Anthony Edwards\u2019 hollow candidacy for \"face of the league\" is a bigger problem for the NBA and ESPN. Falling dramatically short of the NBA Finals for two straight postseasons, the Timberwolves and Edwards lack the pedigree to be the bankable star the NBA needs for ratings once LeBron retires. ESPN will keep carrying water for a league struggling to draw viewers, but without a true star to fill that massive void, the NBA risks another dip in viewership. Today\u2019s league is dominated by European stars like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and newly named MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, alongside Luka Doncic and Victor Wembanyama. Edwards will undoubtedly be a star of the league. Is he the star the NBA needs now? He's not there yet. Charles Barkley, once again, is on the money about his future employers at ESPN.

Barkley called out the network on Inside the NBA for pushing Anthony Edwards as the face of the league and named the three players who are actually worthy of that title.\n\n\u201cHey, ESPN, I love you guys,\" Barkley said. \"Don't try to make Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA. The face of the NBA is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, [Nikola Jokic], and Giannis Antetokounmpo. You can't give it to people, they have to take it, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is taking it.\"\n\nThe media in general, not just ESPN, has been pushing Edwards as the next face of the NBA. While the Minnesota Timberwolves star has been involved in some concerning off-court incidents, his play on the court and his personality have made him the prime candidate in their eyes. The man himself doesn't want that title, though.\n\nEdwards stated he doesn't want to be the face of the NBA, as he just wants to play basketball and go home. He doesn't want to have to deal with all that comes with that title. Despite Edwards' lack of interest, the media still isn't looking elsewhere.\n\nBarkley has presented them with three more deserving candidates. Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo have both won a championship, unlike Edwards, and have been widely regarded as two of the top three players in the NBA for a fairly long time now.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander is now making a strong case to be mentioned in the same breath as Jokic and Antetokounmpo. Gilgeous-Alexander won MVP this year and has the Oklahoma City Thunder on the cusp of the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Thunder are up 3-1 on the Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals, and Gilgeous-Alexander outplaying Edwards is a big reason why. The Canadian is averaging 30.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 8.3 assists, 1.8 steals, and 0.3 blocks per game in this series.\n\nEdwards, meanwhile, is putting up 24.0 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 0.5 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game. Those are solid numbers, but you expect more. The 23-year-old particularly came under fire for his performance in Game 4, where he had 16 points on 5-13 shooting from the field.\n\nEdwards, though, stated postgame that he did not struggle. He claimed he made the right play all night, but the Timberwolves are not going to be able to turn things around if his scoring is limited to this extent again.\n\nKendrick Perkins Explained Why Anthony Edwards Can't Be The Face Of The NBA\n\nWhile many on ESPN have been pushing Edwards as the next face of the NBA, Kendrick Perkins isn't one of them. Perkins explained why Edwards can't get that title just yet.\n\n\"You got to be a role model. And things outside the lines matter. Now, if you go down the list of all the faces of the league in the history of the game, you look at Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Shaq, LeBron, Steph.\"\n\n\"What did they all have in common? While they was playing in the league, they all were family men. They all were married with kids. And if you think that don't play a role in force, the role model, this is facts.\"\n\nEveryone is entitled to their opinion, but this seems a stretch. Would LeBron James not have been the face of the NBA all these years if he hadn't married and had kids? It was his excellence on the court that got him that title, as was the case with everyone else Perkins mentioned.", "summary": "Charles Barkley has fired plenty of shots at ESPN over the years, and he was at it again on Tuesday.

Even if he does not win the NBA Finals, he will have banished all the doubts that he cannot step up to the big stage consistently.\n\nFormer No. 2 overall pick throws Tyrese Haliburton\u2019s name into the ring\n\nThe battle to be the next Face of the NBA was down to Anthony Edwards and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

Released in 1984, the LP \u2014 featuring hits like \u201cOne Night in Bangkok,\u201d \"Anthem\" and \u201cI Know Him So Well\u201d \u2014 was a commercial success, building anticipation for a full stage production.\n\n \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d even reached No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1985.\n\n By 1986, Chess had made it to the stage, in a production directed by Trevor Nunn that debuted in London\u2019s West End. That version was a hit, running for three years and earning praise for its ambitious score and sleek staging.\n\n But when the show crossed the Atlantic in 1988, it faced a rockier path. The Broadway production \u2014 heavily revised with a new book by Richard Nelson \u2014 opened at the Imperial Theatre but closed after just two months, plagued by mixed reviews and behind-the-scenes creative clashes.\n\n The PEOPLE App is now available in the Apple App Store! Download it now for the most binge-worthy celeb content, exclusive video clips, astrology updates and more!\n\n Despite its short-lived Broadway run, Chess gained a loyal following and has been regularly revived around the world in concert stagings, regional productions and high-profile benefits. Among the most notable was a 2008 televised concert staged from London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall that starred Adam Pascal, Josh Groban and Idina Menzel.\n\n A 2018 Kennedy Center production \u2014 with Ra\u00fal Esparza, Ramin Karimloo and Karen Olivo \u2014 was previously believed to be Broadway-bound, though never materialized.\n\n Emmy Award winner Danny Strong (\u201cDopesick\u201d) will pen a new book for this Chess revival. Further members of the creative team, as well as casting and run dates, will be announced shortly.\n\n \"Let the games begin,\" a promo video for the musical released on Wednesday, May 28 teased.\n\n For more information, and to sign up for first access tickets visit www.ChessBroadway.com.", "summary": "The musical will open in Fall 2025 at a Shubert Theater to be announced", "url": "https://people.com/lea-michele-returning-to-broadway-in-chess-revival-alongside-aaron-tveit-and-nicholas-christopher-11738907", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/1r1BfogmWEq08y43RbqpFqx2wDI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(986x330:988x332)/Chess-Broadway-Aaron-Tveit-Lea-Michele-and-Nicholas-Christopher-052725-5964b9bec3094866aedab1aae69e42a5.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-28 13:00:00", "author": "Dave Quinn", "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.79}, {"id": 325768480, "title": "Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit, Nicholas Christopher to Lead Broadway Revival of \u2018Chess\u2019", "text": "Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher will star in a Broadway revival of Chess this fall. \n\n The revival of the musical, which features music by ABBA\u2019s Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Tim Rice, will feature a new book by Dopesick creator Danny Strong.

A win in today's final would put the cherry on top of what will be viewed as a successful transitional season under new manager Enzo Maresca. It would also see the Blues become the first club to win four different major UEFA tournaments, having previously lifted the Cup Winners' Cup (1971, 1998), the Champions League (2012, 2021) and the Europa League. \n\nAfter a tough start to the season, Betis managed a sixth-place finish in La Liga after a big improvement in form at the start of the year, propelled by attacking duo Antony and Isco. Los Verdiblancos claimed an impressive 4-3 aggregate semifinal win over Fiorentina to reach today's showdown in Wroc\u0142aw, but they come into this clash without a victory from their final four domestic fixtures.\n\nReal Betis take on Chelsea on Wednesday, May 28, at the Tarczy\u0144ski Arena in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland, with kickoff set for 9 p.m. CEST local time in Poland. That makes it an 8 p.m. BST start in the UK, a 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT kickoff in the US and Canada, and a 5 a.m. AEST start in Australia on Thursday morning.\n\nLivestream Real Betis vs. Chelsea in the US\n\nAmerican soccer fans can watch the final live on CBS Sports Network, with the channel's coverage also available to stream on Paramount Plus. \n\n How to watch every UEFA Conference League final online from anywhere using a VPN \n\nIf you're traveling abroad and want to watch the UEFA Conference League final while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. \n\nIt encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. \n\nHowever, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN usage to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. \n\nIf you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN usage is crucial. \n\nLivestream Real Betis vs. Chelsea in the UK for free\n\nTNT Sports has the rights to broadcast Uefa Conference League fixtures in the UK, and regular customers can watch the final on TNT Sport 1 as usual. \n\nHowever, the great news for footy fans is that the network has opened up its coverage of this match to nonsubscribers for free via the Discovery Plus streaming service. To watch the match, all you need to do is download the app, register your details online and enjoy the game for free, with no subscription required. \n\nLivestream Real Betis vs. Chelsea in Canada\n\nIf you want to stream UEFA Conference League final live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to DAZN Canada which has exclusive broadcast rights to the showdown in the region.\n\nLivestream Real Betis vs. Chelsea in Australia\n\nFootball fans Down Under can watch the UEFA Conference League final on streaming service Stan Sport, which has exclusive rights to show this tournament live in Australia this season.\n\nQuick tips for streaming UEFA Conference League final using a VPN \n\nWith four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming the Conference League final may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try to fix quickly. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and ensure the address registered for the account is in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. Remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services.
