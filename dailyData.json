(AP) \u2014 Six people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured Sunday at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd. The FBI immediately described the incident as a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d\n\nThe suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the attack on the group of demonstrators, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office.\n\nSoliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn\u2019t elaborate on his injuries.\n\nHere is what we know about the attack:\n\nHow the attack unfolded\n\nSoliman attacked demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since a war between Israel and Hamas sparked in 2023, authorities said.\n\nThe group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder popular with tourists and students.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It occurred more than a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington by a Chicago man who yelled \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza\u201d as he was being led away by police.\n\nPolice in Boulder evacuated multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear.\n\n\u201cOur agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media.\n\nThe violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nSeveral people hospitalized\n\nThose injured range in age from 67 to 88, officials said. All were hospitalized.\n\nPhotos from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground in the fetal position with her hair soaked, and a man helping her and getting water from someone with a water jug.\n\nThe injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of individuals being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.\n\nRedfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.\n\n\u201cIt would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,\u201d he said.\n\nWho the suspect is\n\nMohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene. No charges were immediately announced but officials said they expect to hold him \u201cfully accountable.\u201d\n\nVideo from the scene showed him shirtless and wearing jeans and holding two clear bottles with a transparent liquid in them while shouting at onlookers.\n\nAnother video shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.\n\nFBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department \u2014 which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations \u2014 decried the attack as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts.

Some were left with severe wounds from burns after a man hurled a Molotov cocktail and used a flamethrower on the Run for Their Lives group. Two victims were flown to a nearby hospital\u2019s burn unit via helicopter, according to UCHealth.\n\nThe eldest victim, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, was a Holocaust survivor and the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. \n\nThe attack happened at the start of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday that is marked with the reading of the Torah. It occurred days after police arrested a man who appeared to be a pro-Palestinian activist for allegedly killing two Jews at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat is Run for Their Lives?\n\nRun for Their Lives was started by a group of Jewish people living in California, according to its website. The group hosts a short walk or run every week in events across the country to advocate the release of the hostages Hamas took on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be Jewish or Israeli to be disturbed by this crisis\u2014all people around the world should be,\u201d the website says. \n\n\u201cInnocent children, women, the elderly, and young people should not be living in tunnels 20 meters underground for over a year\u2014they should be in their homes with their families.

The incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which described it as targeted. The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman, was taken into custody. He is facing multiple felony charges as well as a federal hate crime charge.Here is what we know so far.What happened in Boulder?The attack occurred at around 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, near the historic County Courthouse in the city's downtown. It was the site of a march held to advocate for the hostages who were taken from southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and have yet to be released.Witnesses said the suspect used a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and Molotov cocktails to harm demonstrators, leaving multiple people with burns, according to the FBI. The eight who suffered injuries had been standing outside of the courthouse. In the aftermath, a burn scar was visible in front of the courthouse building. Colorado Gov. Jared Polish, who is Jewish, condemned the attack, calling it a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"The FBI's Colorado office said those who attended the march were participating in a scheduled, weekly event. Organized by the group Run for Their Lives, local branches hold community walks and runs in different cities within Colorado, around the country and internationally.\"We are a local chapter of the global initiative Run For Their Lives,\" reads the description of the Boulder chapter's Facebook page. \"We do an 18 minute weekly walk to show international solidarity with the hostages taken from Israel during the 10/7 massacre, and still being held in Gaza. We will walk until they are all released.\"Rachel Amaru, an organizer at Run for Their Lives in Boulder, called the attack \"blatantly antisemitic\" in comments to CBS Colorado. It took place less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy employees were killed in a shooting outside of the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., which is also being investigated as a hate crime.Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives Denver, told CBS News the group contacted Boulder police several times about security concerns around the event prior to Sunday. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.Who was injured in the Boulder attack?Police said the victims of the Boulder attack included four women and four men, whose ages range from 52 to 88. One of them was seriously injured, according to Boulder Police Chief Stephan Redfearn, who said the person had been hospitalized in critical condition.The 88-year-old is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described her as a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at the university, the rabbi said.Two of the injured were flown by helicopter to the burn unit at UCHealth, and four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, according to police and the hospitals. All of the patients at Boulder Community Health had either been discharged or transferred elsewhere later Sunday night, the hospital said, although it did not specify how many were discharged versus transferred.Who is the Boulder attack suspect?The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday. He is facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crimes charge.Witnesses allegedly heard Soliman yell \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence.\" Two sources told CBS News that witnesses who spoke to investigators also alleged the suspect shouted \"End Zionist\" during the attack.The suspect told investigators he \"researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,\" an affidavit filed by the Department of Justice says.He also allegedly \"stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,\" and that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit says.Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the suspect first arrived in the United States in August 2022, originally on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023. She said he filed for asylum a month after arriving in the U.S., in September 2022, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder. After the attack, authorities evacuated three blocks of Pearl Street for the rest of the day as they probed a vehicle of interest in the area, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. On Sunday night, the FBI said it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack\" in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs.FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard have referred to the incident as a terrorist attack.\"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7,\" Gabbard wrote in a social media post.Soliman's former employer, an independently owned medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, called Veros Health, told CBS News that he had a valid work visa while employed there from May 2023 to August 2023.\"We can confirm that Mohamed Soliman worked with Veros from May 2023 to August 2023. He was hired in our accounting department,\" Roni Mushovic, a regional business leader at Vero, said in a statement, noting that Soliman underwent the hiring process through ADP, which handles human resources for the clinic.\"At the time of hire, he was confirmed to have a valid work Visa, which was noted to expire on March 2025,\" Mushovic said. Prior to Sunday's attack, Soliman was driving for Uber, which required him to have a valid Social Security number, CBS News has learned. According to an Uber spokesperson, he passed a background check and provided a photo ID and Social Security number when the company hired him in the spring of 2023, and passed another background check \"about nine months ago.\"", "summary": "A man is in custody for allegedly attacking people at a march in Boulder, Colorado, to support Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boulder-colorado-attack-suspect-molotov-cocktails-israeli-hostage-march/", "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/02/ad61a601-f0ff-4d55-ae3c-2438f87da95a/thumbnail/1200x630/8e466edd94e85957fd74c4c46daaa2f7/gettyimages-2218169894.jpg?v=56a3e14bdf9c98ad3b2e8fa3a2dc5f66", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3799806_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-06-02 19:24:38", "author": "Emily Mae Czachor", "authors": ["Emily Mae Czachor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.43}, {"id": 327436460, "title": "What we know about Colorado firebomb\u00a0suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman", "text": "Suspected Colorado terrorist Mohamed Sabry Soliman is a married dad who allegedly harbored hatred against Jews and told cops he waited until his daughter graduated high school to carry out his fiendish plot.\n\nSoliman, 45, of Colorado Springs \u2014 about 100 miles south of Boulder where the attacks took place \u2014 left messages to his wife and five children hidden in a desk drawer before he left to carry out the attack, which he later told cops had been in the works for more than a year, authorities said.\n\nHe is currently facing federal hate crime charges for perpetrating the monstrous firebomb attack Sunday afternoon on a group of people who gather once a week to remember the Israelis still being held hostage by Hamas.\n\nDuring an interview with investigators after his arrest, Soliman voiced hateful views about Jewish people, stating he wanted to \u201ckill all Zionist people\u201d and that he \u201cwished they all were dead.\u201d However he said he kept a lid on his murderous urges until his daughter\u2019s high school graduation, at which point he allegedly went through with the plot.\n\nThe target of his ire was the group Run For Their Lives, a pro-Israel group who organizes weekly walks in solidarity with Israeli hostages still held by Hamas.

Gun rights advocates say these AR-15s are owned by millions of Americans, and they argue the 2nd Amendment protects weapons that are \"in common use by law-abiding citizens.\" But they fell one vote short of winning a hearing on the question before the Supreme Court. Three conservatives \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 voted to hear the 2nd Amendment challenge. But Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh refused for now to cast the key fourth vote. He called the lower-court ruling upholding Maryland's ban \"questionable,\" but agreed with the majority in turning down the appeal for now. \"In my view, this court should and presumably will address the AR\u201315 issue soon, in the next Term or two,\" Kavanaugh said. The closely watched appeal had been pending since December, and the outcome suggests that the majority, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., is not ready to strike down state laws that restrict semiautomatic guns. Monday's no-comment order lets stand laws in Maryland and Rhode Island that forbid the sale or possession of \"assault weapons\" and large-capacity magazines. California adopted the nation's first ban on assault weapons in 1989. Since then, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Washington have enacted similar laws, all of which would have been struck down if Maryland's law were ruled unconstitutional. Lawmakers in California and nine other Democratic-led states say these rapid-fire weapons are especially dangerous and not needed for self-defense. Maryland said its ban applies to \"certain highly dangerous, military-style assault weapons of the sort used in a series of highly publicized mass shootings.\" The case tested the reach of the 2nd Amendment and its \"right to keep and bear arms.\" For more than a decade, the justices have turned away gun-rights appeals that challenged local or state bans on assault weapons. In 2008, the court ruled for the first time that the 2nd Amendment protects an individual right to self-defense, but its constitutional rulings since then have been modest in their impact. The justices struck down city ordinances in Washington and Chicago that prohibited private possession of handguns, and they ruled states may not deny law-abiding citizens a permit to carry a concealed weapon. In opinion polls, most Americans are opposed to a ban on handgun possession but they support a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles. Maryland passed its ban on \"assault weapons\" after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, where 20 children and six school employees were killed. The law was upheld last year in an opinion written by a prominent conservative judge. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee who was a finalist for a Supreme Court nomination in 2005, said the AR-15, AK-47 and similar rapid-fire rifles are not protected by the 2nd Amendment. \"They are military-style weapons designed for sustained combat operations that are ill-suited and disproportionate to the need for self-defense,\" he wrote in a 9-5 decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. \"We decline to wield the Constitution to declare that military-style armaments which have become primary instruments of mass killing and terrorist attacks in the United States are beyond the reach of our nation's democratic processes.\" The dissenters said the 2nd Amendment protects the right to the \"arms\" that are in common use. \"Today, the AR-15 and its variants are one of the most popular and widely owned firearms in the Nation,\" wrote Judge Julius Richardson, a Trump appointee. \"As of 2021, there are at least 28 million AR-style semiautomatic rifles in circulation. For context, this means that there are more AR-style rifles in the civilian market than there are Ford F-Series pickup trucks on the road \u2014 the most popular truck in America.\" Three years ago, the court said in an opinion by Thomas that the 2nd Amendment should be interpreted based on the nation's history and tradition of gun regulations. However, the two sides in the Maryland case differed on what to glean from that history. Gun-rights advocates said there was no early history of laws banning common firearms. But some judges and state lawyers said the history shows that when new dangers arose \u2014 including stored gunpowder, dynamite and machine guns \u2014 new restrictions were written into law. If so, that would support new laws adopted in response to the danger posed by rapid-fire weapons.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.Maryland's assault-weapons banMaryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection. The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation. Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazinesRhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.", "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-maryland-assault-weapon-ban/", "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/17/b8d308d8-0d85-41ca-8927-ef5ff00422fc/thumbnail/1200x630/9c47fc0545e0a482034d2f8d3f5af7d0/gettyimages-1399070257.jpg?v=15603985a4508c8e7bc83d8e4e73c5d0", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3791701_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-06-02 14:15:34", "author": "Melissa Quinn", "authors": ["Melissa Quinn"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.242}, {"id": 327355480, "title": "Supreme Court won\u2019t hear challenge to Maryland assault weapons ban", "text": "By LINDSAY WHITEHURST, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A split Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a challenge to a state ban on assault weapons, a term referring to semiautomatic rifles that are popular among gun owners and that have also been used in mass shootings.\n\nThe majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the case over weapons like the AR-15, as is typical.

But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement, and a fourth said he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional. \n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken the case, and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cI would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cThat question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR\u201315 owners throughout the country.\u201d\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now, but he said that he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15, one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon. \n\nSeveral states have similar measures, and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15. \n\nThe case comes three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country. \n\nTen states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004. \n\nGun rights groups argue that banning the popular weapons violates people's Second Amendment rights. Attorneys for Maryland contend the guns aren\u2019t protected by the Second Amendment because they\u2019re similar to military-grade weapons.\n\nThe law bans dozens of firearms \u2014 including the AR-15, the AK-47 and the Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifle \u2014 and puts a 10-round limit on gun magazines.\n\nThomas and Kavanaugh have previously expressed skepticism about assault weapon bans.\n\nAs an appeals court judge in 2011, Kavanaugh wrote a dissent saying that a similar measure in Washington, D.C., was unconstitutional. Thomas, meanwhile, dissented in 2015 when the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a municipal ban on AR-15-style weapons, writing that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people who owned the weapons used them for lawful purposes like self-defense.\n\nThe high court in 2022 handed down a ruling that expanded gun rights and told lower-court judges they should no longer consider factors like public safety in deciding whether firearm laws are constitutional. Instead, they should focus on whether a law fits into the nation\u2019s historic tradition of gun ownership, the court said.\n\nThat led to a flurry of challenges to gun laws around the country, multiple restrictions struck down, and confusion among lower-court judges over what gun laws can stay on the books. \n\nSince then, the Supreme Court has overturned a ban on rapid-fire gun accessories called bump stocks but upheld a law barring people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns and regulations on nearly untraceable ghost guns.", "summary": "A high school football coach and teacher in Fauquier County, Virginia, is accused of soliciting nude photos from minors, authorities say. \n\n\n\n\n\nGary Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Hix, 28, of Remington, was arrested Monday on a felony charge for alleged use of communications systems to facilitate offenses involving children, the county sheriff&#8217;s office and Fauquier County Public Schools said in a joint statement Monday. \n\n\n\n\n\nDetectives determined Hix \u201cused Snapchat to solicit nude images from both juveniles and adults who were students and/or football players under his supervision,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office and school district also accuse him of \u201cgrooming behavior\u201d to gain trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trust families place in us to protect and care for their children is sacred, and any violation of that trust is intolerable,\u201d Dr. Major Warner, the school superintendent, said in the statement. &#8220;We are cooperating fully with the Sheriff\u2019s Office and taking all appropriate personnel actions to address this ", "url": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-maryland-assault-weapons-ban/3926190/", "image": "https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/05/SCOTUS-EXT.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 00:00:00", "author": "Lindsay Whitehurst | The Associated Press", "authors": ["Lindsay Whitehurst | The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.256}]}, {"news": [{"id": 327393126, "title": "Suspect in attack on Boulder\u2019s Pearl Street mall charged with federal hate crime", "text": "The man accused of injuring eight people Sunday on Boulder\u2019s Pearl Street Mall with a \u201cmakeshift flamethrower\u201d and Molotov cocktails researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to federal court documents.\n\nMohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old man whom federal officials said was living in Colorado illegally at the time of the attack, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest affidavit.\n\nSoliman threw two lit Molotov cocktails at the crowd of Run for Their Lives demonstrators, burning eight people, the affidavit stated.

(AP) \u2014 A man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group in Boulder, Colorado, that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to court documents filed Monday.\n\nThe suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the \u201cZionist group,\u201d the FBI said. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the attack.\n\nAn FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again.\n\nCourt records show Soliman was scheduled to appear in state court in Boulder at 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.\n\nAttack happened as group finished weekly demonstration\n\nThe eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.\n\nThe attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.\n\nAlex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a \u201cboom\u201d followed by people yelling and screaming.\n\nIn video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.\n\nSuspect reemerged after initial attack before being arrested\n\nAfter the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.\n\nLaw enforcement found more than a dozen unlit Molotov cocktails near where Soliman was arrested. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. Inside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words \u201cIsrael,\u201d \u201cPalestine,\u201d and \u201cUSAID,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nSoliman told investigators he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.\n\n\u201cHe stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nThe group that was attacked has said it was trying to raise attention to the plight of the Israeli hostages in Gaza.\n\nAuthorities say they believe the suspect acted alone\n\nAuthorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.\n\nState and federal authorities planned to hold a news conference Monday afternoon.\n\nSoliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.\n\nPublic records listed Soliman as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene Sunday.\n\nShameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who\u2019d play with Pruiett\u2019s kids in front of their building, share food and hellos. But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.\n\n\u201cThere had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,\u201d Pruiett said.\n\nAnother neighbor, Kierra Johnson, who lives in the apartment next to Soliman\u2019s, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.\n\nOn Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman\u2019s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett. The raid lasted several hours, she said.\n\nAn online resume under Soliman\u2019s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.\n\nFBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,\u201d said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder.\n\nIn New York, the police department said it upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.\n\nIsrael\u2019s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.\n\nThe violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, he arrived in the U.S. in 2022 through California on a non-immigrant visa, which expired in February 2023. He subsequently filed for asylum.\n\n According to the federal criminal complaint, Soliman told investigators that he had planned the attack for a year, looking up how to make Molotov cocktails online, NBC News reports. Per the complaint, there was a container holding at least 14 Molotov cocktails, and a \u201cbackpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance\u201d that was found near the container.\n\n \u201cSoliman stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over \u2018our land,\u2019 which he explained to be Palestine,\u201d the complaint alleges. \u201cHe stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.\u201d\n\n The suspect had recently been living in Colorado Springs, located in El Paso County, Colorado, where the FBI said it was \u201cconducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.\u201d\n\n A group of walkers participating in a Run for Their Lives event that was \u201ccalling for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas,\u201d according to its website, were gathered at the mall where the suspect lodged the attack.

At least one was seriously injured, and potentially in critical condition, Redfearn said Sunday.\n\n The incident occurred around 1:26 p.m. on Sunday, when Boulder dispatch received several calls reporting there was \u201ca man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,\u201d Redfearn said in an earlier afternoon press conference on Sunday.

Law enforcement visited Soliman\u2019s home in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, the affidavit said.\n\nSunday\u2019s attack came less than two weeks after two young Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot in Washington, DC, by a man who claimed to have been acting \u201cfor Gaza.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Jewish community has been warning the world that chants of \u2018globalize the Intifada\u2019 and \u2018resistance by any means necessary\u2019 are calls to violence. We\u2019ve now seen that violence erupt in America twice in less than two weeks,\u201d Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.\n\nHere\u2019s what else we know about the Boulder attack.\n\nA weekly gathering to support Israeli hostages descends into chaos\n\nSunday\u2019s attack took place on the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, where a weekly \u201cRun for Their Lives\u201d event was being held. The event, which has taken place regularly since mid-October 2023, aims to raise awareness of Israeli hostages being held captive by Hamas and calls for their release.\n\n\u201cThis global grass roots organization was founded on October 15, 2023, a week after the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas. \u2026 These walks have been held every week since then for all the hostages \u2013 without any violent incidents until today,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\nSoliman targeted the group after researching them online; he knew about their meeting Sunday and was planning to conduct the attack for a year but was waiting on his daughter to graduate, according to the affidavit.\n\nWitness Brian Horowitz told CNN he and his family were dining at a food hall near the scene when a woman ran toward them saying a man was \u201cthrowing fire\u201d at people.\n\nHorowitz got up and ran into the courtyard, where he saw a man carrying a tank on his back that resembled a gardening chemical sprayer.\n\nAnother man was trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect kept yelling, \u201cf**k you, Zionist,\u201d \u201cyou all deserve to die,\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve killed these children.\u201d\n\nAfter calling 911, Horowitz went to see whether he could assist any victims. He described seeing an elderly woman lying on the ground, unresponsive.\n\n\u201cThere were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was OK,\u201d he said. People from a restaurant across the street were bringing large buckets of ice water to help extinguish the flames, he added.\n\nHe grabbed a bucket and filled it with water from a fountain in the middle of the courtyard, he said. \u201cI just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir pants were completely burned and singed off. It looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.\u201d\n\nMany of the victims are well known in the community, said Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel. She talked to a couple of them, including one woman who is \u201chealing from horrible burns.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe really felt like this happened not just to her, but to the whole community,\u201d Funk said. A mother and daughter were also wounded in the attack, she said.\n\nThe mother \u201cis a Holocaust survivor in her 80s who\u2019s been through certainly enough trauma,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are peaceful people who\u2019ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.\u201d\n\nEvacuation orders in downtown Boulder were lifted Monday morning. Boulder County government office buildings on Pearl Street and 13th Street remained closed.\n\nSuspect not a US national, overstayed tourist visa\n\nVideos obtained by CNN capture Soliman, shirtless, on a patch of grass near an area that has obvious burn marks. Around him are black clouds of smoke.\n\nWitnesses said Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. He was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for treatment of burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.\n\nIn an interview with law enforcement after his arrest, Soliman \u201cstated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again,\u201d the affidavit read.\n\nWhile senior FBI officials have deemed the incident an act of terrorism, authorities are working to determine whether Soliman may have been suffering from mental illness, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nSoliman arrived in the United States in August 2022 on a non-immigrant B2 visa that expired the following February, according to Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSoliman is an Egyptian national, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nHe filed for asylum in September 2022, McLaughlin said on X.\n\nSoliman was granted a work authorization in March 2023, multiple law enforcement officials said. The authorization expired at the end of March 2025, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.\n\nLaw enforcement sources previously told CNN the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005.\n\nJewish leaders on high alert after second antisemitic attack in two weeks\n\n\u201cToday, six people were set on fire by a terrorist in Boulder, Colorado. Why? Because they were calling for 58 hostages still held by Hamas terrorists to finally be returned home,\u201d Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.\n\nThe Boulder attack was part of a \u201cwave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community,\u201d said Eric D. Fingerhut, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Fingerhut outlined a six-point plan for the federal government to address the growing threat.\n\nHis proposals included increasing a non-profit security grant program funding to $1 billion to meet urgent needs, dedicating resources for security personnel at Jewish institutions, bolstering FBI intelligence capabilities to thwart domestic terrorism and holding social media platforms accountable for spreading antisemitic hate and incitement, among others.\n\nIn response to Sunday\u2019s attack, authorities in major cities across the US have deployed extra security at Jewish sites and community centers.\n\nOn Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced in a statement an emergency meeting will be held in City Hall to address heightened security ahead of the Jewish holiday Shavuot, and the Los Angeles Police Department would be conducting \u201cextra patrols at houses of worship and community centers\u201d throughout the city.\n\n\u201cAntisemitism will not be tolerated,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the East Coast, the New York Police Department said its presence has increased at synagogues and other religious sites across the city for Shavuot.\n\nCNN\u2019s Amanda Musa, Josh Campbell, Hanna Park, Matt Rehbein and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/multiple-people-set-fire-attack-231844690.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kI26.1ZkgWe6KCYmOveQzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/8ffc6e1e027574193ccc273c0b0ef345", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 19:55:21", "author": "Katrina Tsui, Holmes Lybrand, Chris Boyette, John Miller, Cnn", "authors": ["Katrina Tsui, Holmes Lybrand, Chris Boyette, John Miller, Cnn"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.37}, {"id": 327440418, "title": "Suspect in Colorado attack charged with attempted murder and a federal hate crime", "text": "Four additional victims have been identified in the Boulder, Colorado, attack in which a man is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, authorities said Monday, bringing the number of injured to 12.\n\nThe man planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a \u201cZionist group,\u201d authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime.\n\nWitnesses in Boulder said the suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices.\n\nFederal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment that may include amended allegations.\n\nAn FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people,\u201d a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.\n\n\u201cHe said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,\u201d police wrote. \u201cMohamed described his hopes for everyone in the Zionist group to die.\u201d\n\nFederal court records don't list the name of an attorney who could speak on Soliman's behalf and no one answered the door at a Colorado Springs townhouse where public records show he lived.\n\nThe burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.\n\nSix victims hospitalized\n\nThe victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims suffered what police described as minor injuries.\n\nSix of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.\n\nThe attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.\n\nAlex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a \u201cboom\u201d followed by people yelling and screaming.\n\nIn video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.\n\nMolotov cocktails found\n\nSoliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, even purchasing flowers from Home Depot, police wrote. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn\u2019t spray it on anyone but himself \u201cbecause he had planned on dying.\u201d\n\nHe told investigators he only threw two Molotov cocktails at the group \u201cbecause he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,\u201d police wrote.\n\nAfter the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it.

Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.\n\nAn online resume under Soliman\u2019s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt.

An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump.Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban lauded Nawrocki's win, according to French news agency AFP. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Nawrocki. In a post on X, she said she's \"confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland.\" Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister, who is chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6. Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once. Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide - so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples. But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared undemocratic. Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU. Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.Incoming president's backgroundNawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start. The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who wouldn't be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule. The strategy clearly worked. Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports. Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with. Nawrocki's candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \"noble\" fights in his life. The revelations didn't seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.Nawrocki endorsed by Trump Mr. Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president. He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week, the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him. The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president. A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Mr. Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration. Nawrocki has also echoed some of Mr. Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.For his part, Zelenskyy said Monday he wants to work with Nawrocki, AFP reported. \"I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally,\" Zelensky said in social media post.NATO chief Mark Rutte congratulated Nawrocki on Monday, vowing to work together to boost the alliance in the face of the threat from Russia, according to AFP.But Polish far-right leader Slawomir Mentzen said his supporters expect Nawrocki to put Poland's interests above those if its neighbor, Ukraine, AFP noted.", "summary": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election, beating Warsaw's liberal mayor, according to the final vote count.

Nawrocki won 50.89% of the vote, gaining a narrow victory over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%, the Associated Press reported. The first round of voting two weeks ago revealed deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6. Trzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Nawrocki on Monday, thanking all those who voted for him. POLAND\u2019S SOARING ECONOMY SETS STAGE FOR TIGHT PRESIDENTIAL RACE AS US, EU WATCH CLOSELY \"I fought for us to build a strong, safe, honest, and empathetic Poland together,\" he wrote on X. \"I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to convince the majority of citizens of my vision for Poland. I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t win together.\" U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last week stumped for Nawrocki at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Warsaw, where she also slammed \"weak\" European leaders who she argued have allowed mass migration of having \"destroyed their civilizations.\" Noem praised Poland\u2019s strict border enforcement, warning that \"socialists\" like Trzaskowski would take such protections away from the Polish people. Trump hosted Nawrocki at the White House in early May during the conservative candidate's campaign. Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among the leaders offering their congratulations to Nawrocki on Monday morning. \"Poland, which preserves the strength of its national spirit and its faith in justice, has been and remains a pillar of regional and European security, and a strong voice defending freedom and dignity for every nation,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"By reinforcing one another on our continent, we give greater strength to Europe in global competition and bring the achievement of real and lasting peace closer. I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally.\" The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president. A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration. POLAND ORDERS RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN KRAKOW CLOSED AFTER BLAMING KREMLIN FOR 2024 ARSON Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who shares Nawrocki's national conservative worldview, hailed Nawrocki's \"fantastic victory.\" Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered measured congratulations, emphasizing continued EU-Poland collaboration rooted in shared democratic values: \"We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values. So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home.\" Nawrocki's victory is a comeback for the Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist coalition. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Duda's veto power has been one obstacle to the pro-European Union Tusk in fulfilling certain electoral promises, such as loosening restrictions on abortion or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples. Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.

The president then signalled that the U.S. may retaliate against this alleged non-compliance, saying: \u201cSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d In his post, the president claimed his tariffs had put China in \u201cgrave economic danger\u201d and he made a \u201cFAST DEAL\u201d in Geneva, \u201cin order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation.\u201d\n\nWhat Do We Know About The Current State Of U.s.-China Trade Talks?\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that trade talks with China were \u201ca bit stalled,\u201d but said he believes U.S. officials will be \u201chaving more talks with them in the next few weeks.\u201d Bessent did not specify any sticking points that have prevented the talks from progressing, but noted that he believes a direct call between Trump and Xi will be needed to close the deal. \u201cI think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,\u201d the treasury secretary said. Bessent then added that Trump and Xi have a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d and he was \u201cconfident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known.\u201d\n\nKey Background\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials met in Geneva last month to discuss a resolution to a spiraling trade war between the two countries, triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d After the meeting both sides announced they had agreed to significantly cut back tariffs placed on each other\u2019s goods for at least 90 days, while continuing discussions on a broader trade deal. As part of the agreement, both sides agreed to lower their \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on each other from 125% to 10%. However, a separate 20% tariff on Chinese goods imposed by Trump earlier this year\u2014over China\u2019s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis in the U.S.\u2014would remain in effect, keeping the overall tariffs on Chinese goods at 30%. The talks came after both sides engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war which saw U.S. levies on China hit 145% while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were raised to 125%. While announcing the deal, Bessent acknowledged that the spiraling tariffs were equivalent to a trade embargo and said \u201cneither side wants that.\u201d\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nNo meetings have taken place between the two sides since the Geneva talks. In their joint statement, both sides had agreed to \u201cestablish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations.\u201d Bessent and Greer will represent the U.S. side in these discussions, while Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side. These future talks were set to be held alternately in China and the U.S. or in a third country that both sides agree upon. It is unclear how these proposed meetings will be handled amid the latest round of tensions. After the Geneva deal announcement, Trump also said he was looking forward to talk with Xi, but that also hasn\u2019t happened so far.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Accuses China Of Violating U.S. Trade Agreement (Forbes)\n\nBessent Says China Trade Talks \u2018Are A Bit Stalled\u2019\u2014U.S. Futures Slip (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland.

Allegations suggest Nawrocki promised to care for Jerzy in return but failed to fulfill the commitment, leading the man to end up in a publicly funded retirement home.\n\nHis shifting explanations raised questions about his transparency and credibility. After the scandal erupted he donated the apartment to a charity.\n\nIt recently emerged that Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk brawl involving about 140 rival soccer fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of \u201cnoble\u201d combat. \n\nPolish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution.\n\nHis critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state but many right-wing voters don\u2019t believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him.\n\nIt's unclear what effect, if any, these scandals had on the outcome of Sunday's result.", "summary": "Poles awakened Monday to a clear albeit close result that returns a nationalist politician to the presidency who has pledged to hinder the centrist, pro-EU government for the remainder of its term", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/karol-nawrocki-polands-newly-elected-conservative-president-122407145", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/49730423-574e-447b-a868-73232e721f99/wirestory_bb028ee68b5677d9195707fb4a6947c1_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 06:46:27", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.037}, {"id": 327207036, "title": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki wins Poland's presidential election", "text": "WARSAW, Poland -- Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday.

For much of the night, the election had been considered too close to call.\n\nMr Trzaskowski, of the ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO), and Mr Nawrocki, a nationalist historian and amateur boxer backed by nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), were locked in a race that Polish broadcaster TVP called \u201cthe most even\u201d in the country\u2019s history.\n\nDespite an initial exit poll showing no decisive winner, both men declared victory early \u2013 Mr Trzaskowski told his supporters, \u201cwe won by a whisker\u201d, while Mr Nawrocki posted on X: \u201cThank you all! We will triumph.\u201d\n\nMr Trzaskowski had been expected to prevail \u2013 though by less than one percentage point \u2013 until a second exit poll suddenly put Mr Nawrocki ahead.\n\nThe final exit poll released at 1am local time had a +/- 0.5 per cent margin of error and still showed Mr Nawrocki in the lead.\n\nAs results trickled in throughout the night, the country anxiously awaited the outcome of an election which will determine the ability of the centrist government, led by prime minister Donald Tusk, to deliver on its agenda.\n\nA win for Mr Nawrocki gives a much-needed boost to PiS, who lost power in 2023 after eight years.\n\nA PiS ally, Andrzej Duda, is the current holder of the Polish presidency, and has spent the last several years stonewalling Mr Tusk\u2019s policies.\n\nMr Trzaskowski, 53, campaigned on a promise to help Mr Tusk\u2019s government complete its democratic reforms, which they both say aim to repair an erosion of checks and balances under the previous nationalist government.\n\nParliament holds most of the power in Poland, but the president can veto legislation, so the vote is being watched closely in neighbouring Ukraine, as well as in Russia, the US and across the European Union.\n\nBoth candidates agreed on the need to spend heavily on defence, as Mr Trump is demanding from Europe, and to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s three-year-old invasion.\n\nBut while Mr Trzaskowski sees Ukraine\u2019s future membership of Nato as essential for Poland\u2019s security, Mr Nawrocki said recently that if he were president he would not ratify it because of the danger of the alliance being drawn into war with Russia.\n\nThe race has also drawn the attention of the Polish diaspora, who are allowed to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections and overwhelmingly favoured Mr Trzaskowski, with the exception of Poles in the US and Canada who leaned toward Mr Nawrocki.\n\nBoth candidates had hinted at the high stakes on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to save Poland,\u201d Mr Nawrocki said after the first round.\n\n\u201cI told you eight months ago it would be very close \u2013 and it is very close,\u201d Mr Trzaskowski said.\n\nMr Trzaskowski narrowly came out on top in the first round, winning 31.4 per cent of the vote to Mr Nawrocki\u2019s 29.5 percent.\n\nOne Ipsos poll breakdown found that Mr Trzaskowski led among Poles aged 40-59.\n\nThe PiS, meanwhile, narrowly took the 60-plus bracket, while younger Poles tended to break for other parties either on the far Right or far Left.\n\nSince then, the two run-off candidates have been appealing to supporters of the other parties, with centrist and leftist candidates defeated in the first round endorsing Mr Trzaskowski.\n\nMr Nawrocki got a boost from the Trump administration\u2019s Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary.\n\n\u2018Train wreck\u2019\n\nIn a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Poland last week, she called Mr Trzaskowski \u201ca train wreck\u201d.\n\nThe Trump White House has enjoyed warm relations with Mr Duda, the current Polish president, and was looking to continue them under another PiS-backed president.\n\nMr Nawrocki travelled to Washington earlier this year to meet with Mr Trump.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, Mr Tusk emphasised broad security concerns, including the threat of \u201cweaponised\u201d migration from Poland\u2019s border with Russian ally Belarus.\n\nHe has also criticised the European Green Deal, while calling for a complete phase-out of fossil fuels from Russia, more defence spending in Europe, and for Ukraine to eventually be admitted into Nato.\n\nDomestically, his government also oversaw a public apology to LGBT people in Poland through state television, efforts to depoliticise courts that have been packed with PiS loyalists over the last 10 years, and moves to liberalise abortion access.\n\nHowever, many of the reforms on Mr Tusk\u2019s current to-do list remain hamstrung in the country\u2019s current political deadlock between prime minister and president.\n\nVoter turnout in the election hit a record high of 71.7 per cent, according to the poll, besting the 68.23 per cent who voted in the 1995 presidential race.\n\nFull results are expected on Monday.", "url":

His supporters fear Mr Trzaskowski\u2019s pro-EU position could cede too much control over Polish affairs to European powers like France and Germany.\n\nMany European centrists had rallied behind Mr Trzaskowski, viewing him as a defender of democratic values at a time when they were under threat from rising authoritarianism worldwide.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/eurosceptic-nationalist-nawrocki-elected-poland-051319488.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fu5oAuVc5_fyxNmDA4Ii1A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1fb96c1a50c019d4c1d7e070f72adfb3", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 08:38:13", "author": "Shweta Sharma", "authors": ["Shweta Sharma"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.186}, {"id": 327428146, "title": "Poland aligns with US over Europe as Trump ally Nawrocki becomes president", "text": "As President Andrzej Duda, a Law and Justice statesman, was set to end his second and final term, Polish politicos expected the party\u2019s last stronghold in national politics to be lost to their center-left rivals.\n\nWhen Nawrocki finished the first round of the presidential election less than 2% behind Civic Platform candidate Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the odds-on favorite, that narrative shifted dramatically. After two weeks of high-octane campaigning ahead of the final round, the underdog outsider emerged victorious on Sunday.\n\nNawrocki, 42, is seen as a clean slate for a conservative movement in Poland that hopes to join the growing worldwide coalition for \u201cnormality\u201d that they believe is being led by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe election outcome symbolizes ascending nationalism in Poland and growing disillusionment with the liberal reforms championed by the governing Civic Platform party, chaired by Tusk.\n\nTusk endorsed Civic Platform candidate Trzaskowski, a left-wing centrist and current mayor of Warsaw.\n\nTrzaskowski conceded defeat not long after the results were published, acknowledging Nawrocki\u2019s victory but striking a distinctly crestfallen tone.\n\n\u201cI fought for us to build a strong, safe, honest, and empathetic Poland together,\u201d Trzaskowski wrote on social media following his defeat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to convince the majority of citizens of my vision for Poland.

He is outspoken against liberalizing the country\u2019s attitudes toward abortion, accommodations for LGBT lifestyles, and secularization.\n\nBut most concerning for his critics is the presidential office\u2019s array of powers on the international level.\n\nNawrocki will be the nation\u2019s preeminent foreign policy leader, and his attention is focused much more on Washington, D.C., than Brussels.\n\nHe is highly critical of European Union policies that he believes threaten the nation\u2019s sovereignty. He believes Poland must reassert its sovereignty in the face of these alleged encroachments.\n\nMuch of Tusk\u2019s progressive reforms have been done at least partially to appease EU organs that deemed Polish politics incongruous with other Western liberal democracies. Duda has ignored these attempts to cater to Germany and Belgium, and Nawrocki is expected to continue the obstruction.\n\nNawrocki also stands athwart the EU\u2019s push for greater solidarity with Ukraine.\n\nHe has been critical of Poland becoming too involved in the Russia-Ukraine War, promising to unilaterally block any attempts to bring the smaller state into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nThat position did not stop Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from congratulating the next Polish president and appealing for \u201ccontinued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoland, which preserves the strength of its national spirit and its faith in justice, has been and remains a pillar of regional and European security, and a strong voice defending freedom and dignity for every nation,\u201d Zelensky wrote on social media. \u201cBy reinforcing one another on our continent, we give greater strength to Europe in global competition and bring the achievement of real and lasting peace closer.\u201d\n\nDistrust from fellow European nations is counter-balanced by the enthusiastic support received from the White House.\n\nNawrocki enjoys the public support of high-profile administration officials such as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who vouched for the candidate last week at a Conservative Political Action Conference event in Warsaw.\n\n\u201cI just had the opportunity to meet with Karol and listen \u2014 he needs to be the next president of Poland,\u201d Noem told the crowd in her speech. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d\n\nThe Homeland Security secretary promised that if Poland elects \u201ca leader that will work with President Donald J. Trump,\u201d the Polish people \u201cwill be able to fight off enemies that do not share your values.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will have strong borders and protect your communities and keep them safe, and ensure that your citizens are respected every single day,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou will continue to have a U.S. presence here, a military presence.

Garcia was greeted with boos during the medal ceremony, which then led the trans athlete to send a scathing message to critics who dare believe girls' sports should be exclusive to biological females. Garcia won the girls' 2A 400-meter dash with a time of 55.70 in the girls' division, which was nearly a full second faster than the runner-up in the race, Lauren Matthew. Garcia, who attends East Valley High School, a year ago became Washington's first trans athlete to win a state title. So, just to recap, a full year had passed between Garcia's first state title that made a mockery of young female athletes, and state and school officials did nothing. A video of this weekend's medal ceremony shared by OutKick's Riley Gaines shows the crowd cheering on the athletes as they're announced and step onto the platform. Garcia, however, was met with boos after having their name called as the state champion. Garcia later shared a message for all the critics, also known as the people who were sticking up for biological females in girls' sports. \"I\u2019ll be honest, I kind of expect it,\" Garcia told the Seattle Times. \"But it maybe didn\u2019t have their intended effect.

Garcia did not break any rules by competing because adults are either too scared, liberal, or both to make any rules to begin with. Matthew, who proudly held up a sign about being the real girls' state champion after the race, had a fair and strong assessment of the situation. \"I shouldn\u2019t have to push myself to the point of where I\u2019m about to, like, die in order to win,\" Matthew told the Spokesman-Review. \"I know I\u2019m gonna push myself to keep going, but I don\u2019t want a man pushing me to have to go.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.outkick.com/sports/trans-athlete-veronica-garcia-state-championship-washington-girls-track-boos-critics-get-life", "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/06/track-and-field-girls-creative.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 11:35:53", "author": "Mark Harris", "authors": ["Mark Harris"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.252}, {"id": 327329776, "title": "Trans athlete fires message toward critics after dominating girls' 400 for state title", "text": "Ver\u00f3nica Garcia, a transgender competitor, has been on top of the competition in the girls\u2019 400-meter races during the Washington state outdoor season in 2025 and finished in first place during the state championships on Saturday.

Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October, with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time, place and manner of federal elections.If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue, their lawsuit could proceed. The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted. Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts.\"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court.\"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\"But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after.\"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\"", "summary": "GOP Rep.

We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won\u2019t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America.

Here\u2019s what those families want you to know - AP News", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.\n\nThe 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.\n\nStill, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.\n\nKennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d\n\nHis comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder. \n\nSome worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.\n\nOhio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who\u2019s 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d\n\nLife with autism can be a daily struggle\n\nWhile announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.\n\nFor Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.\n\nDaniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.\n\n\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out. \n\n\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d\n\nEileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.\n\nDays in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.\n\nAt 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.\n\nLamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.\n\n\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d\n\nCopeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger. \n\nKennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.\n\nThe quest to determine autism\u2019s cause has proven elusive\n\nKennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.\n\nAshley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.\n\n\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nDoctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.\n\nKennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.\n\nBoth he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.\n\nLast week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.\n\nEileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link.

Here\u2019s what those families want you to know", "text": "By AMANDA SEITZ\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.\n\nThe 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.\n\nStill, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.\n\nKennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d\n\nHis comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.\n\nSome worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.\n\nOhio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who\u2019s 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d\n\nLife with autism can be a daily struggle\n\nWhile announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.\n\nFor Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.\n\nDaniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.\n\n\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.\n\n\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d\n\nEileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.\n\nDays in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.\n\nAt 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.\n\nLamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.\n\n\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d said Lamb, who is also the director of social media at the national organization Autism Speaks. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d\n\nCopeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.\n\nKennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.\n\nThe quest to determine autism\u2019s cause has proven elusive\n\nKennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.\n\nAshley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.\n\n\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nDoctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.\n\nKennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.\n\nBoth he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.\n\nLast week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.\n\nEileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she\u2019d like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago.

Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.\n\nKennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d\n\nHis comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.\n\nSome worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.\n\nOhio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who\u2019s 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d\n\nLife with autism can be a daily struggle\n\nWhile announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.\n\nFor Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.\n\nDaniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.\n\n\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.\n\n\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d\n\nEileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.\n\nDays in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.\n\nAt 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.\n\nLamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.\n\n\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d said Lamb, who is also the director of social media at the national organization Autism Speaks. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d\n\nCopeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.\n\nKennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.\n\nThe quest to determine autism\u2019s cause has proven elusive\n\nKennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.\n\nAshley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.\n\n\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nDoctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.\n\nKennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.\n\nBoth he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.\n\nLast week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.\n\nEileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she\u2019d like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.\n\n\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d", "summary": "His stark comments have splintered a community of millions of people.", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/06/02/rfk-jr-autism-facts/", "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RFK_Jr._Autism_39089-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 15:20:03", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.049}, {"id": 327371060, "title": "RFK Jr. says autism \u2018destroys\u2019 families.

You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns \u2b1b\ufe0f, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. \ud83d\udfe8 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. \ud83d\udfe9 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.\nYour second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.\nAfter that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above.\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.\n\nKerry Brunskill\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nContributing Writer\n\nWhen baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

Welcome to the start of a new week. We hope you're well-rested, feeling energized and ready to keep your Wordle streak rolling for as long as possible. In case you'd like some assistance with that, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Monday's puzzle (#1,444).\n\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that too.\n\nWhat is Wordle?\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. The gist is that there is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nHow to play Wordle\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nHow to play Wordle more than once a day\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,400 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nPrevious Wordle answers\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Sunday, June 1 \u2014 ROUGH\n\nSaturday, May 31 \u2014 HABIT\n\nFriday, May 30 \u2014 IDIOM\n\nThursday, May 29 \u2014 QUASH\n\nWednesday, May 28 \u2014 POLAR\n\nToday's Wordle hints explained\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly.

He won Offensive Player of the Year as he led the league in rushing, going for 2,005 yards. He fell 100 yards short of Eric Dickerson's longstanding regular-season record, missing the chance to break it by sitting in the Eagles' regular-season finale. He also rushed for 13 touchdowns, adding 33 receptions for 278 yards and two touchdowns during the regular season.

He ran for 499 yards in Philadelphia's four playoff games, helping it win its second Super Bowl. Barkley's 2,504 total rushing yards for the season broke the record Pro Football Hall of Famer set in 1998 (2,476 yards). \"Saquon's reverse hurdle was one of the rare, defining moments in NFL history that would have once been described as 'something out of a videogame,'\" \"Madden NFL\" VP, Franchise Strategy & Marketing Evan Dexter said in a news release. \"Now, it\u2019s a display of the athleticism and creativity of one football's most electrifying athletes.

Among its losses was a prohibition on using an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe most recent emergency filing arrived May 27.\n\nA judge rebuked the administration over deportations to South Sudan\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s latest appeal asks the high court to halt an order by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston. The White House violated his earlier order, Murphy found, with a deportation flight bound for the African nation carrying people from other countries who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.\n\nThose immigrants must get a real chance to raise any fears that being sent there could put them in danger, Murphy wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, asked for an immediate high court order that would allow the third-country deportations to resume.\n\nMurphy has stalled efforts to carry out deportations of migrants who can\u2019t be returned to their home countries, Sauer wrote.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Larian)\n\nWhile Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios is parting ways with the Dungeons & Dragons license for its next project, the tabletop RPG's publisher, Wizards of the Coast, is keen for more D&D video games. WotC has just signed Giant Skull, a new studio led by God of War 3 and Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen, for a new, single-player game set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nThe game is described as \"an all-new, single-player action-adventure title set in the world of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS\" in a press release. The project is currently in development on Unreal Engine 5 for release on \"PC and console.\"\n\"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity,\" Asmussen, who serves as CEO at Giant Skull, says in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to craft a rich new DUNGEONS & DRAGONS universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.\"\n\nYou may like\n\nIf you're craving more D&D after Baldur's Gate 3, Critical Role is \"hard at work\" on a video game \u2013 and it'll be unveiled \"any day\" now\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke says Larian is \"deep in the trenches\" with its \"crazy ambitious\" new RPG, and that \"I hope I can tell you 5 years from now\" that \"we cracked it\"\n\nDragon Age: The Veilguard director is leading an unannounced game for Wizards of the Coast, which recently hinted at more Baldur's Gate\n\nMore details on the game will \"be revealed at a later date.\" Wizards is also working on several other D&D video game projects, including one led by the director of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\n\nAsmussen worked on the God of War series for years, eventually directing God of War 3 in 2010. More recently, he served as game director for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. With that kind of pedigree in big-budget action-adventure games, it starts getting easier to picture what this D&D title might look like.\nWe interviewed Asmussen about Giant Skull a little over a year ago, and at the time, it sounded as if the studio was still weighing whether it wanted to create a licensed game or \"something that we own that's original to us.\" Clearly, the possibilities of D&D were tough to ignore.\nGiant Skull has been billed as a AAA indie studio with a core team of industry veterans. We've certainly seen that approach pay off for games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but it remains to be seen how many studios can follow that path to success.\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\"The word AAA gets thrown around a lot, and it's an easy bullet point when you do a press release,\" Asmussen told us in 2024. \"But what I feel that means is it's premium quality, where we had the time to execute on our vision, we had the support to execute on our vision to create something that really summarizes that, and will be a well-rounded and thoughtful experience for the player.\"\nExpect a whole lot more about new games as the Summer Game Fest schedule 2025 closes in.\n\nSee more Games News\n\nDustin Bailey\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nStaff Writer\n\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Giant Skull)\n\nLarian is out of the D&D game and that's left Wizards of the Coast scrambling a little bit to figure out how to follow it up. Today the studio revealed at least one of its plans for a post-Baldur's Gate 3 world: A publishing deal with Giant Skull for \"an all-new singleplayer action-adventure title set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\"\n\nYou may recall Giant Skull as the studio founded in 2024 by Stig Asmussen, the director of Star Wars Jedi: games, who left Respawn in 2023 \"to pursue other adventures.\" Well, a change is as good as a rest, I suppose, even if it's just a change of scenery.\nIn any event, Asmussen brought in veterans of other studios including Riot, Epic Games, and Rocksteady for his new thing, and now we've got... well, not much of a look at what's cooking, really, except that it's D&D.\n\nYou may like\n\nWizards of the Coast gaming head says Baldur's Gate 3 'certainly raised the bar' and changed how they think about big budget D&D, but they still want 'different entry points' including smaller games\n\nHasbro will be ready to share news about the future of Baldur's Gate 'in pretty short order'\n\nWith Larian finally at the end of its journey with Baldur's Gate 3, what do we want next from the new kings of the RPG?\n\n\"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity,\" Asmussen said. \"Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons and Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.\"\n\nNot a whole lot to go on there, and before anyone asks, no, I don't know what \"exhilarating traversal\" means. I do still get a bit of a tingle when I hear the words \"you must gather your party before venturing forth,\" but that's probably not the same thing.\nWizards of the Coast president John Hight, who previously worked with Asmussen on the God of War series, was equally not-informative, saying that \"worldbuilding and storytelling is in our DNA, and this collaboration reflects our evolution and commitment to our Playing to Win Strategy, building a stronger presence in digital play.\"\nCarefully crafted corporate statements that expend a whole lot of words to say not much of anything always make me a little itchy, and following up on a monster success like Baldur's Gate 3 is no small task. That said, Asmussen has a pretty solid track record for this sort of thing: Prior to the Star Wars Jedi games, he served as game director on the acclaimed God of War 3. Even if Giant Skull's D&D game doesn't deliver a bigger and better experience than BG3 (and I don't think anyone reasonably assumes it will), I'm still hopeful it'll be quite good.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nGiant Skull's D&D game is being developed for PC and consoles in Unreal Engine 5.

Longtime Lions center Frank Ragnow has announced his retirement from the NFL after seven seasons, he announced Monday. \"These past couple of months have been very trying as I\u2019ve come to the realization that my football journey is ending and I\u2019m officially retiring from the NFL,\" Ragnow wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. \"I\u2019ve tried to convince myself that I\u2019m feeling good but I\u2019m not and it\u2019s time to prioritize my health and my families future. I have given this team everything I have and I thought I had more to give, but the reality is I simply don\u2019t. I have to listen to my body and this has been one of the hardest decisions of my life. \"The Lions organization has been absolutely incredible throughout this process and I can\u2019t emphasize this enough how grateful I am for this team and all the fans. It was an absolute honor going to battle for you all.\" Ragnow, who turned 29 in May, has been one of the key reasons why the Lions have made their sudden turnaround from being one of the league's bottom dwellers to a Super Bowl contender in recent years. He was named a Pro Bowler for the fourth time in 2024, earning a second-team All-Pro honor for the third time in his career as well. In terms of advanced metrics, Ragnow graded out as Pro Football Focus' third-best center for the 2024 season. It credited him for allowing just two sacks and 21 pressures, including the postseason. Those numbers helped the Lions finish in the top 10 for the fewest sacks allowed for a third straight season, as Ragnow led an offensive line that's been widely regarded as one of the best in the league over the last few years. Ragnow also didn't miss much time over the last three seasons, sitting out just four games over that period. However, he played with a partially torn pectoral muscle for much of the 2024 season. In 2023, Ragnow only missed one game after undergoing surgery to repair his meniscus. He later suffered a sprained ankle and knee during the Lions' NFC Divisional Round win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that season, but didn't miss a snap. Prior to the 2022 season, Ragnow also dealt with a turf toe injury that cost him 13 games in 2021. He fractured his throat during a game in 2020 as well, playing the remainder of that tilt before missing two weeks. Losing Ragnow this late in the offseason is obviously a blow for the Lions, especially as they have hopes to win the NFC North for a third straight year. Second-round rookie Tate Ratledge has taken snaps at the position during the team's offseason workouts, but he played guard during his time at Georgia. Veteran guard Graham Glasgow has also played the position in the past. Ragnow is one of the few key pieces of the Lions' offense to depart this offseason as well. Offensive coordinator Ben Johnson departed to become the next head coach of the Chicago Bears, while right guard Kevin Zeitler left in free agency to sign a deal with the Tennessee Titans.

He went on to not miss a start after that, playing 16 games and being named to the Pro Bowl for the third straight season.\n\nHe was selected by the Lions in the first round, No. 20 overall, of the 2018 NFL Draft out of Arkansas and spent his entire seven-year career in Detroit.", "summary": "The retirement comes as a blow to the Super Bowl contender, which is coming off a 15-2 season.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2025/06/02/sports/lions-frank-ragnow-suddenly-retires-from-nfl-at-29-in-major-blow/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/newspress-collage-8qxl7gq97-1748884283134.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1748870084&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 19:16:39", "author": "Bridget Reilly", "authors": ["Bridget Reilly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.061}, {"id": 327417160, "title": "Detroit Lions center Frank Ragnow announces retirement after 7 seasons - Detroit Free Press", "text": "Four-time Pro Bowl center Frank Ragnow, one of the most important players on a Detroit Lions offensive line that is considered one of the best in the NFL, is calling it a career.\n\nRagnow wrote on Instagram that he is retiring after seven seasons with the Lions for health reasons.\n\n\"These past couple of months have been very trying as I've come to the realization that my football journey is ending and I'm officially retiring from the NFL,\" Ragnow wrote. \"I've tried to convince myself that I'm feeling good but I'm not and it's time to prioritize my health and my families (sic) future.\"\n\nRagnow, a first-round pick out of Arkansas in 2018, played in 16 games and was a second-team All-Pro selection last season, when he said after the season he felt as healthy as he'd been in years.\n\nRagnow has battled toe problems since 2021, when he tore the plantar plate in his left foot in a Week 4 game against the Chicago Bears and missed the rest of the year. He re-injured his toe in 2022, and called the ailment inoperable in the spring of 2023.\n\nThat fall, Ragnow made his third Pro Bowl after playing 16 games despite toe, knee and ankle injuries. He acknowledged after the season he was contemplating his future, then returned with another Pro Bowl performance last year, when he played through a partially torn pectoral muscle.\n\nRagnow, who turned 29 last month and had two years left on his contract, was not taking part in formal offseason workouts with the Lions this spring.

Like the toughness, like the way he plays the game.\n\n\"The guy can get out in space, man. Those guys that can get out in space and block for a guy like Jahmyr Gibbs and then he\u2019s going to the house for a touchdown, you love those guys. So I\u2019m excited about Tate, man. I\u2019m really, really, really excited about Tate.\"\n\nRatledge took first- and second-team reps at center during the Lions' installation period at their open organized team activities practice last week, when Lions coach Dan Campbell downplayed the absence of Ragnow and veteran linebacker Alex Anzalone from voluntary workouts.\n\nRatledge said at rookie minicamp in May he was enjoying the transition, but still trying to learn all three interior line positions\n\nVeteran interior lineman Graham Glasgow, who started last season at left guard and played right guard in 2023, also has experience at center; he started all 16 games at the position for the Lions in 2018. Colby Sorsdal and Michael Niese also saw time at center last week, and center Kingsley Eguakun spent last season on the Lions' practice squad as an undrafted rookie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from guard of course, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve had prior experience, too, playing center so it\u2019s nothing brand new to me,\" Ratledge said. \"So coming back out here and getting in the feel of it.

It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year. \n\nMonths after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.\n\nStarmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.\n\nDefense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow, and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a historic low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.\n\nHealey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there's \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034. \n\nStarmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.\n\nStarmer said he wouldn't make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d\n\nEven 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.\n\nMonday's announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines.

He served as the club\u2019s director of player personnel and scouting until 2019 and has been an assistant general manager for the past six years.\n\nAinge has played a significant role in the Celtics\u2019 scouting and pre-draft process over the past decade-plus.

The soft-tossing left-hander held his former team to one run on four hits over six innings as the Yankees avoided a sweep with a 7-3 victory over the Dodgers Sunday.\n\nYarbrough lulled the Dodgers\u2019 hitters to sleep with his side-arm arsenal featuring a four-seam fastball that topped out at an out-of-fashion 89.5 mph and a sinker that only reached 87.5 mph. But most of his pitches were either a cutter at an average of 82.2 mph, a changeup at 77.6 mph or a sweeper even slower, 70.8 mph.\n\nTwenty-two of Yarbrough\u2019s 93 pitches strolled up to the plate leisurely at less than 73 mph. The slow-speed chase produced 17 swings-and-misses (seven on his sweeper) and lots of soft contact.

Andy Pages dumped a double into the right field corner, then was promptly thrown out trying to steal third base, making Tommy Edman\u2019s fly ball into the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen a solo home run.\n\nIn a pitching matchup that looked lopsided in the Dodgers\u2019 favor, Yoshinobu Yamamoto was the one who couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nThe calm, cool precision that has typified Yamamoto\u2019s starts this season was not in evidence Sunday. He needed 28 pitches to get through the first inning, stranding the bases loaded and holding the Yankees to just one run despite two hits and two walks.\n\nHe stranded another runner at third in the second but walked Aaron Judge to start the third \u2013 reacting out of frustration with himself after missing his spot for ball four. On an 0-and-2 count, he missed again, leaving a splitter over the plate to Ben Rice, who sent it on a 425-foot journey to dead center field for a two-run home run.\n\nTwo more hits and a wild pitch \u2013 a splitter that gave in to gravity after just 50 feet \u2013 led to another Yankees run in the third, and Yamamoto\u2019s day was done with two outs in the fourth inning.\n\nYamamoto threw 96 pitches to get just 11 outs. It was a season-low for innings and strikeouts (two) and a season-high for hits allowed (seven).\n\nThe Yankees added two runs in the fifth against the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen on two-strike RBI singles by D.J. LeMahieu and Oswald Peraza. LeMahieu drove in another run with fourth hit of the game, an RBI double in the ninth.\n\nWhen things finally sped up for the Dodgers in the seventh inning, Pages hit a 97-mph fastball from Yankees reliever Jonathan Loaisiga for a solo home run and Max Muncy did the same thing to an 89.3 mph changeup two batters later.\n\nAfter going 105 plate appearances into the season without a home run, Muncy has seven in his past 109, including three in the past two games.", "summary": "The left-hander stifles his former team in a 7-3 win, leaving the Dodgers' top four hitters without a hit as the Yankees salvage finale after allowing 26 runs in first two games.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/01/ryan-yarbrough-silences-dodgers-as-yankees-avoid-sweep/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LDN-L-DODGERS-0602-KB15.jpg?w=1024&h=945", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 02:56:13", "author": "Bill Plunkett", "authors": ["Bill Plunkett"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.024}, {"id": 327157382, "title": "Ryan Yarbrough, Yankees shut down Dodgers to avoid sweep", "text": "Ben Rice hit a two-run home run and left-hander Ryan Yarbrough went six strong innings against his former club as the visiting New York Yankees avoided a three-game sweep in a World Series rematch with a 7-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday.\n\nDJ LeMahieu had four hits and drove in a pair of runs as the Yankees finished a 6-3 road trip against the Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Angels and Dodgers.

There is a sense of community and belonging with your surroundings. You may find yourself and others more willing to open themselves up to share ideas and small talk.\n\nThe Moon represents hidden or emotional needs, it reflects your instincts. With the Moon in Virgo, you and everyone around you may be striving for perfectionism and purification. Coupled with an extraordinary impulse to be right, conflicts may arise. Try not to be too hard on yourself in the process. Superfluous relationships or emotions shall be put aside during this time. Your focus will be on the practical and efficient use of resources.\n\nLove and Relationships\n\nWhile Mercury is in the Seventh House, you will communicate your want of stability and security in your relationships. Aries, physically and emotionally you are in a state of flux. You may be feeling sensitive or overstimulated, taking a step back and isolating can help calm the chaos. You may feel it best to purge unwanted energy into a creative outlet or business project.\n\nFamily and Home\n\nPlanetary energies flow together as the Moon is Trine Jupiter. Aries, your self-expression and self-awareness will be heightened. You will experience an uplift in your attitude and outlook on life. Dwelling on the past may cause you to be moody or more sensitive. It is good to relax and be comfortable but not at the risk of causing tension among others.\n\nCareer and Finances\n\nPlanetary energies are polarized as Pluto is Square Jupiter. Be aware, Aries, as outside influences stimulate your choices and perspective. Transforming your philosophy or feelings on spirituality may feel like a top priority. Aries, you are likely to delve into a new research project, whether for work or study, and you may be fully immersed. Travel and educational plans are a valid possibility. Integration shall prove to be your only great challenge during this transit.\n\nYou will need to ask yourself if being right is worth the result today, Aries. You are focused and feeling positive about your circumstances. Others may bring you problems or conflicts to help solve or navigate. It would be best if you did not physically get involved; giving insight or guidance may prove beneficial. Avoid starting drama or conflicts today, your natural fire may start a bigger storm.", "summary": "As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries tend to be trailblazers.

The Burbank, California, company eliminated an even larger share of employees in April 2023, when it cut 7,000 positions as it underwent a \"significant transformation,\" CEO Bob Iger said at the time.Disney owns a bevy of companies across entertainment and media, including ESPN, ABC Entertainment, ABC News, Marvel, Disney+ and Hulu.Disney shares were down 0.4% Monday afternoon following the layoff announcement.The downsizing comes less than a month after the company reported $23.6 billion in revenue in Q2, a 7% increase from the same period the year prior. \"Overall, we remain optimistic about the direction of the company and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year,\" Igor said in a statement following the earnings report.", "summary": "Walt Disney Co. confirmed it is laying off several hundred employees as part of a cost-cutting measure.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/disney-layoffs-hundreds-of-employees/", "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/02/204d84d0-2ed4-46f6-8f51-ae08a709aa0f/thumbnail/1200x630/b23658881e3aad14396ca4989e68f60a/gettyimages-1877126579.jpg?v=56a3e14bdf9c98ad3b2e8fa3a2dc5f66", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 19:30:40", "author": "Mary Cunningham", "authors": ["Mary Cunningham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.046}, {"id": 327429008, "title": "Disney is laying off hundreds of employees", "text": "The magic might be wearing thin at Disney (DIS) \u2014 for employees, at least.

Reportedly, entire teams won\u2019t be eliminated; the exact number of employees affected hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\n\nThis is the latest scene in a broader restructuring plotline. Iger announced plans in 2023 to slash 7,000 jobs and cut $5.5 billion in costs, positioning Disney for a leaner, more digital-forward future.\n\nSince then, Disney has been chipping away at its headcount with increasing frequency. Nearly 200 employees were cut in March across ABC News and Disney\u2019s entertainment networks. In October 2024, about 75 jobs were eliminated during a restructuring that folded ABC Signature into 20th Television. A few months earlier, in July, another 140 jobs were cut, hitting National Geographic, Freeform, and local TV stations. Back in September 2023, Disney let go of about 300 corporate staff across HR, legal, and finance.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s headcount remains large: As of September 2024, Disney employed 233,000 people globally, up from 225,000 a year before.\n\nFinancially, Disney\u2019s doing better than the headlines suggest. \n\nThe company just beat Wall Street expectations in a stronger-than-expected quarter, thanks to its experiences and sports divisions and its streaming business posting a $336 million profit. Iger told investors in May that earnings per share are projected to rise 16% this fiscal year, with double-digit increases in operating income for entertainment and sports and high single-digit gains for parks and consumer products.\n\nThat strong showing was enough to boost Disney stock around 21% in the period following the earnings report.\n\nIger has also made the case for job creation, particularly in Disney\u2019s \u201cexperiences\u201d segment.

I hope your week is off to a great start.\n\nStarting today, I\u2019m going to switch things up a little bit here. I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while and today\u2019s the day to make the change. No need to worry though!\n\nI\u2019m adding an extra set of hints, with one word for each group. I think it makes the most sense to slot this set of hints between the first bunch (which is often a little more cryptic) and revealing the official description for each category. There\u2019s another little change I\u2019m making, but\u2026 we\u2019ll get to that.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things go. I\u2019d appreciate your feedback on this either on Discord (more on that in a moment) or via email at [my first name @ my full name dot net]. I\u2019m just trying to make this column as useful as I can for you all!\n\nBefore we begin, we have a great little community on Discord, where we chat about NYT Connections, the rest of the NYT games and all kinds of other stuff. Everyone who has joined has been lovely. It\u2019s a fun hangout spot, and you\u2019re more than welcome to hang out with us.\n\nDiscord is also the best way to give me any feedback about the column, especially on the rare (or not-so-rare) occasions that I mess something up. I don\u2019t look at the comments or Twitter much.

You get a new puzzle at midnight every day. You can play on the NYT\u2019s website or Games app.\n\nYou\u2019re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.\n\nThere\u2019s only one solution for each puzzle, and you\u2019ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.\n\nEach group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.\n\nSelect four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you\u2019re incorrect, you\u2019ll lose a life. If you\u2019re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you\u2019re one word away from getting it right, but you\u2019ll still need to figure out which one to swap.\n\nIf you make four mistakes, it\u2019s game over. Let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you\u2019re really struggling, today\u2019s Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it\u2019s easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.\n\nIf you have an NYT All Access or Games subscription, you can access the publication\u2019s Connections archive. This includes every previous game of Connections, so you can go back and play any of those that you have missed.\n\nAside from the first 60 games or so, you should be able to find our hints Google if you need them! Just click here and add the date of the game for which you need clues or the answers to the search query.\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Hints?\n\nScroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today\u2019s Connections groups, I\u2019ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.\n\nToday\u2019s 16 words are...\n\nAnd the hints for today\u2019s Connections groups are:\n\nYellow group \u2014 be full of one\u2019s self, perhaps\n\nGreen group \u2014 ehhhh, you know, not so bad\n\nBlue group \u2014 slap and link would fit in here\n\nPurple group \u2014 you might want to give these a test run before you leap in\n\nOne Word For Each Connections Group\n\nNeed some extra help?\n\nBe warned: we\u2019re starting to get into spoiler territory.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at one word for each group.\n\nToday\u2019s Connections word hints are\u2026\n\nYellow group \u2014 POSTURE\n\nGreen group \u2014 FINE\n\nBlue group \u2014 TENNIS\n\nPurple group \u2014 MEDICINE\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Groups?\n\nToday\u2019s Connections groups are...\n\nYellow group \u2014 be ostentatious\n\nGreen group \u2014 copacetic\n\nBlue group \u2014 kinds of bracelets\n\nPurple group \u2014 things you can practice\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Answers?\n\nSpoiler alert! Don\u2019t scroll any further down the page until you\u2019re ready to find out today\u2019s Connections answers.\n\nThis is your final warning!\n\nToday\u2019s Connections answers are...\n\nYellow group \u2014 be ostentatious (GRANDSTAND, POSTURE, SHOWBOAT, SWAGGER)\n\nGreen group \u2014 copacetic (FINE, HUNKY-DORY, OK, SWELL)\n\nBlue group \u2014 kinds of bracelets (CHARM, FRIENDSHIP, ID, TENNIS)\n\nPurple group \u2014 things you can practice (LAW, MEDICINE, SELF-CARE, WITCHCRAFT)\n\nSince I was so close to my 100th win in a row at this point, it seems like a good time to move my little streak tracker and emoji result thing to after the walkthrough of my thought process. I know some of you were hoping for me to reach that 100-win streak and, well, we'll see what happened as part of that journey today.\n\nMy first attempt was with a group of SHOWBOAT, POSTURE, CHARM and SWAGGER. I was one away from a group there. I swapped out POSTURE for GRANDSTAND and was still one away! Uh oh.\n\nI eventually realized that CHARM was the odd one out and ditched that for POSTURE. That finally got me the yellows.\n\nI made a silly mistake with the next group by accidentally including SELF-CARE with the greens instead of HUNKY-DORY (SWELL doesn't really git with those, since it's more of a positive state than \"just fine\" in my book). Now I was really in trouble. A 97-game streak on the line. The nerves were rattling.\n\nThankfully, I was able to spot the purples on the smaller grid and I was able to exhale. I didn't get the connection for the blues (I don't think I'd heard of a TENNIS bracelet before). Did not care one bit about not recognizing the connection at that point.\n\nThat meant I had a 98th win in the books. No perfect game obviously. I'm just happy to keep this thing rolling. For the record, here's how I fared:\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it for today\u2019s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog tomorrow for hints and the solution for Wednesday\u2019s game if you need them.\n\nP.S.

In a new trailer for the horror sequel, from filmmaker Scott Derrickson, Ethan Hawke\u2018s serial killer the Grabber seems to have been resurrected. \n\n In the trailer, The Black Phone star Mason Thames returns as Finney, who is now in high school. Although he survived his abduction by the Grabber thanks to help of ghosts at the other end of a mysterious phone, his nemesis has returned. \u201cYou of all people should know that dead is just a word,\u201d the Grabber tells Finney in the clip. \n\n Black Phone 2 stars Hawke, Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, and Miguel Mora. It was written by C. Robert Cargill and Derrickson (the original was based on a short story by Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King). Derrickson told The Hollywood Reporter that the film switches up the idea of ghosts. \n\n \u201cThe first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is typical, a ghost story,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this one, you\u2019ve got a ghost that is a villain.\u201d \n\n He added, \u201cA middle school coming-of-age horror movie is a different animal than a high school coming-of-age horror film. There\u2019s a ratcheting up of intensity because of that. \u2026 It is certainly more violent, scarier, more graphic. And part of that is because of the age of the kids.\u201d\n\n The Black Phone was released in 2022. Rolling Stone noted in a review of the film, \u201cHawke brings a certain spooky nonchalance to the role, conveying the mundanity of evil through the uninflected naturalism of his delivery. But he\u2019s playing a rather low-concept psychopath, too lethargic to develop much of a gimmick or even the impression of a fearsomely fucked-up pathology.\u201d", "summary": "The sequel, directed by Scott Derrickson, is a follow-up to 2022 horror film The Black Phone", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/ethan-hawke-black-phone-2-trailer-1235352299/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Black-Phone.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 07:50:18", "author": "Emily Zemler", "authors": ["Emily Zemler"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.263}, {"id": 327331562, "title": "Ethan Hawke and His Terrifying Mask Return from the Dead in Eerie \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d Trailer", "text": "Ethan Hawke is bringing his terrifying horror villain back to the big screen.\n\n Universal Pictures has released the trailer for Black Phone 2, the sequel to 2021's horror hit The Black Phone from writer-director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill. The new movie is set four years after the events of The Black Phone, in which lead character Finn (Mason Thames) is kidnapped by Hawke's The Grabber and ultimately communicates with the serial killer's past victims in order to escape.\n\n According to an official synopsis for the movie, The Grabber now \"seeks vengeance on Finn from beyond the grave\" by menacing Finn\u2019s younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw.)\n\n \"As Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, the headstrong 15-year-old Gwen begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake,\" the synopsis reads. \"Determined to solve the mystery and end the torment for both her and her brother, Gwen persuades Finn to visit the camp during a winter storm.\"\n\n Per the synopsis, Gwen \"uncovers a shattering intersection between The Grabber and her own family\u2019s history\" when she and Finn visit the camp. \"Together, she and Finn must confront a killer who has grown more powerful in death and more significant to them than either could imagine.\"\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The Black Phone became a box office hit upon its 2021 release, with several critics praising its thrilling tone and the rare villainous turn from Hawke, 54. \n\n \"I've always had this theory that when you teach an audience how to see the demon inside you, they don't unsee it for the rest of your career. Jack Nicholson can be playing an accountant and you're still waiting for him to explode like he did in The Shining,\" Hawke said in an Entertainment Weekly interview at the time. \"But I realized I'm on the other side of 50 and it's time to put a new tool in the tool kit.

These lawyers were only hired to protect from the barrage of falsehoods and clarify truths.\u201d\n\nThe selection reportedly packs an extra punch given that Brooklyn\u2019s parents, David and Victoria Beckham, \u201cfell out with Meghan and Harry after they accused them of leaking stories.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Mail, Brooklyn and Peltz felt they had no other choice but to take \u201crather drastic action.\u201d \n\nIronically, Afia represented Markle, 43, in her privacy and copyright infringement case against the Mail\u2019s publishers.\n\nWith the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s permission, Afia also appeared on the BBC documentary \u201cThe Princes and the Press\u201d to deny claims that her client began \u201cbullying\u201d staff members after marrying Harry, 40.\n\nNotably, Brooklyn and Peltz joined Meghan and Harry at a dinner party in Montecito, Calif. \u2014 where the renegade royals live \u2014 last month.\n\nThe \u201cintimate gathering\u201d was held at the home of Meghan and Harry\u2019s close friends, Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins and his wife, Tracy Robbins, People reported at the time.\n\n\u201cBrooklyn and Nicola were invited prior to David\u2019s numerous global birthday galas, so the timing is pure coincidence,\u201d a source told the outlet, adding that Brooklyn and Peltz were not personally invited by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHowever, we were told that the couple \u201cfound Harry and Meghan to be particularly kind, caring and generous.\u201d\n\nTension among the Beckhams first made headlines in April when it was reported that Brooklyn and his brother Romeo Beckham were not on speaking terms over the latter dating one of the former\u2019s exes: Kim Turnbull.\n\nWhile Romeo, 22, and Turnbull have been present for recent family events, including David\u2019s lavish 50th birthday parties, Brooklyn and Peltz have been MIA.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, another member of the brood, 20-year-old Cruz Beckham, has publicly mocked Peltz and posted a cryptic message urging someone \u2014 or someones \u2014 to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\n\nThe conflict goes beyond the sibling rivalry, however, as there is longstanding tension between Peltz and her mother-in-law.\n\nPeople recently reported that Victoria, 51, made her daughter-in-law cry during her April 2022 wedding to Brooklyn after hijacking the newlyweds\u2019 special dance.\n\nVictoria was allegedly upset with Peltz for choosing not to wear one of her wedding dress designs.\n\n\u201cIt was deeply hurtful,\u201d a source told Page Six of the dance debacle. \u201cUnfortunately, this wasn\u2019t a one-off. It\u2019s a pattern that still happens to this day.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to TMZ, Victoria and David don\u2019t appreciate how Peltz \u201calways talks back to them and stands up for Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nAs for Brooklyn, he has made it clear that he will \u201calways choose\u201d his spouse.", "summary": "Beckham and Peltz have retained Jenny Afia to help them with their \"reputation management,\" as a source told us that they are \"fed up.\"", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2025/06/02/celebrity-news/brooklyn-beckham-nicola-peltz-hire-meghan-markle-prince-harrys-lawyer/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/brooklyn-beckham-nicola-peltz-hire-prince-harry-lawyer.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/frno4pha-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2025-06-02 17:37:51", "author": "Bernie Zilio,Sara Nathan", "authors": ["Bernie Zilio", "Sara Nathan"], "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.042}]}, {"news": [{"id": 327153094, "title": "NYT Strands hints, answers for June 2", "text": "If you're reading this, you're looking for a little help playing Strands, the New York Times' elevated word-search game.Strands requires the player to perform a twist on the classic word search.

McKinney claimed that a modeling company executive set up a meeting for her to \"discuss a potential business opportunity\" with Weinstein at the PM lounge one evening, on the pretense that meeting Weinstein would allow McKinney to \"make it big,\" according to the complaint.

She claimed in the lawsuit that during the meeting, Weinstein \"repeatedly told them that he wanted to get to know both of them better.\" He allegedly asked to go somewhere quieter as the lounge was too loud, and the women agreed to \"go to his place to discuss potential acting roles.\" After arriving at Weinstein's hotel room via his chauffeur, McKinney claimed the former Miramax honcho \"plied the women with alcohol, ordering them bottles of Boulevardier and Dom Perignon, several gimlets for Plaintiff, and vodka cocktails for Jane,\" the complaint stated.

Weinstein demanded that the women strip and take a bath with him.\" McKinney claimed that Weinstein then \"exposed himself to the women before entering the tub,\" and then commanded the women to join him in the tub. \"Plaintiff and Jane complied with his request, as they felt backed into a corner and feared that he would retaliate against them if they refused his sexual advances,\" the complaint stated. Weinstein then allegedly \"directed the women to engage in same-sex sexual conduct with each other.\" He then allegedly \"grotesquely watched, taking perverse joy from forcing the women to engage in sexual acts with each other.\" LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

In May 2024, McKinney filed a lawsuit against Diddy in a Manhattan federal court. She claimed that the powerhouse producer \"plied Plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\" After the meal, Combs allegedly asked McKinney to meet him at his studio on 44th Street, and she felt \"reassured that she would be with others at the studio rather alone in a personal residence.\" Upon arriving, she found Combs with several other men passing around \"a bottle of Hennesy and joints.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER \"One of Combs' associates asked her, \u2018Do you smoke weed?\u2019 to which she responded affirmatively,\" the documents stated. \"Combs' associate replied: \u2018You\u2019ve never had weed like this before.'\" The complaint stated that \"Plaintiff later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" McKinney said she felt \"pressured\" to imbibe by Combs, who told her that she was \"acting too uptight.\" \"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the suit stated. \"In the bathroom, Combs forced himself on Plaintiff and began kissing her without her consent.\" He allegedly forced McKinney to \"perform oral sex on him.\" McKinney allegedly \"lost consciousness\" and awoke in shock to find herself in a taxicab.

The operation destroyed or heavily damaged nearly a third of Moscow\u2019s strategic bomber fleet, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nRussia on Sunday fired the biggest number of drones \u2014 472 \u2014 at Ukraine since its full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine\u2019s air force said, in an apparent effort to overwhelm air defenses. That was part of a recently escalating campaign of strikes in civilian areas of Ukraine.\n\nHopes not high for the peace talks\n\nIn the aftermath of those strikes, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan chaired the peace talks at Istanbul\u2019s Ciragan Palace, a residence dating from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe talks aim to discuss both sides\u2019 ceasefire terms, he said, adding that \u201cthe whole world\u2019s eyes are focused on the contacts and discussions you will have here.\u201d\n\nU.S.-led efforts to push the two sides into accepting a ceasefire have so far failed. Ukraine accepted that step, but the Kremlin effectively rejected it.\n\nThe Ukrainian delegation was led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, while Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, headed the Kremlin team.\n\nThe Russian and Ukrainian delegations, each numbering more than a dozen people, sat at a U-shaped table across from each other with Turkish officials between them. Many of the Ukrainians wore military fatigues.\n\nRecent comments by senior officials in both countries indicate they remain far apart on the key conditions for stopping the war.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said Sunday that \u201cRussia is attempting to delay negotiations and prolong the war in order to make additional battlefield gains.\u201d\n\nThe relentless fighting has frustrated U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of bringing about a quick end to the war. A week ago, he expressed impatience with Putin as Moscow pounded Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles for a third straight night. Trump said on social media that Putin \u201chas gone absolutely CRAZY!\u201d\n\nA round of renewed direct talks, held May 16, also in Istanbul, ended after less than two hours. While both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, there was no breakthrough.\n\nUkraine upbeat after strikes on air bases\n\nUkraine was triumphant after targeting the distant Russian air bases. The official Russian response was muted, with the attack getting little coverage on state-controlled television. Russia-1 TV channel on Sunday evening spent a little over a minute on it with a brief Defense Ministry statement read out before images shifted to Russian drone strikes on Ukrainian positions.\n\nZelenskyy said the setbacks for the Kremlin would help force it to the negotiating table, even as its pursues a summer offensive on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cRussia must feel what its losses mean. That is what will push it toward diplomacy,\u201d he said Monday in Vilnius, Lithuania, meeting with leaders from the Nordic nations and countries on NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nUkraine has occasionally struck air bases hosting Russia\u2019s nuclear capable strategic bombers since early in the war, prompting Moscow to redeploy most of them to the regions farther from the front line.\n\nBecause Sunday\u2019s drones were launched from trucks close to the bases in five Russian regions, military defenses had virtually no time to prepare for them.\n\nMany Russian military bloggers chided the military for its failure to build protective shields for the bombers despite previous attacks, but the large size of the planes makes that challenging.\n\nThe attacks were \u201ca big blow to Russian strategic airpower\u201d and exposed significant vulnerabilities in Moscow\u2019s military capabilities, said Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nEdward Lucas, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis, called it \u201cthe most audacious attack of the war\u201d and \u201ca military and strategic game-changer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBattered, beleaguered, tired, and outnumbered, Ukrainians have, at minimal cost, in complete secrecy, and over vast distances, destroyed or damaged dozens, perhaps more, of Russia\u2019s strategic bombers,\u201d he said.\n\nFront-line fighting and shelling grinds on\n\nZelenskyy said that \u201cif the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently, urgently needed\u201d against Russia.\n\nInternational concerns about the war\u2019s consequences, as well as trade tensions, drove Asian share prices lower Monday while oil prices surged.\n\nFierce fighting has continued along the roughly 620-mile front line, and both sides have hit each other\u2019s territory with deep strikes.\n\nRussian forces shelled Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region, killing three people and injuring 19 others, including two children, regional officials said Monday.\n\nAlso, a missile strike and shelling around the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, killing five people and injured nine others, officials said.\n\nRussian air defenses downed 162 Ukrainian drones over eight Russian regions overnight, as well as over the Crimean Peninsula, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Monday. Moscow illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014,Crimea,\n\nUkrainian air defenses damaged 52 out of 80 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Ukrainian air force said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Suzan Frazer in Ankara, Turkey; Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed.", "summary": "Delegations met in Turkey for a second round of direct peace talks in just over two weeks.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/02/ukraine-russia-hold-talks-istanbul/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Turkey_Russia_Ukraine_War_99991.jpg?w=1024&h=768", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 12:55:02", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.036}]}, {"news": [{"id": 327173078, "title": "7 top new shows this week on Netflix, Apple TV and more (June 2-8)", "text": "Skip to main content\n\nTom's Guide\n\nTom's Guide \n\nSearch Tom's Guide\n\nView Profile\n\nNewsletters\n\nBest Picks \n\nEntertainment\n\nSwitch 2 Pre-Orders\n\nBest laptops\nBest Mattress\n\nWordle Today\n\nRecommended reading\n\n6 top new shows this week on Netflix, HBO Max and more (May 19-25)\n\n6 top new shows this week on Netflix, Hulu and more (May 26-June 1)\n\n5 top new TV shows to stream this week on Netflix, HBO and more (March 24-30)\n\n8 top new TV shows to stream this week on Netflix, Max and more (April 7-13)\n\n9 top new TV shows to stream this week on Netflix, Prime Video and more (April 28-May 4)\n\n5 top new TV shows to stream this week on Netflix, Hulu and more (March 17-23)\n\n7 top new TV shows to stream this week on Netflix, Apple TV and more (March 24-30)\n\nEntertainment\n\n7 top new shows this week on Netflix, Apple TV and more (June 2-8)\n\n2 June 2025\n\nNew TV this week includes the finales of 'Ginny and Georgia,' 'Resident Alien' and 'Stick'\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Before we get to the main event, live action thriller Predator: Badlands which will be getting a theatrical release in November, we have this animated movie to look forward to on Hulu. Predator: Killer of Killers is an anthology film that features three tales of plucky (and unlucky) humans facing off against the galaxy's greatest hunter.\nEach story is set in a different part of human history. One story takes place in Viking times, another follows a ninja in feudal Japan, while a World War II-set tale pits a pilot against an airborne Predator. Created in secret and only recently revealed, the whole thing looks like a lot of violent fun, with slick animation and lashings of gore.\nKeep track of the most exciting upcoming movies in 2025 and beyond.\nThe Survivors\n\n(Image credit: Netflix \u00a9 2025)\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nThis new Australian mystery series follows Charlie Vickers' Kieran Elliott, a traumatized man returning to his home town of Evelyn Bay, 15 years after a storm claimed the lives of three people he knew. Reconnecting with his community, however, stirs up some painful emotions and, when a woman is murdered, Elliott starts to think there's a connection to the previous tragedy.\nBased on Jane Harper's 2020 novel of the same name (and with Harper herself serving as an executive producer) The Survivors is a tense and atmospheric thriller. \"This town has a history of overlooking dead girls,\" says a character at one point, but secrets will soon be exposed as the shocking truth is finally brought to light. Get embroiled in the mystery when this new limited series comes to Netflix on Friday.\nCheck out our guide to the best Netflix shows to watch right now.\nThe Survivors\n\n \u00a35.99at Amazon\n \u00a39.19at Amazon\n \u00a311.20at Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Apple TV Plus)\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Apple TV Plus\nThis new sports comedy has all the makings of the next Ted Lasso. Owen Wilson stars as Pryce Cahill, a legendary pro golfer who suffered a very public breakdown that ended his career. A new shot at redemption comes, however, when he meets Peter Dager's Santi Wheeler, a young golfing prodigy who Cahill takes under his wing and tries to offer a shot at the big time.\nYou don't have to be a golf aficionado to appreciate the warmth of this feel good comedy. Wilson is as charming as ever, and Stick allows him to flex his dramatic muscles too. Support for Pryce comes in the form of Marc Maron's Mitts, a blunt caddy who ends up as Cahill's friend.\nWhy not browse our list of the best Apple TV Plus shows.\nThe Alto Knights\n\n(Image credit: Warner Bros.)\nAvailable: US\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\nYou get double the De Niro in Barry Levinson's latest gangster thriller. The legendary actor plays both Vito Genovese and Frank Costello here \u2013 two real life mob bosses whose initial friendship and unlikely alliance eventually soured and became a bitter rivalry. Based on a script by Nicholas Pileggi, who has major credibility when it comes to this sort of thing having written Goodfellas, The Alto Knights is a gripping portrait of the mafia and of a friendship gone very wrong. De Niro is as excellent as you'd expect, even when acting against himself, though there is certainly a slight uncanny valley feeling in those scenes.\nThe Alto Knights did not perform well when it was released in theaters, which is a shame as it's a very solid movie. Perhaps it will find a more welcoming home on streaming. We'll find out for sure when it lands on HBO Max this Friday.\nThe list of the best HBO Max movies is packed with classics.\n\n(Image credit: Sundance Institute)\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Hulu\nYou're unlikely to have seen a ghost story quite like Presence before. Steven Soderbergh's haunted house movie tells the story of a family moving into a recently renovated home only to detect a disturbing supernatural force. The difference is that Presence is told entirely from the ghost's point of view. We watch the family settle in and slowly start to understand that these people were all haunted in a different way long before they moved in.\nStarring Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Eddy Maday, and Callina Liang, Presence is a fascinating, melancholy, but also touching film about mortality. Eerie and unsettling, rather than outright terrifying, it manages to do something new with one of the oldest genres in storytelling.\nFind something to watch with our list of the best Hulu movies.\n\n \u00a3278.97at Amazon\nGinny & Georgia season 3\n\n(Image credit: Amanda Matlovich/Netflix)\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nWe're back in Wellsbury, Massachusetts, for the third series of this delightfully OTT comedy drama. The show follows 30-something Georgia (Brianne Howey) and her teen daughter Ginny (Antonia Gentry). Georgia is a resourceful mom who means well \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 but she does have one rather bad habit: she keeps killing people. In season one she murdered her abusive second husband, and in season 3 she killed Cynthia's husband in a misguided attempt to \"look after\" her friend.\nSeason 3 picks up with Georgia under house arrest and potentially facing prison time. But while this naturally puts pressure on her daughter, Antonia Gentry says that her character will grow over the course of the season, telling Netflix \"we see a new side of Ginny where she's really coming into her own, and accepting her decisions and standing by them, and making hard choices, but not being riddled with guilt or shame.\"\n\nLooking for something else to watch?

Days later, the duo spent Valentine\u2019s Day together.\n\nIn May, Cardi B and Diggs made their first public appearance at an NBA playoff game between the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe pair\u2019s new romance comes as the rapper is in the midst of a messy divorce battle from Migos alum Offset, with whom she shares three young children.\n\nIn the latest development, the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d hitmaker claimed that Offset has only seen their youngest child, 8-month-old Blossom, a handful of times since the baby\u2019s arrival in September.\n\n\u201c[Offset] has seen Blossom only like five times,\u201d Cardi claimed during a space conversation on X.\n\n\u201cI said you can see my kids in my house,\u201d she added. \u201cI want my daughter to feel the love of her dad.

Cardi is cupping her new man\u2019s face in her hands as the pair appear to be a moment away from a kiss. \n\n Though she didn\u2019t confirm that the gift came from Diggs, Cardi also shared an impressive video of a room packed tight with massive bouquets of roses and oversized teddy bears. Cardi posed for another pic, cradling one of the impressive displays in her arms while wearing a \u201cMama\u201d hat. \n\n The pair also got a little racy in one video where Cardi appears to be giving the NFL star a lap dance as he smacks her bare butt. \n\n \u201cChapter 5 \u2026\u2026Hello Chapter six,\u201d Cardi captioned the post. \n\n Rapper Da Brat commented on Cardi\u2019s post, writing, \u201cCardi I looove this HAPPY ON YOU!!!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u201d and singer Kehlani wrote, \u201cthat\u2019s my girl.\u201d\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n While this is the first time Cardi has featured Diggs on her Instagram, it\u2019s certainly not the first time the two have been spotted together. They were first seen in New York City and Miami in February 2025, per TMZ.\n\n On May 12, the pair made a public appearance sitting courtside at a New York Knicks game. They were spotted holding hands as they entered Madison Square Garden and spent the evening cozied up in courtside seats.\n\n The apparent budding romance comes amidst Cardi's ongoing drama with her ex Offset.\n\n Cardi filed for divorce from Offset in July 2024. The former couple share kids Kulture, 6, Wave 3, and Blossom, 8 months. There has been plenty of tension between the estranged pair in recent months. Days ago, Cardi claimed her ex has only seen their youngest child \u201cfive times\u201d since her birth during an X Spaces session on May 30. \n\n She added a very pointed message to Offset, saying, \"I want you to die, but I want you to die f------ slow, n----,\" she added. \"When you die, n----, I want you to die slow in the bed.

First Light.\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: IO Interactive)\n\nIO Interactive has announced the name of its upcoming James Bond game, and says we'll get out first look at it this week. The title is 007 First Light which certainly sounds like an origin story, and the studio has previously made clear this is what to expect.\n\nThe announcement post also adds a tagline: \"Earn The Number in 007 First Light, a new game by IO Interactive. Mission brief is headed your way soon.\" And it's accompanied by an image which shows the first silhouette of IO's new Bond, who's holding what looks like a Walther PPK and wearing what looks a bit like a bomber jacket: I may be wrong about the coat, but it's certainly not the dinner jacket some might expect.\nThe game also has a new website, though there's not much more to be gleaned on there other than a straightforward description: \"007 First Light is a brand new James Bond video game developed and published by IO Interactive. Featuring a wholly original Bond origin story, players will step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status.\"\n\nYou may like\n\nMindsEye: All the key details on the new action game from one of the minds behind Grand Theft Auto\n\nThe new game from former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies is coming in June, and boy it sure looks like a Rockstar game\n\nWe called its first cyberpunk setting 'cooler than Night City,' and now the studio behind The Ascent says it's making 'the kind of game that every developer wants to work on'\n\nThe Daniel Craig vibes here are unmistakeable and, if Casino Royale is anything to go by, \"earn the number\" means you kill a grand total of two people in this game. I jest of course but in that film it sets out that the \"00\" part means Bond has a license to kill, which he earns by assassinating two goons, while the \"7\" is just how M16 differentiate agents (we've met various others over the years, and who could forget 006 Alex Trevelyan).\n\nIO CEO Hakan Abrak has previously spoken a little about the game and what players might expect. \"What's exciting about [007] is that we actually got to do an original story,\" says Abrak. \"So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's a completely [new] beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future.\"\n\nIO Interactive Bond Game (Project 007) - Teaser Trailer - YouTube\n\nAbrak says IO's Bond is \"built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there \u2026 to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with.\"\nThe \"family\" Abrak is referring to is the Broccolis, who produced all the Bond films and controlled the rights to the character until Amazon MGM bought the whole thing earlier this year. It seems doubtful this will have any impact on IO's project, though it does mean this game could well be considered the final Broccoli-approved take on Bond.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nThe announcement says we'll see the game this week: that almost certainly means a big reveal at this Friday's Summer Game Fest.

The sixth-seeded Russian showcased her dominance with a straight-sets victory over Daria Kasatkina, avenging a painful loss in their previous encounter at the 2024 Ningbo final.\n\nAndreeva\u2019s 6-3 7-5 win on Court Suzanne Lenglen was a testament to her mental resilience, as she saved a set point in the second set and rallied from 5-3 down to close out the match in one hour and 34 minutes.\n\nA Season of Growth and Clay-Court Mastery\n\nAndreeva\u2019s 2025 campaign has been nothing short of spectacular. She arrived in Paris fresh off winning back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, becoming the youngest player to achieve such a feat. Her clay-court prowess has been particularly striking, boasting a 12-3 record on the surface this season, including semifinal runs in Madrid and Rome. This momentum carried into Roland Garros, where she has yet to drop a set\u2014or even concede more than five games in any set\u2014en route to the quarterfinals.\n\nTactical Brilliance and Historical Milestones\n\nAndreeva\u2019s fourth-round clash against Kasatkina was a masterclass in adaptability. Known for their frequent practice sessions, the match was as much a mental battle as a physical one. \u201cI hate playing against her,\u201d Andreeva joked afterward. \u201cEven practice is torture for me.\u201d Despite Kasatkina\u2019s crafty game and a late surge in the second set, Andreeva\u2019s ability to stay calm under pressure and trust her aggressive baseline play proved decisive. The victory made her the youngest player to reach back-to-back French Open quarterfinals since Martina Hingis in 1997 and 1998.\n\nEarlier in the tournament, Andreeva displayed her tactical versatility in a third-round win over Yulia Putintseva, where she won nine of the last ten games to secure a 6-3, 6-1 victory. The match was a fascinating duel of drop shots and court craft, with Andreeva outmaneuvering the experienced Kazakhstani. \u201cI knew Yulia would be tricky,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to fight for every ball and chase down those drop shots.\u201d\n\nLooking Ahead: A Potential Semifinal Berth\n\nAndreeva\u2019s next challenge is a quarterfinal showdown against either Jessica Pegula or French wildcard Lois Boisson. With both Aryna Sabalenka and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in the opposite half of the draw, Andreeva has a clear path to potentially surpass her 2024 semifinal finish.

I\u2019m not concerned about Stefon in that regard.\u201d\n\nDespite Diggs\u2019 potential as a dynamic No. 1 receiving target for Drake Maye in 2025, the former All-Pro might already be on shaky ground with Mike Vrabel and New England\u2019s coaching staff weeks ahead of training camp. \n\nThe viral video featured Diggs on a boat with several women in swimsuits \u2014 with the wide receiver at one point possessing a pouch that contained an unidentified pink substance.\n\nLast week, Vrabel did not go into detail over the video and if there were any disciplinary measures doled out against Diggs. \n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re aware of. Obviously, we want to make great decisions on and off the field,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that with our time here on the field today, that when we don\u2019t have a script and we\u2019re on the call periods, that we\u2019re making great decisions.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, 98.5 The Sports Hub\u2019s Scott Zolak shared that the Patriots were at least considering releasing Diggs following this misstep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the boat,\u201d Zolak said. \u201cThere are some other things that I\u2019ve heard that put some things in question. Are you all-in here?\u201d\n\nAmid this controversy, Diggs was back with his teammates on Monday \u2014 although he remains limited as he works his way back from an ACL tear he suffered in October 2024. \n\nEven though Diggs was not taking part in 11-on-11 drills, he did reel in a few catches from Maye during Monday\u2019s session. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s working hard,\u201d Patriots wide receivers coach Todd Downing said of Diggs ahead of Monday\u2019s practice. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little carryover with the stuff he did in Buffalo with (Brian) Daboll back in the day. So there\u2019s a little bit of a refresher course. But yeah, he\u2019s been working hard.\u201d", "summary": "\"He's here today, and we're excited to have an opportunity today to work with the guys who are out here and available to us.\"\n\n\nThe post Amid boat video controversy, Stefon Diggs returns to Patriots OTA practices appeared first on Boston.com.", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2025/06/02/stefon-diggs-new-england-patriots-nfl-football-boat-video-viral/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/YNHVOKSII7IFT7Z6ZQGSI22S24-683e02490f8e2-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-02 20:12:40", "author": "Conor Ryan", "authors": ["Conor Ryan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.098}]}, {"news": [{"id": 327231702, "title": "NYT Connections Sports Edition today: Hints and answers for June 2, 2025", "text": "Connections: Sports Edition is a new version of the popular New York Times word game that seeks to test the knowledge of sports fans.

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.\nIt's playable for free via the NYT Games site on desktop or mobile.\n\nNYT Connections\n\nContributor\n\nJohnny is a freelance pop culture journalist who has been writing about the internet, music, football and famous people since the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye.

The Hitman developer's penchant for creating stealthy, surprising, and emergent gameplay moments makes it the logical choice to create a new 007 game, something that's been a long time coming. Well, this week you'll finally get to see the studio's highly anticipated Project 007, which now has an official title: 007 First Light.\n\nFor the most part, James Bond games of yesteryear aligned themselves with whatever major film release was dropping at the time, or attempted to recreate iconic moments from the movies. Some are still hailed today as essential, must-play games \u2013 others are remembered for being totally awful. What's shocking, though, is that it has been well over a decade since a new experience as the world's most famous spy arrived \u2013 2012's mediocre 007 Legends was his last videogame outing. IO Interactive will soon be changing that, however, with 007 First Light. Previously referred to simply as Project 007, all that was known about it was that it would be a \"wholly original Bond story\" where players \"would earn their 00 status in the very first James Bond origin story.\"\n\nThat's a tempting proposition, and IOI's glowing reputation thanks to the superb Hitman series nudges 007 First Light even higher up my personal list of most-anticipated new PC games. After months of sneaking in the shadows, it'll soon be time to see what IOI has cooked up.\n\nA post on the newly created 007 First Light X account, shared by IOI, says that a \"mission brief is headed your way soon,\" and the accompanying graphic confirms that the full game reveal will arrive \"this week.\" With the Summer Game Fest showcase airing on Friday, June 6, there's a very high likelihood that this is when we'll get to see 007 First Light.\n\nI'll caveat this excitement by saying that nowhere does it mention there will be any proper gameplay snippets \u2013 this could well be a stylized reveal trailer or a montage of cinematics and cutscenes. Regardless, it's great to see this game, which has been pretty much silent since it was first announced all the way back in 2020, is finally ready to get shown off. Hopefully this also means the 007 First Light release date isn't too far away either.\n\nFor more, check out our list of the biggest upcoming PC games that may well get some air time this week as well.

We know it's a James Bond origin story and is a wholly original piece of work rather than retreading the events of any particular film. More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said he hopes this will be the start of a new trilogy of games, though unfortunately the studio's beloved Hitman franchise is on hiatus while IOI works on this game.
