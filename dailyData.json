It showcases more gameplay with the Revenant, the eighth and final Nightfarer to be revealed, set to the tune of \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d by Evanescence. Yes, seriously. Check it out below.\n\nOne of the Revenant\u2019s abilities involves raising her downed allies, which could very well be her Ultimate Art (and is the entire reason for the song).

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware)\n\nElden Ring Nightreign is FromSoft's experiment to see how players tolerate a Soulslike's worth of punishment when it's packed into a repeatable roguelike format, and the experiment is almost ready to commence. On Thursday, May 29, squads of nightfarers will be unleashed for co-op boss killing, and you'll need to know exactly when Nightreign unlocks if you want to be among the first to fight FromSoft bosses old and new.\n\nI can't help you with those boss fights, but I can tell you when you can get started. I've mapped out the Nightreign launch times below, so you can know the precise moment you'll be able to start hunting down Nightlords.\nI can't be blamed for what happens afterwards, though.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\n\nI personally believe that one of the reasons the world is the way it is today is due to the absence of one of the most crucial parts of 2000s culture \u2013 the AMV. Memories of every single anime series known to man being overlaid with the crunchiest 2000s buttrock tracks still permeate through my mind, and fancams just can't live up to the emotions felt when watching Vegeta go Super Saiyan for the first time to the dulcet tones of Last Resort by Papa Roach.\n\nClearly, someone at Bandai Namco (who publishes almost every anime game, so they know) feels the same, as in celebration of the launch of FromSoftware's new multiplayer title Elden Ring Nightreign, the publisher has created its own AMV trailer for the new game. The video \u2013 posted to Twitter \u2013 features a big battle between a trio of heroes and Morgott the Omen King scored with the 2003 classic Bring Me to Life by Evanescence.\nAs far as AMV's go, it's pretty peak. The battle with Morgott has its stakes heightened by the impeccable song, only for one of our heroes to fall in battle. Which in-turn allows the peak of any trailer in 2025 to happen, as one player revives their fallen teammate just as the \"WAKE ME UP\" hits in the song. And in that moment, I decided that maybe I am actually interested in getting Elden Ring Nightreign (this is not me trying to be funny, I'm actually ordering it now).\n\nYou may like\n\n\"My true love in games is The Legend Of Zelda,\" says Evanescence's Amy Lee, but making the new track for Devil May Cry was a joy: \"I was hooked on it and binging it every night\"\n\nElden Ring: Nightreign release live coverage - everything we've discovered in the run-up to launch\n\nNew Devil May Cry trailer reveals surprise twist for Netflix show and gives Dante a nu metal soundtrack\n\n2025 has marked a surprising resurgence of buttrock, with the recent Devil May Cry anime series on Netflix being packed full of it. The opening credits theme is Limp Bizkit's 2000 magnum opus Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle), the soundtrack also features Last Resort by Papa Roach and Butterfly by Crazy Town (which isn't buttrock, but gets honorary status). It even brought us a brand-new song by Evanescence, titled 'Afterlife,' which goes pretty hard. All we need now is Death Stranding 2 to feature a Creed song and the 2000s are officially back. \n\nWhile you're at it, you should check out our Elden Ring Nightreign review.\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nSee more Xbox Series X News\n\nBandai Namco\n\nXbox Series X\n\nPlayStation\n\nScott McCrae\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nContributor\n\nScott has been freelancing for over two years across a number of different gaming publications, first appearing on GamesRadar+ in 2024.

So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.\"\n\nSo if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives.

This is standard operating procedure for troublesome PC games on Steam, but Bandai brought it up in the patch notes, so I'm bringing it up here.\nA potentially bigger issue lies in the game's graphical performance.\n\"We have confirmed that some PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops,\" the patch notes say. \"We are currently investigating the cause. In the meantime, If you experience significant frame rate drops, you may be able to resolve it by setting the graphics settings from the default 'High' to 'Medium' or 'Low' and lowering the screen resolution, as well as installing the latest drivers for your graphics card.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nHopefully they'll have that sorted quickly: Elden Ring is a very pretty game and I would expect no less from Nightreign, so having to dial back the eye candy just to get it running smoothly would not make me particularly happy.\n\nElden Ring Ranni quest: Follow the witch\nElden Ring Blaidd quest: Wolf man watch\nElden Ring Nepheli quest: Warrior woman\nElden Ring Fia quest: Cold comfort\nElden Ring volcano manor quest: Get Mt.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware / Bandai Namco)\n\nJunya Ishizaki is, understandably, a little nervous. After working at FromSoftware as a combat and level designer since the original Dark Souls, he's made his directorial debut with Elden Ring Nightreign, an off-the-walls spinoff of the studio's open-world masterwork, distilled and almost kitbashed into a session-based, three-player boss gauntlet. It's a weird one \u2013 about as quick-and-dirty as game development gets at this level \u2013 but exciting. \"Personally,\" Ishizaki tells me over a Zoom call from Japan (via interpreter), \"I feel confident about this game that we've made.\"\n\nWhen I speak with him ahead of launch, Ishizaki seems contemplative. I ask him to walk me through the very beginnings of this game, which he's been thinking about since development on Dark Souls 3. Elden Ring, in all its hugeness, gave him the foothold he needed. He never thought he'd be the one directing it, let alone that FromSoftware boss and Souls maestro Hidetaka Miyazaki would specifically push for him to take the reins.\nA new challenge\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\n\"To have that opportunity finally presented to me, I was frankly very excited, and I couldn't believe that this opportunity had finally come,\" he says. \"So it was extremely exciting, but at the same time, of course, you feel, wow, is this really happening? Is this really something I'm going to do? Is this really something I can do? So again, mixed portions of excitement and nerves, but I'm extremely honored and happy to have been given that chance.\"\n\nYou may like\n\nThe director of Elden Ring Nightreign has been thinking about this game since Dark Souls 3, and \"seeing the scope of Elden Ring\" finally made it click in his mind\n\nElden Ring Nightreign leads say FromSoftware is bracing servers for launch and working to \"improve our multiplayer game\" \u2013 \"In the worst case, we want players to be able to keep playing\"\n\nElden Ring Nightreign: Everything we know so far\n\nIshizaki says he'd love to direct again, especially now that he's gotten more of a feel for the role. At the start, he thought he might have \"full control\" over everything as director. He soon realized yet again that \"games these days are way too big in scope, and it quickly became important to me to suppress my own emotions and ego and take input from all sorts of parts of the team and project.\" He reflects on the \"fork in the road\" of the game's pacey three-day structure, which prompted \"some concerns\" within the studio at first, and it seems he's also been feeling out how to find what a game \"wants to be.\"\n\n\"From conception to finding the idea of what the game wants to be and what I feel it should be, there are a lot of difficulties, and there's a lot of points you have to overcome in order to accept that,\" he says. \"You have to go into these things being prepared to explain your ideas to the team and to sort of overcome these difficulties. But during that process, there come these moments where you find something that just feels pure fun, and you just have to try to lock into that. It's an ongoing process that occurs every day.\n\"Every day you try to find something new and something fun to lock into, something that's giving you that idea and that motivation to keep going. So this is kind of how I feel the process went with Nightreign, and we'll see how it pans out for a future project.\"\nMore multiplayer\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\nFromSoftware, it seems, has locked onto something new. Nightreign gained new meaning after the reveal of The Duskbloods, the studio's Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE title due in 2026. Another multiplayer-focused game, so soon? Some fans, who are specifically here after the studio's string of single-player triumphs, were perplexed or concerned.\n\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nIshizaki, an outspoken fan of multiplayer, reiterates what Miyazaki said previously: FromSoftware isn't changing its DNA by dabbling more in multiplayer. Nightreign is an extension of the studio's design philosophy, not a rejection of it.\n\"Of course, I can't personally speak to what FromSoftware as a company might make in the future,\" he begins, \"but in terms of the types of experiences we're all aiming to create, we're always looking to make something valuable in our games, something that feels worthwhile to play, that you come away from it and feel satisfied like that was a good use of your time. And I think that's the crux of what makes our titles and what we keep in mind with everything we develop.\n\nI am sure there's still many things that we're looking to challenge and experiment withJunya Ishizaki\n\"We've had these two titles, Nightreign and the recently announced Duskbloods, with multiplayer at their core. But that's not necessarily to say that we are leaning in that specific direction going forward. I think this is simply a result of ideas and interests taking shape in the company across various departments and various titles. I think there's a little bit of serendipity involved there. But personally, I feel that multiplayer is a very interesting aspect to explore, and I think users will find that both these titles are very different and something else to enjoy along with our back catalog.\"\nDespite reusing many assets, even Nightreign is meaningfully different. It treats Elden Ring \"as a base,\" Ishizaki reckons, but you don't need to play the original game before diving in here. \"We feel that the gameplay is a key part of Nightreign that differentiates it from Elden Ring, as well as our other previous Soulslike titles,\" he says. \"If you're familiar with Elden Ring, you might have some preconceptions going in and some ideas of what to expect, but it's ultimately a very different experience, and we're excited for new players to jump in and make this their first FromSoft game.\"\nWhat's next \n\n(Image credit: FromSoftware / Bandai Namco)\nEspecially after the sky-high success of Elden Ring, which just recently topped 30 million copies sold, there was a reasonable expectation that FromSoftware would double down. It felt like the capstone of Souls games, and clearly this kind of game can soar. Surely there are more coming. And there are, surely, more coming; Nightreign and The Duskbloods just come first. Ishizaki says \"I am sure there's still many things that we're looking to challenge and experiment with in future. So we look forward to the continued support and blessings of players and media alike.\"\n\"This is a condensed RPG,\" Ishizaki concludes. \"There's a short time span in which a lot of exhilarating and dramatic events can happen. We wanted this to be the focus of Nightreign, to create these dramatic and dynamic play sessions, and to have all of these emotions and these peaks and troughs occur during any one single session. This was a challenge for us to make in this short time span, as well. But we hope that users will appreciate this new challenge and appreciate this new game flow with Nightreign. We're really looking forward to it.\"\nOur Elden Ring Nightreign review arrived alongside dozens of others calling it a well-executed idea held back by a punishing solo experience. The scores are pretty good across the board. Nightreign has settled as the lowest-rated FromSoft game in several years, but that ain't bad for an experimental project competing with some of the most acclaimed games in the industry.\nAfter playing an early build of Nightreign, I'm personally excited for launch today, May 29. (Our Elden Ring Nightreign live coverage has all the unfurling details in one place.) Assuming the servers hold \u2013 Ishizaki laughs out loud when I ask about plans for worst-case scenarios, but says they've prepped all they can for the launch rush \u2013 the multiplayer buff, the peerless fun multiplier of playing with friends, could bump this game up a notch provided you've got buddies to spare. There's always matchmaking if you don't. And FromSoftware has largely made the same type of game for over a decade, so I'm thrilled to see it step outside the box a little, even if the box is still comfortably in The Lands Between.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign release time \u2013 FromSoftware's new co-op roguelike is almost here.\n\nSee more Xbox Series X Features\n\nXbox Series X\n\nPlayStation\n\nAustin Wood\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nSenior writer\n\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

In the 2023-2024 school year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States.\n\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\u201d Rubio wrote.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday night.\n\nThe action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China. House Republicans this month pressed Duke University to cut its ties with a Chinese university, saying it allowed Chinese students to gain access to federally funded research at Duke.\n\nLast year, House Republicans issued a report warning that hundreds of millions of dollars in defense funding was going to research partnerships linked to the Chinese government, providing \u201cback-door access to the very foreign adversary nation whose aggression these capabilities are necessary to protect against.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security raised similar issues in a letter barring international students at Harvard University last week. Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of \u201ccoordinating with the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d citing research collaborations with Chinese scholars. It also accused Harvard of training members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a Chinese paramilitary group.\n\nThe announcement came a day after Rubio halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for international students as the department prepares guidelines for increased vetting of their activity on social media.\n\nThe crackdown on visas adds to uncertainty for international students\n\nTogether, the announcements from the State Department added to uncertainty for America\u2019s international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested and tried to deport students who had been involved in campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war. And the Trump administration abruptly terminated the legal status of thousands of international students before reversing itself and then expanding the grounds on which students can lose permission to study in the U.S.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin student Vladyslav Plyaka was planning to visit Poland to see his mother and renew his visa, but he doesn\u2019t know when that will be possible now that visa appointments are suspended. He also doesn\u2019t feel safe leaving the U.S. even when appointments resume.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have enough trust in the system at this point,\u201d said Plyaka, who came to the U.S. from Ukraine as an exchange student in high school and stayed for college. \u201cI understand it probably is done for security measures, but I would probably just finish my education for the next two or three years and then come back to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration last week moved to block Harvard University from enrolling any international students, a decision that has been put on hold by a federal judge, pending a lawsuit.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that Harvard, whose current student population is made up of more than a quarter of international students, should limit that percentage to about 15%.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure the foreign students are people that can love our country,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nThe action on Chinese students renews a priority from Trump\u2019s first administration to clamp down on academic ties between the United States and China, which Republicans have called a threat to national security. In April, Trump ordered the Education Department to ramp up enforcement of a federal rule requiring colleges to disclose information about funding from foreign sources.\n\nDuring his first term, the Education Department opened 19 investigations into foreign funding at U.S. universities and found that they underreported money flowing from China, Russia and other countries described as foreign adversaries.\n\nHours before Rubio announced the change, Eastern Michigan University announced it was ending engineering partnerships with two Chinese universities, responding to Republican pressure. Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, recently urged Eastern Michigan and other universities to end partnerships with Chinese universities.\n\nAround 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid. Often, they pay full price.\n\nNortheastern University, which has more than 20,000 international students, has set up \u201ccontingency plans\u201d for those who hit visa delays, said spokesperson Renata Nyul, without elaborating.\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic situation, and we are closely monitoring the developments in real time to assess any potential impacts,\u201d she said.\n\nThe US plans more in-depth reviews of visa applicants\u2019 social media\n\nIn his announcement on China, Rubio said the government also will \u201crevise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nVisa applicants have been required to provide social media handles to the State Department since 2019. The cable Tuesday did not indicate what kind of additional scrutiny the new guidelines would cover, but suggested the new reviews may be more resource-intensive.\n\nThe additional vetting will deter students from coming to the U.S., said Jonathan Friedman of PEN America, a literary and free expression organization.\n\n\u201cThe details remain vague, but this policy risks upending the long-standing place of the U.S. as a beacon for intellectual and cultural exchange with the world,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nThe move to cut off international enrollment at Harvard stems from a dispute with the Department of Homeland Security, which has demanded that it provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. Harvard says it complied with the records request, but the agency said its response fell short.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said more scrutiny of Harvard\u2019s students is necessary.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking people from areas of the world that are very radicalized, and we don\u2019t want them making trouble in our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration has cut over $2.6 billion in federal grants for Harvard as it presses demands for changes to policies and governance at the Ivy League school, which the president has described as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. Harvard has pushed back and filed a lawsuit against the administration.\n\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim in Washington and Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco contributed to this report.", "summary": "In his announcement on China, Rubio said the government also will \"revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/28/rubio-says-us-will-begin-revoking-visas-of-chinese-students/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sjm-riations_229506955.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 01:50:09", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.218}, {"id": 325952806, "title": "Marco Rubio Announces New Plan to Revoke Chinese Student Visas", "text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new plan on Wednesday to \"aggressively revoke\" student visas issued to international students from China.Newsweek reached out to the State Department via email and online form for additional comment.Why It MattersThe Trump administration has cracked down on Ivy League institutions and sought to revoke the student visas of several international students since Trump took office.Among other things, President Donald Trump and other officials have accused Harvard University and Columbia University of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus grounds amid student demonstrations protesting Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Trump's administration also tried to pull approval for Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which allows the university to enroll international students. A judge later halted the administration's efforts.The administration has also temporarily paused all new student and exchange visitor visa interviews at U.S. consulates and embassies. Amid the pause, the White House is considering implementing a new policy that would require foreign student visa applicants to go through a social media vetting.What To KnowIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Rubio said, \"The U.S. will begin revoking visas of Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\"Rubio added in a separate press release that the State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security in its efforts.The secretary of state continued, \"We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"This is a developing story that will be updated with additional information.", "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department will work in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/marco-rubio-china-student-visas-state-department-2078280", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2653135/marco-rubio.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 02:23:48", "author": "Anna Commander", "authors": ["Anna Commander"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.07}, {"id": 325958576, "title": "Rubio says U.S. will \"aggressively\" revoke visas for many Chinese students", "text": "In the latest and most drastic move yet to curtail the numbers of international students studying in the U.S. the federal government will \"aggressively\" revoke visas from Chinese students and enhance scrutiny for future applicants, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n\"Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"\n\nDepending on how broadly the State Department and Department of Homeland Security define these criteria, the edict could affect many of the 280,000 or so Chinese high school, university, and graduate level students currently in the U.S.\n\nRubio did not define what he meant by \"critical fields,\" but he likely means students working in areas like semiconductor engineer or aerospace where the U.S. and China are technological rivals. During the first Trump administration, thousands of mostly graduate-level Chinese students had their visas revoked, particularly if their research was in cutting-edge engineering fields that may have dual-use applications.\n\nThe newest move to pare back the numbers of Chinese students in the U.S. will likely further strain a bilateral relationship that has been imperiled by another trade war and serious technological competition over artificial intelligence and semiconductor chips.\n\nRevoking visas from Chinese students is also yet another blow to the American higher education system, from which the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars of funding. Some smaller, private colleges and boarding schools have come to rely financially on foreign students, who tend to pay full tuition. For decades, prestigious research universities have also been able to recruit from vast pools of talented and highly-educated students from China. \n\nEarlier this spring, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the records of about 1,800 international students, including some Chinese citizens, from a national database, a move that jeopardized their student visas and which was challenged by dozens of lawsuits nationwide. The termination of those records in what is called the SEVIS database was ultimately reversed by a federal judge, but immigration officials said they would still pursue more restrictive policies for foreign students.\n\nThis week, the State Department said in a cable it was pausing interview signups for student visa applicants in order to adequately screen their social media profiles, prompting waves of anxiety among Chinese students in the process of finalizing their student visas to the U.S. for the upcoming fall semester.\n\nChina's foreign ministry this week called on the U.S. to \"protect the legitimate rights and interests of international students, including those of Chinese students.\"\n\nFor decades, China was the biggest source of international students to the U.S., but those figures have declined steadily after tensions with the U.S. worsened and a global coronavirus pandemic temporarily closed borders. Last year, the volume of students hailing from India eclipsed China.", "summary": "The announcement to revoke visas most drastic move yet to curtail the numbers of international students studying in the U.S.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/g-s1-69495/rubio-says-u-s-will-aggressively-revoke-visas-for-many-chinese-students", "image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 02:54:56", "author": "Emily Feng", "authors": ["Emily Feng"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.044}, {"id": 325967556, "title": "U.S. to 'aggressively' revoke Chinese student visas, Secretary of State Marco Rubio says", "text": "The U.S. is poised to \"aggressively\" revoke visas issued to an unspecified number of students from China, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday. The action is expected to intensify the Trump administration's clash with universities over their international students, a chaotic showdown that has upended campus life, threatened a major stream of university income during a time of deep federal funding cuts and spilled into courtrooms across the country. Rubio said on X that the revocation will include \"those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" without elaborating on what areas of study would be targeted or whether the move would apply solely to college students. He said in a statement that the U.S. State Department and the Department of Homeland Security would \"aggressively\" revoke the visas, while also revising \"visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Hong Kong.\" The most recent data from the Institute of International Education said that more than 1.1 million foreign students \u2014 over half of whom are Chinese or Indian nationals \u2014 were in the U.S. for undergraduate, graduate or postgraduation work training programs in 2023-24. The largest share of all international students attended institutions in California, the report said. In California, Chinese students are the biggest group of international students. The 51,000 Chinese nationals in California make up more than a third of the state's nearly 141,000 foreign students. At USC alone, there were nearly 6,000 Chinese students as of fall 2024. USC, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego and UCLA drew the largest numbers of overall international students. Kevin Lu, who is from Shenzhen, China, and graduated with a finance degree from USC in December, said the statement from Rubio was \"really disappointing.\" Lu, who is working for an investment bank in Orange County, is on a visa under \"optional practical training,\" a work authorization commonly given to international student graduates to gain professional experience. \"After this news, I may postpone any international travel because once I leave the country, I might have a bigger risk of not being able to come back,\" Lu said. \"I wonder if they revoke enough student visas it will be a hit for the U.S. economy because international students are not only a source of income for universities \u2014 we pay more for tuition \u2014 but we also offer value to universities and companies.\" The announcement comes as higher education has been roiled by a litany of policy changes related to foreign students. The efforts by the Trump administration have sown fear on campuses nationwide and led some students to depart. On Tuesday, the State Department stopped scheduling visa interviews with students from foreign countries aiming to relocate their studies stateside, though it said the move was temporary. The department said it was preparing to increase the vetting of prospective international students' social media activity. Days earlier, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students. The Massachusetts institution quickly filed a lawsuit over the action and won a temporary stop to the government's ban. The fight over foreign students is increasingly playing out in the courts: Last week a California judge issued a nationwide injunction that blocked the Trump administration's efforts to end the legal status of thousands of international students while a court case challenging the terminations is pending. S. Jack Hu, who was selected as the incoming UC Riverside chancellor Wednesday and who was born in China, said he had not seen Rubio's announcement but believed the U.S. remained a \"draw for international talents.\" \"Those of us who came to study or work ... we are contributing to education and economic development and to the country,\" said Hu, who secured a visa to study engineering as a graduate student at the University of Michigan in the 1980s. \"If you look at California \u2014 many of the newer technology companies and startups \u2014 it's immigrants who contribute a lot to those new technologies and the economy of the country,\" said Hu, currently the senior vice president for academic affairs and provost at the University of Georgia.

There are more students from China studying at U.S. universities than colleges than from any other country aside from India, according to U.S. statistics.\n\nIn 2024, there were 1.1 million international students in the United States, 331,602 were Indian and 277,398 were from China. South Korea was far behind with some 43,000 students.\n\nConcern about Chinese academics stealing technology and intellectual property was a large concern for the first Trump administration, whose Justice Department had launched a controversial China Initiative program to specifically prosecute Chinese accused of corporate espionage.\n\nUnder pressure and criticism that the program was discriminatory and fueled intolerance and bias, the Biden administration ended the China Initiative in February 2022, but not to end such prosecutions, only to decouple them from a single nation.\n\nSome Republicans have wanted to bring it back.\n\nRep.

The report said 277,398 Chinese students were enrolled in the U.S. educational institutions last year, a slight decline from 2023. India overtook China on the list for the first time, with 331,602 students enrolled in 2023-24. However, China remained the leading country of origin for undergraduates and non-degree students.\n\nHas Chinese Student Enrollment In The U.s. Been Declining?\n\nAccording to the IIE report, Chinese student enrollment dropped by 4.2% in the 2023-24 academic year. This, combined with Indian student enrollment rising by 23%, meant China dropped behind its Asian neighbor as the top country of origin for international students for the first time since 2008-09. According to the IIE\u2019s annual Open Doors report, Chinese students topped the list of foreign nationals pursuing higher education in the U.S. every single year between 2010 and 2023. The number of Chinese students enrolling in U.S. universities and colleges rose steadily every year, going from 127,000 in the 2009-10 academic year to 372,532 in 2019-20. The 2019-20 academic year was the peak and the numbers began to drop with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. While overall international student enrollments trended back upwards the following year, tensions between Beijing and Washington meant Chinese students' numbers have continued to drop every single year since then.\n\nWhat Do We Know About The Economic Impact Of International Students?\n\nWhile there is no specific breakdown by country, the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers reports that international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,175 jobs in the country during the 2023-2024 academic year. The IIE\u2019s report cited the U.S. Department of Commerce and said international students contributed more than $50 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023.\n\nGot a tip?

In the 2023-2024 school year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States.\n\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\u201d Rubio wrote.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday night.\n\nThe action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China. House Republicans this month pressed Duke University to cut its ties with a Chinese university, saying it allowed Chinese students to gain access to federally funded research at Duke.\n\nLast year, House Republicans issued a report warning that hundreds of millions of dollars in defense funding was going to research partnerships linked to the Chinese government, providing \u201cback-door access to the very foreign adversary nation whose aggression these capabilities are necessary to protect against.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security raised similar issues in a letter barring international students at Harvard University last week. Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of \u201ccoordinating with the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d citing research collaborations with Chinese scholars. It also accused Harvard of training members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a Chinese paramilitary group.\n\nThe announcement came a day after Rubio halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for international students as the department prepares guidelines for increased vetting of their activity on social media.\n\nThe crackdown on visas adds to uncertainty for international students\n\nTogether, the announcements from the State Department added to uncertainty for America\u2019s international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested and tried to deport students who had been involved in campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war. And the Trump administration abruptly terminated the legal status of thousands of international students before reversing itself and then expanding the grounds on which students can lose permission to study in the U.S.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin student Vladyslav Plyaka was planning to visit Poland to see his mother and renew his visa, but he doesn\u2019t know when that will be possible now that visa appointments are suspended. He also doesn\u2019t feel safe leaving the U.S. even when appointments resume.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have enough trust in the system at this point,\u201d said Plyaka, who came to the U.S. from Ukraine as an exchange student in high school and stayed for college. \u201cI understand it probably is done for security measures, but I would probably just finish my education for the next two or three years and then come back to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration last week moved to block Harvard University from enrolling any international students, a decision that has been put on hold by a federal judge, pending a lawsuit.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that Harvard, whose current student population is made up of more than a quarter of international students, should limit that percentage to about 15%.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure the foreign students are people that can love our country,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nThe action on Chinese students renews a priority from Trump\u2019s first administration to clamp down on academic ties between the United States and China, which Republicans have called a threat to national security. In April, Trump ordered the Education Department to ramp up enforcement of a federal rule requiring colleges to disclose information about funding from foreign sources.\n\nDuring his first term, the Education Department opened 19 investigations into foreign funding at U.S. universities and found that they underreported money flowing from China, Russia and other countries described as foreign adversaries.\n\nHours before Rubio announced the change, Eastern Michigan University announced it was ending engineering partnerships with two Chinese universities, responding to Republican pressure. Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, recently urged Eastern Michigan and other universities to end partnerships with Chinese universities.\n\nAround 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid. Often, they pay full price.\n\nNortheastern University, which has more than 20,000 international students, has set up \u201ccontingency plans\u201d for those who hit visa delays, said spokesperson Renata Nyul, without elaborating.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic situation, and we are closely monitoring the developments in real time to assess any potential impacts,\u201d she said.\n\nThe US plans more in-depth reviews of visa applicants\u2019 social media\n\nIn his announcement on China, Rubio said the government also will \u201crevise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nVisa applicants have been required to provide social media handles to the State Department since 2019. The cable Tuesday did not indicate what kind of additional scrutiny the new guidelines would cover, but suggested the new reviews may be more resource-intensive.\n\nThe additional vetting will deter students from coming to the U.S., said Jonathan Friedman of PEN America, a literary and free expression organization.\n\n\u201cThe details remain vague, but this policy risks upending the long-standing place of the U.S. as a beacon for intellectual and cultural exchange with the world,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nThe move to cut off international enrollment at Harvard stems from a dispute with the Department of Homeland Security, which has demanded that it provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. Harvard says it complied with the records request, but the agency said its response fell short.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said more scrutiny of Harvard\u2019s students is necessary.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking people from areas of the world that are very radicalized, and we don\u2019t want them making trouble in our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration has cut over $2.6 billion in federal grants for Harvard as it presses demands for changes to policies and governance at the Ivy League school, which the president has described as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. Harvard has pushed back and filed a lawsuit against the administration.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

During Trump\u2019s first term, in 2019, China\u2019s Ministry of Education warned students about visa issues in the U.S., with rising rejection rates and shortening of visas. \n\nLast year, the Chinese Foreign Ministry protested that a number of Chinese students have been unfairly interrogated and sent home upon arrival at U.S. airports. \n\nChinese state media has long hyped gun violence in the U.S. and violent protests during the pandemic, and portrayed the U.S. as a dangerous place that wasn\u2019t safe for its citizens. The tense bilateral relationship has also meant that some Chinese students are opting to study in the U.K. or other countries over the U.S. after the pandemic. \n\nZou Renge, a 27-year-old public policy master\u2019s student at the University of Chicago, said she had planned to take some time off and work in humanitarian aid programs abroad after graduating at the end of this year.\n\nBut now, she will refrain from leaving the U.S. and will look for jobs in the meantime. \u201cIn a very uncertain environment, I\u2019ll try my best to find myself a solution,\u201d she said. \n\nHong Kong seeks to draw in talent amid uncertainty\n\nSome were eager to capitalize on the uncertainty facing international students in the U.S. Hong Kong\u2019s leader John Lee told lawmakers on Thursday that the city would welcome any students who have been discriminated against by American policies to study in the city.\n\n\u201cThe students who face unfair treatment can come from different countries beyond the U.S. I think this is an opportunity for Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will work with our universities to provide the best support and assistance.\u201d\n\nThat followed a widely shared post by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology inviting Harvard students to \u201ccontinue their academic pursuits\u201d there after Trump said he would revoke the university\u2019s ability to accept international students.\n\nHong Kong, a former British colony that returned to China in 1997, is a popular destination for mainland Chinese students to pursue their university degrees because of its international image and relative freedoms.\n\nThe city launched a new visa scheme in 2022 to counter the exodus of expatriates and local professionals that occurred after Beijing imposed a national security law to quell dissent and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKitty Wu, director of education consultancy Litz USA Student Service in Hong Kong, said some students who planned to apply to American universities in the future are now also considering the University of Hong Kong, the city\u2019s top university and an option because of its high ranking \u2014 something that had not happened before.\n\n\u201cThings are different every day now, we don\u2019t know how things will change in the future, so we don\u2019t know the impact for next year,\u201d she said.\n\nWill Kwong, managing director at Hong Kong\u2019s AAS Education Consultancy, said his company was helping students with offers from American universities to apply to other institutions, predominantly in Britain and Australia. \n\nU.S. was known for diversity and this will hurt it, students say\n\n\u201cHaving fewer international exchanges is definitely not good for America\u2019s development,\u201d said Zhang Qi, a postdoctoral fellow in Beijing. \u201cThis could be a positive change for China\u2019s development.

The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled President Trump had overstepped his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy in an April 2 barrage of tariffs he referred to as \"Liberation Day.\" The court also blocked a separate set of U.S. duties on China, Mexico and Canada.

The court gave the Trump administration 10 days to issue new orders canceling the tariffs. The Trump administration had cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergencies.

It had dropped roughly 20% below the mark last month, when fears were at their worst about whether Trump\u2019s trade war would drive the economy into a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.\n\nThe gains were even bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive increases in taxes on imports worldwide does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\nThe White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court\u2019s ruling also affects only some of Trump\u2019s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.\n\nTrump \u201cis still able to impose significant and wide-ranging tariffs over the longer-term through other means,\u201d according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nThat uncertainty helped dampen the excitement in financial markets as trading headed through Europe into the United States, where the gains were more modest. The U.S. court\u2019s move was nevertheless seen as a positive overall for financial markets.\n\n\u201cThe bar is raised for President Trump to resurrect his tariffs,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cMarkets are pricing that this is a better type of uncertainty than what we\u2019ve had since Liberation Day,\u201d which is when Trump announced his worldwide set of sweeping tariffs.\n\nOn Wall Street, tech stocks led the way after Nvidia once again topped analysts\u2019 expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe chip company has grown into one of the U.S. stock market\u2019s largest and most influential stocks because of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its 5.9% rise was the strongest force by far moving the S&P 500 upward.\n\nC3ai, an AI application software company, jumped 25.6% after it reported stronger profit than analysts expected for its latest quarter, while also saying the U.S. Air Force increased the top end of the range for how much its contract could be worth by $350 million to $450 million. Its total revenue grew to $108.7 million last quarter.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty was another big winner and rose 31.1% after the cosmetics company delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said it agreed to buy Hailey Bieber\u2019s Rhode skincare brand in a $1 billion deal. Rhode had $212 million in net sales in the 12 months through March.\n\nBieber, a model and the wife of singer Justin Bieber, will be Rhode\u2019s chief creative officer and head of innovation and also a strategic advisor to the combined companies.\n\nThey helped offset a drop for Best Buy, which fell even 6.3% though it reported a stronger profit than expected. Its revenue fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts.\n\nThe electronics retailer also cut its forecasted ranges for revenue and profit over the full year on the assumption that \u201ctariffs stay at the current levels for the rest of the year, and there is no material change in consumer behavior from the trends we have seen in recent quarters,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields were holding relatively steady following some mixed reports on the economy. One said that the U.S. economy likely shrunk by less in the first three months of the year than earlier estimated. Another said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.47% late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for where the Federal Reserve will take overnight interest rates, was holding at 3.96%, where it was late Wednesday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9% to help lead Asian markets higher. In South Korea, which like Japan relies heavily on exports to the United States, the Kospi also rallied 1.9%. Its market also got a boost from the Bank of Korea, which cut its key interest rate to ease pressure on the economy.\n\nThe moves in Europe were more muted. France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 0.3%, and Germany\u2019s DAX was close to flat.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "summary": "Stocks worldwide are rising after a U.S. court blocked many of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. us court of international trade,", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2025/05/29/stock-market-react-tariffs-ruling/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25147525246139.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 13:50:16", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.421}, {"id": 326154560, "title": "WATCH LIVE: White House holds press briefing after court blocks Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs", "text": "On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump didn\u2019t have the authority to impose the April 2 tariffs.\n\nCOURT BLOCKS \u2018LIBERATION DAY\u2019 TARIFFS, TRUMP APPEALS\n\n\u201cThe question in the two cases before the court is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (\u2018IEEPA\u2019) delegates these powers to the President in the form of authority to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country in the world,\u201d said the panel consisting of two Obama appointees and one Trump appointee. \u201cThe court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies quickly condemned the decision.", "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a press conference after a federal trade court struck down President Donald Trump&#8216;s sweeping tariffs.

The New York Times reports that no president has ever tried to impose tariffs under the IEEPA until now.The ruling notes that the president \"has declared several national emergencies and imposed various tariffs in response,\" as well as issuing a \"number of pauses and modifications.\" In an often-blunt ruling, the judges found that giving the president unlimited powers to impose tariffs is unconstitutional, and that Congress may not permanently delegate these powers to the executive branch. Thus, they ruled that the \"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders.\"The case was brought by dozens of states that have paid import duties since the tariffs went into effect.The three judge panel includes a judge appointed by President Trump himself, as well as judges appointed by Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, according to the Associated Press. So, what happens next?Since taking office just 129 days ago, President Trump has repeatedly been blocked by federal judges from exercising novel presidential powers. The latest setback deals a potentially lethal blow to the Liberation Day tariffs. The White House has 10 days to comply with the ruling, per The New York Times.However, that doesn't mean the Trump tariffs are dead just yet. Future tariffs, such as the recently threatened smartphone tariffs on iPhones, could be put into effect by Congress. The White House is also certain to challenge this ruling with the Supreme Court, which has already reversed several federal court rulings that blocked the president's executive orders and other actions.President Trump appointed three of the conservative judges that make up the majority block on the Supreme Court, but those same judges have sometimes frustrated the president by ruling against his wishes.Republicans in Congress are also extremely loyal to the president. They could put the Trump tariffs back into place under their own authority, in effect becoming a rubber stamp for the Trump administration.\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai in a statement reported by Axios. \"President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.\"", "summary": "In a surprise ruling on Wednesday, a U.S. Trade Court blocked President Trump from imposing tariffs under emergency powers.", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-trump-tariff-powers", "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00sAQo6ofgwYAm9Fxa853av/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1748528689.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 14:34:00", "author": "Timothy Beck Werth", "authors": ["Timothy Beck Werth"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.329}, {"id": 326201378, "title": "What Happens With Trump\u2019s Trade War Now?", "text": "The trade court\u2019s decision that Trump\u2019s entire trade war was based on powers President Trump didn\u2019t actually have is a big, big deal.

Japan\u2019s Nikkei added 1.9%.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\n\nWall Street and financial markets around the world jumped after a U.S. court ruled that President Donald Trump is not authorized to impose sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law.\n\nFutures for the S&P 500 rose 1% before the opening bell and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4%. Futures for the Nasdaq, home to Nvidia, other chipmakers and the biggest American technology companies, climbed 1.5%.\n\nU.S. Court of International Trade in New York found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump has cited as his basis for ordering massive increases in import duties, does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\nThe White House immediately appealed and it was unclear if Trump would abide by the ruling in the interim. The long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. But investors appeared to take heart after the months of turmoil brought on by Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nNvidia shares jumped 6% in off-hours trading after the chipmaker and artificial intelligence bellwether delivered another quarter of robust growth despite tariff-driven turbulence.\n\nTrump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward. Heading into its earnings announcement Wednesday, Nvidia\u2019s share price was right where it was at the beginning of 2025, before Trump took office and started his tariff rollouts.\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings, along with the court\u2019s tariff ruling, helped to propel other chipmakers and technology companies higher. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices each rose 3.1%, while Super Micro Computer jumped 4%. Apple and Amazon both rose about 2.5%.\n\nA three-judge panel ruled on several lawsuits arguing Trump exceeded his authority, casting doubt on trade policies that have jolted global financial markets, frustrated trade partners and raised uncertainty over the outlook for inflation and the global economy.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s double-digit tariff hikes \u2014 including the huge levies on China \u2014 were already paused for up to 90 days to allow time for trade negotiations. But the uncertainty they cast over global commerce has stymied businesses and left consumers wary about what lies ahead.\n\n\u201cJust when traders thought they\u2019d seen every twist in the tariff saga, the gavel dropped like a lightning bolt over the Pacific,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\nThe ruling was, at the least, \u201ca brief respite before the next thunderclap,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Europe at midday, Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 0.8%. Britain\u2019s FTSE was unchanged.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.9% to 38,432.98. American\u2019s largest ally in Asia has been appealing to Trump to cancel the tariffs he has ordered on imports from Japan and to also stop 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos.\n\nThe ruling also initially pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen, but it settled back down overnight. It was trading at 144.98 yen early Thursday, up from 144.87 yen late Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 1.3% to 23,561.86, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.7% to 3,363.45.\n\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 8,409.80.\n\nIn South Korea, which like Japan relies heavily on exports to the U.S., the Kospi surged 1.9% to 2,720.64. Shares also were helped by the Bank of Korea\u2019s decision to cut its key interest rate to 2.5% from 2.75%, to ease pressure on the economy.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Taiex edged 0.1% lower, and India\u2019s Sensex lost 0.2%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.52% early Thursday from 4.47% late Wednesday.\n\nU.S. benchmark crude oil gained 32 cents to $62.16 per barrel.

But the gains got less strong as trading progressed from Asia to New York. The S&P 500 rose 26 points, or 0.5% as of 1:03 p.m. EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 26 points, or 0.06%, the Nasdaq composite was .6% higher.\"Investors are keeping their enthusiasm in check for a variety of reasons,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a research. \"To start, the tariff drama isn't over \u2013 Trump has other legal avenues to pursue an aggressive tariff agenda, and investors expect he will utilize them. In addition, the popularity of the \"TACO Trade\" perspective has caused the tariff narrative to ease dramatically in the last couple of weeks, to the point where many people already assumed the overall burden won't be much worse than the 10% baseline when all is said and done,\" he said. Gains were bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive increases in taxes on imports worldwide does not authorize the use of tariffs. Tariff threat still \"very real\"The White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court's ruling also affects only some of Trump's tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.Trump \"is still able to impose significant and wide-ranging tariffs over the longer-term through other means,\" according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.That uncertainty helped dampen the excitement in financial markets as trading headed through Europe into the United States, where the gains were more modest. \"Yesterday's U.S. court ruling has added yet more uncertainty to the EU-US trade relationship and at face value has weakened President Trump's position. But the risk of tariffs remains very real,\" John Higgins, chief market economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.Until the appeal is resolved, there will also be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, some economists said on Thursday. The trade court's decision \"to suspend newly imposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with the universal 10% duties, \"offers potential short-term tariff relief,\" but also \"introduces greater ambiguity around the future direction of U.S. trade policy, particularly as the ruling faces appeal,\" Gregory Daco, EY chief Economist, said in a research note.On Wall Street, tech stocks led the way after Nvidia once again topped analysts' expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter.The chip company has grown into one of the U.S. stock market's largest and most influential stocks because of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its 5.9% rise was the strongest force by far moving the S&P 500 upward. C3ai, an AI application software company, jumped 25.6% after it reported stronger profit than analysts expected for its latest quarter, while also saying the U.S. Air Force increased the top end of the range for how much its contract could be worth by $350 million to $450 million. Its total revenue grew to $108.7 million last quarter. In the bond market, Treasury yields were holding relatively steady following some mixed reports on the economy. One said that the U.S. economy likely shrunk by less in the first three months of the year than earlier estimated. Another said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected.The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.47% late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for where the Federal Reserve will take overnight interest rates, was holding at 3.96%, where it was late Wednesday.The moves in Europe were more muted. France's CAC 40 rose 0.3%, and Germany's DAX was close to flat. ___AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "summary": "Gains after a court blocked President Trump's emergency tariffs got less strong, however, as trading progressed.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stocks-up-us-court-blocks-tariffs-trump-may-29-2025/", "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/22/b8706a2e-5f2e-4453-b099-3c74b0ecc874/thumbnail/1200x630/16258ce2b2a023a01f8c17da412e5c8d/gettyimages-2215901849.jpg?v=0ec0a9b0c45ecf3b0dd269ffc8f350b0", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 17:06:00", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.264}, {"id": 326220010, "title": "Trade disputes threaten US-EU relations, even as court blocks Trump tariffs", "text": "A little-known court has blocked major portions of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade agenda, but that doesn\u2019t mean his tariffs \u2013 or his efforts to extract concessions from trade partners like the European Union \u2013 are over.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that he exceeded his authority under a 1977 law to impose tariffs on other nations. Markets around the world initially surged Thursday as investors cheered the prospect that the president\u2019s aggressive trade actions would be reined in, or at least delayed.\n\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t block all of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, such as on steel and aluminum imports, but it targets some of his biggest moves. These include initial tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China due to fentanyl imports, as well as his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs of 10% or higher on all nations\u2019 imports to the United States. In both cases, the administration invoked a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which outlines conditions under which a president can declare a national emergency to take control of foreign trade, an arena usually under Congress\u2019 purview.\n\nThe IEEPA does not \u201cdelegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,\u201d the court wrote. The ruling has thrown a wrench in President Trump\u2019s continued rollout of aggressive trade actions.\n\nThe European Union is a front-burner case study of how U.S. trade policy is in flux. In the past week alone, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on European goods entering the U.S., and then pushed back his June 1 deadline to July 9 after positive talks with EU leaders over the weekend. Now, the two sides are fast-tracking talks to reach a bargain.\n\nAt stake is nearly $1 trillion worth of trade in mostly high-value goods. If a transatlantic trade war breaks out, it could prove different from, but as far-reaching as, the U.S.-China conflict, analysts say. Instead of shortages of basic goods from China, American consumers and companies could see higher prices on European pharmaceuticals, cars, specialized industrial machinery and electric goods, and parts flowing to the U.S.\n\nAnd if Europe retaliates, as it has threatened to do, the U.S. could see reduced sales of oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, aerospace goods, medical equipment, and cars flowing in the other direction. That\u2019s far more total trade in terms of value than the diminished U.S.-China trade flows.\n\nMore than money lost\n\nPerhaps the biggest long-term casualty would be political rather than economic: the loss of trust and cooperation between longtime allies.\n\nIf a trade war does break out, \u201cWe won\u2019t see it as much in the prices at Walmart or at Target,\u201d says Ryan Chahrour, a professor of economics at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \u201cIf we really put those kinds of barriers there, we could see ... a probably bigger impact in a lot of these important industries.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s pattern of big threats followed by negotiations has created uncertainty for businesses and roiled markets in the past. That may be one reason that markets initially cheered a ruling that might limit such actions in the future.\n\nBut the enthusiasm faded as some analysts pointed out that the administration retains many options to get its way on trade. It has already appealed the ruling. It could use authority other than the 1977 IEEPA to impose tariffs. Thus, Wednesday\u2019s ruling, while a setback for the administration, may add new uncertainty to the picture without changing the outcome for America\u2019s biggest trading partners.\n\nOn paper, a deal with the EU looks far more likely than one with China.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s substantive problems with the EU are less dramatic, less severe, and the EU has been more forward-leaning in offering solutions,\u201d says Scott Kennedy, a China specialist and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf the U.S. is willing to take yes for an answer, it\u2019s much more likely to resolve those differences with the EU first than with China.\u201d\n\nFor example, experts say, it should be far easier for European companies to open factories in the U.S. \u2013 a key goal of the Trump administration \u2013 than for Apple, Samsung, and other smartphone makers to relocate their assembly operations from China to the U.S. President Trump is threatening 25% tariffs on the tech giants if they don\u2019t replace low-cost Chinese labor with high-priced American workers. Europe, by contrast, already has high labor costs.\n\nBargain barriers\n\nBut there are challenges for the U.S. and EU to get to, analysts say, especially in resolving long-standing disputes between the two trading partners.\n\nOne is the U.S. negotiating position, which is to impose tariffs and then ask for something in return for lifting those tariffs, says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. That\u2019s not the kind of win-win bargaining that can lead to important breakthroughs.\n\nA related challenge is the Trump administration\u2019s negotiating style, she adds. American threats and counterthreats don\u2019t inspire cooperation.\n\nA third problem is that it\u2019s not clear what the EU can offer to satisfy President Trump. He has pushed for reform of European taxes that hurt sales of U.S. goods. But that\u2019s the purview of individual countries, not the EU. He has also targeted agriculture. For decades, Europe has resisted American demands that it reduce farm subsidies and allow imports of crops infused with genetically modified organisms into the European market. This would increase sales of American crops.\n\n\u201cLetting GMOs into Europe more broadly? That\u2019s a nonstarter,\u201d says Dr. Chahrour of Cornell. \u201cSo what can the EU give up to make the U.S. happy? It\u2019s not clear.\u201d\n\nOne deal, and it has sticky issues\n\nThe only U.S. trade deal negotiated so far, with the United Kingdom, doesn\u2019t offer much guidance. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had little economic leverage and was eager for a deal, so he acceded earlier this month to most of America\u2019s demands. That includes better access for some U.S. farm and commercial aviation goods while allowing America\u2019s 10% tariff on British goods to remain in place.\n\nBut stickier issues, such as Britain\u2019s tax on digital services and its restrictions on U.S. chicken imports, remain unresolved, wrote conservative economist and columnist Peter Morici, a former director of the Office of Economics at the U.S. International Trade Commission, in a recent column in The Washington Times. The British deal \u201cdemonstrates the limits of foreign governments\u2019 willingness to yield to tariff bullying.\u201d\n\nSome nations may have no choice but to find an agreement.\n\nWhen size matters\n\n\u201cSmaller countries are more likely to kowtow to the U.S. They don\u2019t havel any kind of negotiating power,\u201d says Dr. Lovely of the Peterson Institute.\n\n\u201cBut the EU and China are different,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re very large trading blocks. And I would imagine that while we may see something coming [in terms of a deal], it\u2019s unlikely that the U.S. will really get much from all of this.\u201d\n\nSeveral analysts believe the two sides will reach some kind of deal.\n\n\u201cAlthough there will be fits and starts and tariffs could go back up, eventually the U.S. will probably have no choice but to accept the EU offer because the alternative will be further escalation and further isolation of the United States,\u201d says Dr. Kennedy, the China specialist.\n\nThe longer-term damage may be geopolitical, says Dr. Chahrour. \u201cThe most likely scenario is one in which cooperation between the U.S. and Europe on all kinds of issues is going to be less, it\u2019s going to be harder to achieve. And there\u2019s going to be a lot of negative consequences from that loss of confidence in each other.\u201d", "summary": "As a court ruling interrupts President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans, the

after glacier collapse", "text": "GENEVA, Switzerland - A large section of the mountain village of Blatten in southern Switzerland was buried under an avalanche of ice, mud and rocks after a massive glacier gave way on Wednesday. Photos from the disaster zone showed feet of debris sliding down the mountainside, with most of the village submerged beneath the debris field. Only a few rooftops remained visible following the collapse of the Birch Glacier, which had shown signs of instability in recent weeks. Engineers had been monitoring the glacier and issued evacuation notices more than a week before the collapse, which prevented a greater tragedy. According to seismologists, the force of the avalanche was equivalent to a magnitude 3.1 earthquake. The Swiss government was closely monitoring the situation for any additional slides, which could force more additional evacuations. ANTARCTICA\u2019S \u2018DOOMSDAY GLACIER\u2019 IS MELTING AWAY DIFFERENTLY THAN SCIENTISTS FIRST THOUGHT According to Swiss government estimates, Blatten is home to a population of only around 300 people, but that figure typically swells during the busy ski season, which runs annually from December into early April. Emergency crews are actively monitoring the disaster zone for any missing people, but a government official said as of Wednesday evening there were no reported injuries from the event. \"It's terrible to lose your home. I feel for the residents of Blatten,\" Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said in a statement. The Alps are home to thousands of glaciers, but many are retreating and melting, according to a recent NASA survey. The range\u2019s largest ice sheet is known as the Great Aletsch Glacier and is located in southwestern Switzerland. According to the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network, the giant glacier has retreated by more than 4,300 feet since 1984. HOW SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THE LOSS OF ARCTIC SEA ICE WILL IMPACT US WEATHER PATTERNS Melting glaciers and the depletion of sea ice are widely considered to be major contributors to rising sea levels and shifting climates across the globe. NASA reports that Antarctica alone loses approximately 150 billion tons of ice each year, while melting in Greenland results in 270 billion tons of annual ice loss.", "summary": "A massive avalanche triggered by the collapse of the Birch Glacier buried much of the Swiss village of Blatten under ice, mud and rocks.

For the final hurdle, every correct answer from previous hurdles is shown, with correct and misplaced letters clearly shown.An important note is that the number of times a letter is highlighted from previous guesses does necessarily indicate the number of times that letter appears in the final hurdle. \n\n You May Also Like\n\n window.videoEmbeds = window.videoEmbeds || [];\n let data = [];\n data.excoPlayListId = '6824b9518c3807c48181397f';\n data.excoPlayListVideos = {\"07d6c319-40c3-40a4-b0a9-467f04b741df\":\"02vgW4yZ3xaDzu4rjqCwXQ9\",\"1e26f671-1084-4e1d-9ca7-99d7b431ab7b\":\"013pzSYUAjWENJ8FXIMBVRk\",\"32ee20d1-6aa4-4595-a30b-8afd870ac17e\":\"01QT09ckKeud3cFW8WO4GBR\",\"4c201064-3067-4195-b00f-c11211658849\":\"03EWmJo7GDHXfGokuBSVjE0\",\"576cfb40-a96d-4192-87de-45236a9e57ca\":\"01Y5solFG7EZLQLKBlAgFyd\",\"5a6fcba1-a1f6-4ad2-8f1c-b085a3be7ebb\":\"001xohZIbg2KKMDOkJaDX9E\",\"67cf2efd-521c-41a4-8d6a-f5523b705d99\":\"01erCYD4MaFYvaWpfafPBpn\",\"a2a6cfd3-36bb-4a5f-b6b3-c39188f9438c\":\"03NvhQnLuNtYL6DuVAWEENJ\",\"dc2b375d-eaa6-422f-8b3b-4c08b795c591\":\"00pJyW5aDGjGKs7zIkdhgQG\",\"f8db3946-7732-49c1-996d-7af5458c3701\":\"018qIkMuDshyNPpEWhyzKSP\"};\n data.playlistItemCallback = function (item, index) {\n if (item.title) {\n document.getElementById(\"video-title-container-6824b9518c3807c48181397f\").innerText = item.title;\n\n window.videoEmbeds.push({\n elemId: 'video-container-6824b9518c3807c48181397f',\n data: data,\n videoPlayerType: 'related-contextual',\n\nIf you find yourself stuck at any step of today's Hurdle, don't worry!

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.\nIt's playable for free via the NYT Games site on desktop or mobile.\n\nNYT Connections\n\nContributor\n\nJohnny is a freelance pop culture journalist who has been writing about the internet, music, football and famous people since the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye.

Today\u2019s NYT Strands hints, spangram and answers for Friday, May 29 are coming right up.\n\nHow To Play Strands\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Strands puzzle is a play on the classic word search. It\u2019s available on the NYT website and in the NYT Games app alongside the likes of Wordle and Connections (which we also cover in daily guides at Forbes Gaming).\n\nThere\u2019s a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you\u2019ll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links at least two sides of the board, but it may not start or end there. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow.\n\nPlay Puzzles & Games on Forbes\n\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes\u2122\n\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\n\nPinpoint By Linkedin\n\nGuess The Category\n\nQueens By Linkedin\n\nCrown Each Region\n\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\n\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\n\nEvery letter is used once in one of the theme words and spangram. You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it\u2019s possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you\u2019re playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess.\n\nIf you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you\u2019ll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words.\n\nBe warned: You\u2019ll need to be on your toes. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to fill the missing word(s) in a phrase. On other days, the game may revolve around synonyms or homophones. The difficulty will vary from day to day, and the puzzle creators will try to surprise you sometimes.\n\nWhat Is Today\u2019s Strands Hint?\n\nScroll slowly! Just after the hint for today\u2019s Strands puzzle, I\u2019ll reveal what the answer words are.\n\nThe official theme hint for today\u2019s Strands puzzle is...\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker...\n\nNeed some extra help? Here\u2019s another hint...\n\nGet in position\n\nThere are six theme words to find today, including the spangram.\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s NYT Strands Hints?\n\nSpoiler alert! Don\u2019t scroll any further down the page until you\u2019re ready to find out today\u2019s Strands hints.\n\nHere are the first two letters of every theme word in today\u2019s puzzle. They\u2019re ordered from left to right, then top to bottom by any letter of the word appearing for the first time:\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s NYT Strands Answers?\n\nBefore I reveal the other the full word list, I\u2019ll first tell you the spangram and show you where that is on the grid.\n\nThis is your final spoiler warning!\n\nToday\u2019s Strands spangram is...\n\nHere\u2019s where you\u2019ll find it on the grid\u2026\n\nNew York Times Strands screenshot, showing the highlighted term SOCCER\nNew York Times\n\nToday\u2019s Strands theme words are...\n\nHere\u2019s what the completed grid looks like...\n\nCompleted NYT Strands grid for May 30, including the words MIDFIELDER, STRIKER, GOALKEEPER, SOCCER, ... More DEFENDER and FORWARD.\nNew York Times\n\nAt first I thought the theme might have to do with journalism, as a kicker is an often-pithy final line in a story. However, a hint got me STRIKER and after that everything was very clear.\n\nI have to admit, a little piece of me dies every time I have to write the word \"soccer.\" The sport is called football. It is a game you play primarily with your feet. Players touch the ball with their feet hundreds of times in a match, as opposed to an NFL game, in which the ball is kicked maybe 10-15 times a game? This will never not annoy me (and yes, I am Scottish, why do you ask?).\n\nAnyway, I used one hint and the spangram was the second theme word I found.\n\nThat wraps up my current run of Strands coverage. See you all in two weeks!\n\nPlease follow my blog for more coverage of Strands, Connections and other word games as well as video game news, insights and analysis. It helps me out a lot!

The weekend is almost upon us, which is cause for celebration or relief for many. Maybe a little less so for those who work weekends (I see you out there).\n\nI am not a parent, but my partner is and she has primary responsibility for her little one. We have plans to move in together when the three of us are ready for that step, but in the meantime I think it\u2019s important for me and her almost-five-year-old to spend more time together and get to know each other more. Her dad\u2019s still very much in the picture (he and I get along well), but if me, my partner and her daughter do live together, I\u2019ll be helping to raise the kiddo to a certain extent.\n\nThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot lately. I want, first and foremost, to make sure I\u2019m playing a supporting role there, helping to raise the little troublemaker in line with her parents\u2019 wishes. But there\u2019s a lot I can help her discover.\n\nI mean, she\u2019s probably a little young to grasp the concept and power of compound interest or understand the reasons for geopolitical tensions between so many countries. That\u2019ll come in time. But I\u2019m looking forward to opening her mind to more art and books and music and films and games and science and so much of the other cool stuff that the world has to offer.\n\nPlay Puzzles & Games on Forbes\n\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes\u2122\n\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\n\nPinpoint By Linkedin\n\nGuess The Category\n\nQueens By Linkedin\n\nCrown Each Region\n\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\n\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\n\nBefore we begin, we have a great little community on Discord, where we chat about NYT Connections, the rest of the NYT games and all kinds of other stuff. Everyone who has joined has been lovely. It\u2019s a fun hangout spot, and you\u2019re more than welcome to hang out with us.\n\nDiscord is also the best way to give me any feedback about the column, especially on the rare (or not-so-rare) occasions that I mess something up. I don\u2019t look at the comments or Twitter much. You can also read my weekend editions of this column at my new newsletter, Pastimes.\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Connections hints and answers for Friday, May 30 are coming right up.\n\nHow To Play Connections\n\nConnections is a free, popular New York Times daily word game. You get a new puzzle at midnight every day. You can play on the NYT\u2019s website or Games app.\n\nYou\u2019re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.\n\nThere\u2019s only one solution for each puzzle, and you\u2019ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.\n\nEach group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.\n\nSelect four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you\u2019re incorrect, you\u2019ll lose a life. If you\u2019re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you\u2019re one word away from getting it right, but you\u2019ll still need to figure out which one to swap.\n\nIf you make four mistakes, it\u2019s game over. Let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you\u2019re really struggling, today\u2019s Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it\u2019s easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.\n\nIf you have an NYT All Access or Games subscription, you can access the publication\u2019s Connections archive. This includes every previous game of Connections, so you can go back and play any of those that you have missed.\n\nAside from the first 60 games or so, you should be able to find my hints via Google if you need them! Just click here and add the date of the game for which you need clues or the answers to the search query.\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Hints?\n\nScroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today\u2019s Connections groups, I\u2019ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.\n\nToday\u2019s 16 words are...\n\nWATER BOTTLE\n\nTOILET PAPER\n\nAnd the hints for today\u2019s Connections groups are:\n\nYellow group \u2014 lightning and Stewart would work here\n\nGreen group \u2014 wrap em\u2019 around\n\nBlue group \u2014 probably more likely to be seen at a corporate get-together than an Oscars party\n\nPurple group \u2014 like chicken and sugar\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Groups?\n\nNeed some extra help?\n\nBe warned: we\u2019re starting to get into spoiler territory.\n\nToday\u2019s Connections groups are...\n\nYellow group \u2014 rods\n\nGreen group \u2014 they\u2019re on a roll!\n\nBlue group \u2014 common swag items\n\nPurple group \u2014 words before \u201cshack\u201d\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Answers?\n\nSpoiler alert! Don\u2019t scroll any further down the page until you\u2019re ready to find out today\u2019s Connections answers.\n\nThis is your final warning!\n\nToday\u2019s Connections answers are...\n\nYellow group \u2014 rods (BAT, CLUB, STAFF, STICK)\n\nGreen group \u2014 they're on a roll! (FOIL, RIBBON, TAPE, TOILET PAPER)\n\nBlue group \u2014 common swag items (HAT, TEE, TOTE, WATER BOTTLE)\n\nPurple group \u2014 words before \"shack\" (CADDY, LOVE, RADIO, SHAKE)\n\nThat's a 94rd win in a row. And hey, I got the reverse rainbow! Here's how I fared:\n\nThis was the second day in a row where I found everything pretty straightforward. RADIO and SHAKE were my entry points for the purples.\n\nCaddyshack is a famous comedy film from the \u201880s, while \u201cLove Shack\u201d is a fantastic song from the same decade by The B-52\u2019s. RadioShack is an electronics retail chain in the U.S. and Shake Shack is a fast casual restaurant chain that serves tasty food.\n\nWATER BOTTLE made the blues pretty clear to me after that. At that point, the yellows seemed obvious, but I slid through the greens first (but not before figuring out the link between them).\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it for today\u2019s Connections clues and answers. I\u2019ll be back with you all here on Monday. In the meantime, you can check out my weekend editions of this column in my newsletter, Pastimes.\n\nP.S. If not for our ska punk theme week, today's song would have obviously been \"Love Shack.\" But I have to stick to my plan here.\n\nOne of the first ska punk songs that really landed for me was \"All My Best Friends Are Metalheads\" by Less Than Jake. I saw the band at a festival when I was a teenager and had a great time.\n\nI recently found a video on YouTube of a different performance from that festival that shows me fairly clearly right at the barrier (and no, I won\u2019t tell you where to find it). Zero chance you\u2019ll find me at that place at a big show these days. I\u2019m quite content to enjoy the show from afar:\n\nHave a great day! Stay hydrated! Call someone you love!\n\nPlease follow my blog for more coverage of NYT Connections and other word games, and even some video game news, insights and analysis. It helps me out a lot!

His full-time tenure would end on Friday after joining Trump in the White House for the Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nMusk posted to X, the social media platform he owns: \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"\n\nMusk told reporters earlier this week that he plans to focus more on his businesses: Tesla, SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI, which now includes X.\n\nMusk said he will keep a small office in the White House as an unofficial adviser.\n\nDuring a Tesla earnings call in April, Musk said he would spend a \"day or two per week\" on government work until the end of Trump's term in January 2029.\n\nThere are around 100 DOGE employees, including many embedded in agencies. Their status wasn't announced.\n\nMusk told reporters last week that he had worked in Washington, D.C., on his DOGE initiative \"seven days a week, or close to seven days a week\" during Trump's first 100 days in office. He frequently traveled on Air Force One with Trump to the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., and recently to the Middle East.\n\nThis has meant less attention to his companies, including publicly held Tesla, the company that makes electric vehicles, solar panels/shingles and energy storage devices.\n\n\"It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks,\" he said in an interview with Ars Technica.\n\nTesla released its first-quarter financial data on April 22.\n\nTesla's revenue was its lowest in three years: $19.3 billion total, down 9% compared with the same time last year. The company's profit was $3.15 billion, which is a 15% decline. And its earnings of 27 cents a share was a drop of 70% from 45 cents a year ago.\n\nIn the first quarter, Tesla produced more than 362,000 vehicles.\n\nOn Wednesday, pension fund leaders sent a letter to Tesla's board demanding that Musk must put in 40 hours per week, at a minimum, to attain any future CEO pay package.\n\nProtests were mounted at dealerships nationwide as people opposed Musk's program and worker cuts.\n\nHe said his efforts have been far more challenging than expected and DOGE had become \"the whipping boy for everything.\"\n\nDuring an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, Musk said \"something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it. People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That's really uncool.\"\n\nMusk originally said he would slash $2 trillion in spending but now he says $175 billion in taxpayer money has been saved but experts say that number is greatly inflated.\n\nHe also became at odds with Trump on Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package going through Congress.\n\n\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS Sunday Morning. \"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both.\"\n\nHe spoke to reporters from SpaceX headquarters in Texas before Tuesday night's Starship test flight.\n\n\"People want to have the chill vibes, and SpaceX is sort of ultra hardcore. But if we're not ultra hardcore, how are we going to get to Mars? You're not going to get to Mars in 40 hours a week,\" Musk told The Post.\n\nBesides sending astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station, SpaceX has launched 8,774 Starlink satellites from Florida and California since May 2019.\n\nStarlink is used by several federal agencies, including the State Department, Coast Guard, Interior Department and the Space Force.

The billionaire stated that he would \"significantly\" lower the amount of time he spent on DOGE in May, as well as increase his attention on Tesla. However, at the time he drew short of saying he would quit DOGE, pledging to stay for \"as long as it's useful\" and President Donald Trump wanted him to remain.It now seems though Musk believes that time has come to an end. While Trump has not yet issued a public statement regarding his departure, the news comes a day after Musk uncharacteristically criticised the president's tax bill, stating that it \"increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"Though Musk initially claimed that DOGE would cut government spending by a minimum of $2 trillion, the reality has fallen far short from this. In April he revised DOGE's goal down to $150 billion, a mere fraction of the cuts initially promised. Meanwhile, U.S. government agencies have been thrown into turmoil by DOGE's actions, with over 280,000 government workers laid off. DOGE has also worked to dismantle several agencies entirely, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a foreign aid organisation.Musk is expected to return his attention to his various companies, including Tesla, X, and SpaceX. Such companies have been publicly floundering in the past few months, struggling against severe reputational damage caused by Musk's widely unpopular political work. Tesla sales have plummeted across the globe, the electric vehicle company experiencing a 71 percent drop in profit during Q1 2025. Social media platform X isn't faring much better, losing millions of users while advertisers fled, though Musk denied reports that he told employees that they were \"barely breaking even.\" SpaceX doesn't appear to have suffered quite as much, however the explosion of its latest Starship test flight on Tuesday was less than ideal \u2014 particularly considering it was the company's third \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" in a row.Speaking to Ars Technica prior to both SpaceX's launch and the announcement he'd be leaving DOGE, Musk acknowledged that he'd been spending too much time on politics rather than running his companies.\"I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics, [though] it's less than people would think,\" said Musk. \"It's not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.\"", "summary": "Elon Musk is stepping down from his position as de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-doge-leave", "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04R7bUBXxiymyCQIm5p8Cmn/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1748499513.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 06:47:45", "author": "Amanda Yeo", "authors": ["Amanda Yeo"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.532}, {"id": 326064554, "title": "Elon Musk is leaving the Trump administration after leading effort to slash federal government", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk is leaving his government role as a top adviser to President Donald Trump after spearheading efforts to reduce and overhaul the federal bureaucracy.\n\nHis departure, announced Wednesday evening, marks the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs, the evisceration of government agencies and reams of litigation. Despite the upheaval, the billionaire entrepreneur struggled in the unfamiliar environment of Washington, and he accomplished far less than he hoped.\n\nHe dramatically reduced his target for cutting spending \u2014 from $2 trillion to $1 trillion to $150 billion \u2014 and increasingly expressed frustration about resistance to his goals. Sometimes he clashed with other top members of Trump\u2019s administration, who chafed at the newcomer\u2019s efforts to reshape their departments, and he faced fierce political blowback for his efforts.\n\nMusk\u2019s role working for Trump was always intended to be temporary, and he had recently signaled that he would be shifting his attention back to running his businesses, such as the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\nBut administration officials were often vague about when Musk would step back from his position spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, and he abruptly revealed that he was leaving in a post on X, his social media website.\n\n\u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d\n\nA White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed Musk\u2019s departure.\n\nMusk announced his decision one day after CBS released part of an interview in which he criticized the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda by saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by what the president calls his \u201cbig beautiful bill.\u201d\n\nThe legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. Musk described it as a \u201cmassive spending bill\u201d that increases the federal deficit and \u201cundermines the work\u201d of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\n\n\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d\n\nTrump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I\u2019m thrilled by other aspects of it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also suggested that more changes could be made.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a way to go.\u201d\n\nRepublicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.\n\nMusk\u2019s concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. \u201cI sympathize with Elon being discouraged,\u201d said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nSpeaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d there was enough opposition \u201cto slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious\u201d about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a \u201cvery delicate balance\u201d that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying \u201cthe House is eager and ready to act on DOGE\u2019s findings.\u201d\n\nThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE\u2019s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.\n\nMusk occasionally seemed chastened by his experience working in government.\n\n\u201cThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\u201d\n\nHe also recently said that he\u2019ll reduce his political spending, because \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d\n\nMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. After putting at least $250 million behind Trump\u2019s candidacy, he wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\n\n\u201cThe more I\u2019ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\u201d Musk said in February. \u201cFrankly, I love him.\u201d\n\nTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as \u201ca truly great American.\u201d When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if any, impact that Musk\u2019s comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate, especially given his departure from the administration. During the transition period, when his influence was on the rise, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.\n\nHis latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk\u2019s interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was \u201cstill time to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate version will be more aggressive,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt can, it must, and it will be.

Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.\n\nDavidson took note of Musk\u2019s comments on social media.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.\n\nHouse Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Sometimes he clashed with other top members of Trump's administration, who chafed at the newcomer's efforts to reshape their departments, and he faced fierce political blowback for his efforts.\n\nMusk's role working for Trump was always intended to be temporary, and he had recently signaled that he would be shifting his attention back to running his businesses, such as the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\nBut administration officials were often vague about when Musk would step back from his position spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, and he abruptly revealed that he was leaving in a post on X, his social media website.\n\n\u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d\n\nA White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed Musk's departure.\n\nMusk announced his decision one day after CBS released part of an interview in which he criticized the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda by saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by what the president calls his \u201cbig beautiful bill.\u201d\n\nThe legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. Musk described it as a \u201cmassive spending bill\u201d that increases the federal deficit and \u201cundermines the work\u201d of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\n\n\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d\n\nTrump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I\u2019m thrilled by other aspects of it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also suggested that more changes could be made.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a way to go.\u201d\n\nRepublicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.\n\nMusk's concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. \u201cI sympathize with Elon being discouraged,\u201d said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nSpeaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d there was enough opposition \u201cto slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious\u201d about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a \u201cvery delicate balance\u201d that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying \u201cthe House is eager and ready to act on DOGE\u2019s findings.\u201d\n\nThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE\u2019s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.\n\nMusk occasionally seemed chastened by his experience working in government.\n\n\u201cThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\u201d\n\nHe also recently said that he'll reduce his political spending, because \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d\n\nMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. After putting at least $250 million behind Trump's candidacy, he wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\n\n\u201cThe more I\u2019ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\u201d Musk said in February. \u201cFrankly, I love him.\u201d\n\nTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as \u201ca truly great American.\u201d When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.\n\nIt's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate, especially given his departure from the administration. During the transition period, when his influence was on the rise, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.\n\nHis latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk's interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was \u201cstill time to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate version will be more aggressive,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt can, it must, and it will be. Or it won\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\nOnly two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.\n\nDavidson took note of Musk\u2019s comments on social media.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.\n\nHouse Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade.\n\n___ Associated Press writers Scott Bauer in Milwaukee, and Kevin Freking, Lisa Mascaro and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.", "summary": "Elon Musk is leaving his government role as a top adviser to President Donald Trump after spearheading efforts to reduce and overhaul the federal bureaucracy.", "url": "https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/05/29/elon-musk-leaving-trump-administration-after-leading-effort-slash-federal-government.html", "image": "https://images01.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2025-05/ApNewsroom_APTOPIX_Trump_14139.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 13:08:33", "author": "Chris Megerian", "authors": ["Chris Megerian"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.166}, {"id": 326191710, "title": "Elon Musk leaves DOGE amid tanking Tesla sales", "text": "Elon Musk has left his role as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). \u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cThe @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d\n\nDOGE is a Trump administration initiative with the stated goals of cutting wasteful government spending, modernizing IT systems and maximizing efficiency in various departments \u2014 even though DOGE itself was initially set to have two leaders, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who dropped out to focus on a bid to become Ohio's governor. Musk\u2019s tenure there has been an eventful one, to put it mildly, as DOGE has taken a chainsaw to the government over the last four months.\n\nMusk's slash-and-burn approach (similar to the one he adopted in his early days at X) played a role in hundreds of thousands of federal workers being turfed out \u2014 reportedly including some working at an agency that regulates Tesla. DOGE officials were involved in firing workers who it turned out had essential roles and had to be quickly hired back. In some cases, federal judges ordered the reinstatement of fired federal employees.\n\nDOGE has inserted staffers into many government agencies. It demanded access to sensitive data including federal employee information and Treasury Department financial records, a request that a judge granted this week despite 19 attorneys general trying to prevent that over privacy and legal concerns.\n\nElsewhere, DOGE has been using generative AI chatbots to try to automate some government tasks. (A custom version of ChatGPT used by the Department of Veterans Affairs is called, in all seriousness, VAGPT.) The initiative also reportedly monitored government communications for criticisms of Musk and President Donald Trump. It was also reported last month that the Social Security Administration was moving all its official communications with the public to X, the social network that Musk owns.\n\nGiven his status as a Special Government Employee, Musk could only legally serve in his position for 130 days in a one-year period. The 130 days are up as of May 30, though DOGE is slated to remain operational until July 4, 2026.\n\nMusk's departure comes at a time of turmoil for some of his higher-profile companies. It emerged this week that, between April 2024 and last month, sales of new Tesla electric vehicles dropped by half in Europe. \u2014 despite EV sales in the region rising overall by 28 percent. In Quebec, said to be the most EV-friendly market in Canada, Tesla sales reportedly sank by 87 percent between the first three months of 2024 and the same period this year. Overall, Tesla deliveries dipped by 13 percent in that timeframe.\n\nTesla\u2019s business is interlocked with Musk and the public persona of its CEO. Its reputation has been damaged in the eyes of many given Musk\u2019s political dealings, personal views, his association with DOGE, the agency\u2019s actions and his efforts to help Donald Trump win the presidency.\n\nActivists have called for boycotts of Musk's companies and staged protests at Tesla showrooms. Many Tesla owners have been trying to distance themselves from Musk by placing stickers on their cars. Others have sold their EVs, even though that meant taking a financial hit amid plummeting resale values. Protestors have targeted Cybertrucks and others have made fun of the vehicle and owners of it on social media. (In fairness, that\u2019s not entirely to do with Musk\u2019s association with DOGE and the president \u2014 the Cybertruck is an absolute eyesore).\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX had mixed results with its latest Starship test flight this week. While the spacecraft reached space, the payload door got stuck and it was unable to deploy its payload of fake satellites. As for the Super Heavy booster, which had been reused after the successful seventh test flight, that was supposed to splash down into the ocean but, six minutes after launch, it experienced a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"\n\nSo Musk has plenty to concern himself with as he officially leaves DOGE, but he's been critical of a federal budget bill. As he prepared to depart his government role, he expressed \"disappointment\" with the Trump spending bill, suggesting in an interview that it \"undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\" The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which the House passed last week, will end most clean energy tax credits, including those on EV purchases. Tesla has claimed that \"abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America\u2019s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.\"\n\nIn any case, it's unclear whether DOGE has actually met its mandate of slashing government spending. A tracker on the DOGE website claims to have saved taxpayers some $170 billion by canceling contracts and laying off workers, but reports suggest that the \"Wall of Receipts\" is full of misleading or inaccurate claims. A fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute think tank suggested to CBS News this month that the figure is more likely to be around $80 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that, since Trump took office in January, federal spending has actually increased by 8.7 percent compared with the same period in 2024. That's largely due to spending on Social Security, Medicare and other social insurance programs, as well as interest payments on the federal debt. However, the report notes that the full impact of the DOGE-led cutbacks may not yet been factored into the figures, given the up-front costs involved in ending programs and canning so many workers.", "summary": "Elon Musk has left his role as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). \u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cThe @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d\n\n\nDOGE is a Trump administration initiative with the stated goals of cutting wasteful government spending, modernizing IT systems and maximizing efficiency in various departments \u2014 even though DOGE itself was initially set to have two leaders, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who dropped out to focus on a bid to become Ohio&#39;s governor.

And while it seems clear Musk has worn out his welcome with President Donald Trump, it\u2019s naive to portray the billionaire oligarch\u2019s announcement as a sign he\u2019s truly \u201cleaving\u201d the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @RealDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,\u201d Musk wrote on his social media platform X.\n\nThat tweet was followed up by reporting in the Associated Press, New York Times, and Washington Post that indicated Musk was actually departing and would have no more influence over the Trump White House. But Musk\u2019s extensive ties to the government, which existed long before DOGE came into existence, were treated as an afterthought.\n\nThe Washington Post article took 17 paragraphs before it acknowledged that \u201cMusk has numerous business ties to the federal government, including major contracts for Starlink and SpaceX.\u201d The New York Times piece on the palace intrigue didn\u2019t include any mention that Musk is a government contractor who receives billions of dollars through SpaceX.\n\nThose articles also failed to note what\u2019s perhaps the most critical fact: Musk has installed his henchmen in virtually every federal agency and has gained access to untold amounts of private and proprietary data that business rivals would kill for. Take Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old member of DOGE who goes by the name Big Balls. Coristine has been listed as an \u201cexpert\u201d at the Office of Personnel Management, according to Wired, and there are no public reports that indicate he\u2019s leaving the government along with Musk.\n\nMusk has sat down for several Fox News interviews with other DOGE members at his side, none of whom seem to be \u201cleaving\u201d government either. Luke Farritor, the 20-something DOGE bro who would reportedly \u201cveto\u201d payments for HIV/AIDS programs over the objections of top officials at USAID? No signs he\u2019s left. Marko Elez, the 25-year-old who was pushed out after being linked to extremely racist tweets, only to be quickly rehired? That guy is still on the government payroll, as far as we can tell. The list goes on.\n\nAnd who do you think these young men swear their allegiance to? The U.S. Constitution, or their hero Elon Musk? Is there any universe in which we believe that all of these DOGE plants throughout the federal government are just earnestly working on rooting out \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse\u201d rather than providing Musk with everything he could ask for at the drop of a hat?\n\nThe only person who seems to have \u201cleft\u201d the government to work on Musk\u2019s other projects was Katie Miller, the supposed spokesperson of DOGE and wife of White House advisor Stephen Miller. There\u2019s no doubt that the internal gossip about conflict between Musk and other people in the Trump regime is interesting to read. The speculation on Bluesky Wednesday night was that Musk was in a throuple with Stephen Miller and his wife Katie Miller. That stemmed from a Wired article where a longtime Republican operative said he didn\u2019t want to know anything about their social life, suggesting it was weird.\n\nThe fact that rumors about an unholy throuple are dominating the conversation tells you where our interests often lie as human beings. There are only so many news stories you can read about DOGE gutting vital scientific and public health programs or firing hundreds of thousands of workers before it feels like old news. We want to hear about the sex and the shouting matches, like when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent repeatedly yelled \u201cfuck you\u201d at Musk in a hallway of the West Wing, according to the Atlantic.\n\nMusk and DOGE have faced several lawsuits over their brazen and almost certainly illegal actions. Fourteen states sued back in February in a case that\u2019s still making its way through the courts. But those lawsuits aren\u2019t nearly as salacious as the in-fighting. There\u2019s something much more compelling to a story about two grown-ass men screaming at each other like children, for obvious reasons.\n\nWhere does that leave Musk, even assuming he really is stepping back from the White House? The billionaire has suggested repeatedly that he doesn\u2019t want to spend money on politics anymore. But it\u2019s important to remember that Musk frequently lies. Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help get Trump and other Republicans elected in 2024. This was after Musk insisted a Wall Street Journal report that he planned to spend big for Trump wasn\u2019t true.\n\nLately, the billionaire has spent an inordinate amount of time whining. Practically every interview he does these days includes a story about how he\u2019s the most put-upon man in the universe. People don\u2019t like him and are protesting his Tesla dealerships, with some people even committing vandalism and arson. Musk doesn\u2019t like to acknowledge that there\u2019s a good reason that some people might not like him. This is the guy who started Trump\u2019s second term by giving two Nazi-style salutes and waited a long damn time before even denying that\u2019s what he was doing.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball that can tell us what level of involvement Musk will have with the Trump regime in the coming days, weeks, and months. But take everything you read with a big grain of salt. There are still plenty of folks who can look at companies like Tesla and SpaceX and The Boring Company and insist Musk\u2019s renewed focus on their operations means that he\u2019s leaving politics. If Musk\u2019s tenure with DOGE has shown anything, it\u2019s that literally every company Musk runs is political.\n\nHow can something like The Boring Company\u2014the Musk venture that digs tunnels in the ground\u2014be political? Gizmodo was writing about the politics of his vision for that company before it even had a name. Back in 2013, when Musk announced his idea for Hyperloop, we pointed out the biggest hurdle for that idea would be digging tunnels. And to dig tunnels, especially from Los Angeles to San Francisco, as was imagined, requires engaging in the politics of land use, permitting, and environmental concerns. You can have the most genius technologically driven idea in the world, but actually building it requires engaging in politics.\n\nAll tech is political, whether we like it or not. And Musk knows that. So don\u2019t expect his supposed retreat from the White House to mean much in the years ahead.", "summary": "How many DOGE boys are still rooting around in the federal government?", "url": "https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-isnt-really-leaving-the-government-but-he-is-on-everyones-shit-list-2000608750", "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-donald-trump-march-9-GettyImages-2203698446-copy.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 17:13:32", "author": "Matt Novak", "authors": ["Matt Novak"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.155}, {"id": 326205712, "title": "Elon Musk's right-hand man is leaving DOGE too", "text": "Steve Davis, Elon Musk's right-hand man, is following the Tesla CEO out the DOGE door.A White House official confirmed to Business Insider that Davis, who is also a leader of Musk's Boring Company, has left the DOGE team.

The duo showcased the world as if they were the best of allies, despite Musk criticizing Donald Trump\u2019s policies before. \n\nThe pair even appeared for a joint interview on Fox News with journalist Sean Hannity. The pair talked about inflation news and Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, and Trump also repeatedly tried to establish a relationship with the father of thirteen. In return, Musk also spoke highly about the 78-year-old and believed he was a good man. \n\nAlas, people were shocked when Musk announced his step down from Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The White House said that his role was always meant to be temporary. The Tesla CEO\u2019s exit comes just a day after he openly criticized the centerpiece of Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 a sweeping budget bill.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nIn an interview with CBS, Musk expressed disappointment with the proposal, which includes multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks and significant increases in defence spending. \u201cThe big, beautiful bill,\u201d as Trump calls it, would, according to Musk, worsen the federal deficit and undermine the goals of DOGE. \n\nI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d Meanwhile, as per Tyla, Trump and Musk\u2019s friendship wasn\u2019t as smooth as it appeared on screens.

Entering Wednesday's game, they were 5-0 when he scored a goal this postseason, per Jameson Olive of the team website. \n\nSecond-period rally showcases Panthers' depth \n\nAfter the Hurricanes grabbed a 2-0 lead in the first period, the Panthers responded in the second period, taking a 3-2 lead. Three Panthers, center Anton Lundell, center Evan Rodrigues and left winger Matthew Tkachuk, scored.\n\nRodrigues' wrister was his first goal of the postseason. With his score, the Panthers became the fourth team since the start of the 1996 playoffs to have 19 goal-scorers in a postseason, via Josh Dubow of the Associated Press. \n\nFlorida's depth is one key reason it outlasted Carolina on Wednesday night and dominated the series. The Hurricanes had just five goal-scorers in five games (center Seth Jarvis, center Jordan Staal, center Logan Stankoven, right winger Jackson Blake and center Sebastian Aho).\n\nIt could also help the Panthers become the first team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions since the 2020-21 Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nWhere do the Hurricanes go from here? \n\nThe Hurricanes have made the Eastern Conference Final in two of the past three seasons but have been eliminated twice. \n\nThe Hurricanes have quality players, such as Aho and Jarvis. Aho scored four goals in five games against Florida, including two on Wednesday night. Jarvis, meanwhile, scored two goals in five games. \n\nStill, it seems they may not have enough players like Jarvis and Aho, which may be preventing them from being a viable threat to Florida. \n\nConsidering that, the Hurricanes should splurge this offseason to upgrade their roster. They're in a position to do that. Spotrac estimates they have $31.98M in cap space, the fourth-most in the NHL. Perhaps they could use it to sign Toronto Maple Leafs right winger Mitch Marner, who's scheduled to hit free agency. \n\nPanthers may be on the verge of becoming a dynasty\n\nIt's safe to say the Panthers are in one of their better eras in franchise history. From the 1995-96 season to the 2021-22 season, they won just four playoff series. Now, they've become the ninth team to make three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, per Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press. \n\nIf the Panthers win the Stanley Cup again, they'll become just the ninth team in NHL history to repeat as champions. \n\nThey still have to win four more games to do that, which could prove difficult, especially if the Oilers beat the Stars in Game 5 at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday. The Oilers' loss to the Panthers in last year's Stanley Cup may motivate them. More importantly, they have center Connor McDavid, perhaps the best player in the game. \n\nRegardless, the Panthers' run over the past three seasons is remarkable, and that's why they're on the verge of becoming one of the best teams in league history.", "summary": "On Wednesday night, the Carolina Hurricanes showcased plenty of resilience in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Final, but the Florida Panthers proved they're the far better team.", "url": "https://www.yardbarker.com/nhl/articles/carter_verhaeghes_key_goal_launches_panthers_into_third_straight_stanley_cup_final/s1_13132_42256488", "image": "https://www.yardbarker.com/media/d/c/dc7590130d7dccebcf5668c66d77c7d00a09df1c/thumb_16x9/verhaeghe-launches-panthers-third-straight.jpg?v=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 05:12:21", "author": "Clark Dalton,Yardbarker", "authors": ["Clark Dalton", "Yardbarker"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.003}, {"id": 326086226, "title": "Panthers advance to 3rd straight Stanley Cup Final", "text": "The Florida Panthers dropped Game 4 of the 2025 Eastern Conference Finals against the Carolina Hurricanes.

This is evident through their approaches to the Conference Championship trophy. The winner of the Eastern Conference is awarded the Prince of Wales Trophy. However, many teams decide not touch it, believing it could spell bad luck in the Stanley Cup Final.\nThe Panthers did touch the trophy when they defeated the Hurricanes in 2023. Unfortunately, they went on to lose the Stanley Cup Final. They elected not to touch the trophy last year. Florida almost experienced bad luck, blowing a 3-0 series lead to the Edmonton Oilers. However, they were able to win Game 7 and the Stanley Cup along with it.\nThis year, the Panthers elected to once again not touch the Prince of Wales Trophy. Whether this leads to a second consecutive championship remains to be seen. However, they do appear on course for a rematch with Edmonton.

Tkachuk managed to redirect the flight of the puck, poking his stick in the air and knocking it into the net past Hurricanes goaltender Frederik Andersen.\n\nRodrigues beat Andersen again just 30 seconds later.\n\nJones started that play by skating away from the forecheck and hitting a long pass up the right boards to Tkachuk, who corralled the puck and sent a quick feed to Rodrigues. The Panthers forward skated over the blue line before hitting a pass to Bennett on his left. Bennett proceeded to skate through the left circle before lacing a pass through defenders, finding Rodriguez in front of the net. Rodrigues finished the play with a quick wrist shot past Andersen.\n\nLundell gave the Panthers their first lead with about four minutes later. Marchand set up that score after he got the puck from behind a face off won by Lundell. He then sent a pass in front of the net from the left side of the goal line. Lundell pushed his stick above the crease to redirect the puck past Andersen.\n\nJarvis leveled the score at 3-3 with a wrist shot 8:30 into the final frame, but Verhaeghe and Bennett then put the game away for the Panthers.\n\nBarkov set up Verhaeghe's go-ahead score with a sensational play from behind the Hurricanes net.\n\nHe received an initial pass on the right flank before skating with Hurricanes defenseman Dmitry Orlov behind the goal line. He then slammed on the brakes with his left skate, deked winger Eric Robinson and slid a pass toward the far post. Verhaeghe hovered into the area and blasted a one-timer behind Andersen.\n\nBennett found the net for the last goal of the night with an empty-netter score with 53.4 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Panthers will take on the Oilers or Stars in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final will be on June 4 or 7 in Edmonton or Dallas, depending on who wins the Western Conference finals.

Only $160 billion in spending was highlighted by the fledgling agency for elimination, and the House GOP completely ignored those recommendations. Musk left his government post to focus on his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, while so-called fiscal conservatives passed a bill through the House, with the president\u2019s full support, that would spend more money than former Presidents Joe Biden or Barack Obama could ever imagine.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI think a bill can be big, or it can be beautiful, but I don\u2019t know if it can be both.\u201d\n\nIf passed in its current form, the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d would increase the annual federal deficit from roughly $1.9 trillion under Biden to $2.2 trillion, and that number could balloon to $2.6 trillion if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are renewed without offsetting costs. There is hope that the bill could be amended significantly by the Senate, but GOP members are under pressure from the administration to pass the bill. President Donald Trump has already called for a primary challenge (again) in Rep. Thomas Massie\u2019s (R-KY) district after the fiscal conservative opposed the bill\u2019s reckless spending increases.\n\nDespite the threats, some senators appear to be taking the debt and deficit seriously, at least for now. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), one of the only consistent fiscal hawks left, told Fox News Sunday, \u201cThe problem is the math doesn\u2019t add up; they\u2019re going to explode the debt.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, \u201cWe have enough [votes] to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit.\u201d\n\nTrump admitted that he expects \u201csignificant\u201d changes to be made to the spending bill in the Senate. However, it is unclear if enough senators, besides Paul, Johnson, and Massie, are willing to endure the ridicule and threats from the press and the leader of their party to fix the fiscal abomination that is Trump 2.0\u2019s first spending legislation. \n\nPolitical, rather than economic, realities will win the day. If there is no political will among Republicans in Congress to use their trifecta of power to right the fiscal ship, this bill will pass largely unmolested, to the detriment of not only ourselves but future generations. The anemic bond market is already signaling that confidence in the U.S. economy is declining due to out-of-control spending and the president\u2019s erratic trade war. Adding between $22 trillion and $26 trillion in new debt over the next decade, in our current predicament, would be insane, to put it mildly. Forget paying it off; it would become increasingly difficult to sell U.S. debt if the current trajectory continues.\n\nDespite the unfortunate nature of the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the United States is not fighting a major war, the COVID-19 pandemic is in the rearview mirror, reversing Biden\u2019s negligence seems to have fixed the crisis at the southern border in short order, and the GOP controls the White House and both houses of Congress.

Hoover, 74, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for the 1973 murder of 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer William \"Pooky\" Young, when he was convicted of federal charges in 1997, and sentenced to six life terms. Hoover was among 39 Gangster Disciples leaders indicted in August 1995 in Operation Headache, a six-year effort by the feds to infiltrate Gangster Disciples. Federal prosecutors had accused him of leading a criminal enterprise to continue overseeing the gang while in prison in Illinois. Hoover is currently serving six life sentences in a maximum security prison in Colorado, according to federal prison records. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody, but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois, dating back to 1973 for Young's murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at ADX Florence, a maximum security prison in Colorado that they described as \"the most restrictive, draconian supermax prison in the United States.\"In a statement, Hoover's attorneys, Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore, said they are \"thrilled\" to see he will be released from federal custody. \"The Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover's considerable growth and complete rehabilitation. Despite the Court's unwillingness to do the right thing, Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters. Thankfully, Mr. Hoover's pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover.\"When Hoover was up for parole by the State of Illinois in 2022, his parole was denied. An Illinois Department of Corrections order says Hoover would have to be turned over to the state to serve the remainder of his state sentence if released from federal custody. In 1993, Hoover spoke to former CBS News Chicago reporter John Davis. At the time, Hoover was 42 years old and had already served 20 years in prison.\"I've done my time,\" Hoover said in the 1993 interview. \"I paid my debt to society.\"In the interview with Davis, the leader of the Gangster Disciples and convicted murderer he'd had a lot of time to think about ways to stop the gang violence on the streets of Chicago.\"One teenager don't like the other teenager because of the way he wear his hat, because his ideology is different from his; a Disciple don't like a Vice Lord,\" Hoover said in the interview. \"We're all Black people. There's no difference.\"At that time, Hoover, also known as King Larry, admitted being part of a fragile gang truce in the city and organizing a protest over plans to close healthcare clinics in African American neighborhoods. Ron Safer, the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial, expressed disappointment in the news of Hoover's sentence being commuted. \"I was disappointed,\" Safer said. \"I do not think that this is an appropriate end to the Larry Hoover story \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least the federal part of it.\"Safer said Hoover was perhaps the most notorious criminal the state of Illinois has ever known. \"He was convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise that had approximately 30,000 members across 28 states, selling over $100 million worth of drugs in the state of Illinois alone each year,\" said Safer, \"and he ran that entire operation with ruthless efficiency from prison, where he was serving a state sentence for double murder.\"Safer also emphasized that about Hoover had been recorded saying teenagers needed to sell drugs for his criminal organization. The recording was made a year after the Gangster Disciples leader was interviewed on CBS Chicago.\"There was another tape where Larry Hoover said, 'You have to share your drugs with these children \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I'm talking about 12 years old, 13 years old, 14 years old \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so that they can sell it, and they can have something',\" Safter said, \"and he said, 'Make them know that with you, they are somebody, and without you, they are nobody.'\"Again, Safer said those comments were made by Hoover after the Gangster Disciples said he was redeemed, and said he understood that all of the violence in the city should be stopped.", "summary": "Hoover, 74, still faces the remainder of a 200-year sentence in Illinois for the 1973 murder of William \"Pooky\" Young.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/larry-hoover-gangster-disciples-sentence-commuted-president-trump/", "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/28/4e825457-d6a7-43c5-a2a7-480b65aefe37/thumbnail/1200x630/9e1339b0c7be9037645f2e8e05450e74/larry-hoover-1993-file.png?v=0ec0a9b0c45ecf3b0dd269ffc8f350b0", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3790019_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-05-29 00:16:49", "author": "Todd Feurer", "authors": ["Todd Feurer"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.014}, {"id": 325940074, "title": "Trump commutes federal life sentence of founding Gangster Disciples kingpin Larry Hoover", "text": "President Donald Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Chicago-born Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover, abruptly ending Hoover\u2019s yearslong quest to win early release under the First Step Act passed during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nThe two-page order said Hoover\u2019s sentence was considered served \u201cwith no further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions,\u201d and directed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to release him \u201cimmediately,\u201d according to a copy of the document provided by Hoover\u2019s legal team.\n\nThe controversial move \u2014 part of a slew of clemency actions announced by the White House this week \u2014 appeared to have already sparked Hoover\u2019s transfer out of the supermax prison compound in Florence, Colorado, that he\u2019d called home for the past two decades.\n\nBut Hoover isn\u2019t going free \u2014 he\u2019s still serving a 200-year sentence for his state court conviction for murder.

But thanks to the work of so many advocates and supporters keeping Mr. Hoover\u2019s voice alive and ultimately the president taking action to deliver justice, we are thrilled to see Mr. Hoover released. Now it\u2019s time for the IDOC to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAn IDOC spokesperson could not immediately be reached.\n\nOnce one of the nation\u2019s largest street gangs, the Gangster Disciples became a major criminal force under Hoover\u2019s leadership, with operations that spread to dozens of U.S. cities and were as sophisticated as many legitimate corporations, including a strict code of conduct for members and a franchise-style system for drug sales.\n\n\u201cThey had armies of lawyers and accountants. They had their own clothing line, music promotion company, political action committee. They had a structure that helped them insulate the leaders from the drugs and the guns,\u201d Ron Safer, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Hoover in the 1990s, told the Tribune in 2012.\n\nFor years, Hoover has been housed in solitary confinement at the supermax prison in Colorado, which counts a number of high-profile and notorious detainees, including Sinaloa cartel boss Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, Sept. 11 terrorist attack plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, and Jeff Fort, the Chicago gang leader who founded the El Rukns.\n\nThe Illinois Prisoner Review Board last year heard arguments for Hoover\u2019s release, but ultimately denied the request, records show. The review board won\u2019t hear his case for another four years, records show.\n\nAddressing board members last year, Hoover said he is a 73-year-old man who views the world much differently than when he went into prison, records show. A summary of his statements to the board said, \u201cHe regrets the wrong choices that he has made and the harm he has caused.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe argues that he is not a threat to the community, and that he will not do what he once did,\u201d the summary of Hoover\u2019s statement continued. \u201cHe would not make the same mistakes, and he admits today that he did make those choices in the past.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order was first reported by the news site NOTUS.\n\nReached by phone Wednesday afternoon, Hoover\u2019s sister, Diane Cooper, said, \u201cI\u2019m just happy. (Trump) did a very good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can say what they want,\u201d Cooper, 70, said. \u201cI\u2019m behind him 100%. He needs to be home. Right is right and wrong is wrong.\u201d\n\nCooper said she didn\u2019t know \u201canything\u201d about a state sentence that might keep her brother behind bars. Representatives of Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoover\u2019s son, Larry Hoover Jr., posted a photo to his Instagram account Wednesday afternoon of someone holding up Trump\u2019s signed order with the words \u201cAlmost home!!\u201d and two praying-hands emojis.\n\nFederal prosecutors have vehemently opposed any breaks for Hoover, now 74, arguing he did untold damage to communities across Chicago during his reign on the streets. They argued he has continued to hold sway over the gang\u2019s hierarchy while imprisoned, even promoting an underling he\u2019d secretly communicated with through coded messages hidden in a dictionary.\n\nHoover\u2019s attorneys, meanwhile, have claimed that decades behind bars have left him a changed man and that prosecutors have unfairly painted him as a puppet master to try to keep him locked up.\n\nAt a hearing last year, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey asked Hoover\u2019s defense attorney point-blank: \u201cHow many other murders is he responsible for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the methodology is for determining that,\u201d attorney Bonjean replied, somewhat taken aback by the unusually blunt query.\n\n\u201cSo many we can\u2019t count?\u201d Blakey shot back.\n\nAfter Bonjean said she couldn\u2019t \u201cput a number on it,\u201d Blakey went a step further and asked if Hoover himself would like to weigh in.\n\n\u201cHe probably has the most knowledge of all,\u201d the judge said.\n\nAt that hearing, which Hoover attended via a live link from prison, he told the judge he\u2019s \u201chad a chance to reflect on my life and the trouble that my existence has caused in the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in (the supermax) you\u2019re locked up at least 21 hours a day. You go away in your cell and reflect on every aspect of your life, and you see things differently,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cYou see things you\u2019re proud of and you see things that maybe you\u2019re not so proud of, and you realize that life is too short.\u201d\n\nIf he were released, Hoover said, he would counsel others how to avoid gangs, not join them.\n\n\u201cI just want to say that I would be a credible risk if you were to allow me to go back to the world,\u201d Hoover said.\n\nBlakey had not yet ruled on Hoover\u2019s motion.\n\nHoover was convicted in state court in 1973 of the murder of William Young, one of Hoover\u2019s gang underlings who was shot to death that same year after he and others had stolen from gang stash houses. He was sentenced to 200 years in prison.\n\nIn the early 1990s, before Hoover was charged in federal court, former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer lobbied the IDOC parole board on his behalf, arguing that Hoover could help stem Chicago\u2019s street violence if he were allowed to return home, the Tribune reported at the time.\n\nHoover was indicted in federal court in 1995 on charges he continued to oversee the murderous drug gang\u2019s reign of terror from prison. He was convicted on 40 criminal counts in 1997, and then-U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentenced him to the mandatory term of life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t always agree with the guidelines,\u201d Leinenweber told Hoover during that hearing. \u201cSometimes I think they are too draconian. But in this case, I agree with them 100%.\u201d\n\nBefore last year\u2019s hearing, prosecutors alleged that during a prison visit with his common-law wife in August, Hoover asked her if his lawyers wanted him to bring a copy of the \u201cBlueprint\u201d to Thursday\u2019s hearing, which the U.S. Bureau of Prisons considers \u201ca blueprint for how to organize a prison gang,\u201d including governing principles, methods of discipline and a membership application.\n\nThe motion also revealed that an email message was sent Aug. 26 by a known Gangster Disciples member to 123 fellow gang members in federal prison referring to Hoover as \u201cDad\u201d and using \u201ccoded terminology, in the form of a basketball analogy, to instruct all incarcerated GDs to stay out of trouble and temporarily suspend gang activity\u201d until Hoover gets a ruling in his case.\n\n\u201cIN SUPPORT OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, THERE WILL BE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY INCIDENTS ON THE COURT,\u201d the all-caps message read, according to the prosecution filing.\n\n\u201cThis communication is deeply concerning,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz wrote at the time. \u201cIt demonstrates the continued power high-ranking GD leaders, and specifically Larry Hoover, hold over the GDs (and) underscores the extremely high risk of recidivism and the danger to the community if Hoover is released.\u201d\n\nSchwartz also said that Hoover\u2019s life sentence was appropriate, given his place as one of the most dangerous criminals ever prosecuted in Chicago\u2019s federal court.\n\nBut Hoover\u2019s lawyers argued it\u2019s the government that has proselytized the myth of Hoover as some arch-criminal who can still command the masses \u2014 because it suits their endgame of keeping him locked up.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that many people from all walks of life, including politicians, celebrities, community activists and people who self-identify as GDs, support Hoover,\u201d Bonjean wrote in a 2022 court filing. \u201cIndeed, the fact that Mr. Hoover is supported by individuals who are not gang members is what frightens the government the most. The government does not want to see a rehabilitated Hoover. It wants to hold on to its narrative of Hoover as the most notorious dangerous, and violent man on the planet.\u201d\n\nBonjean argued in the September hearing that Hoover should be looked at as a human being, not a monster. He entered prison illiterate and has since earned his GED and taken classes on robotics, art history and the life of Abraham Lincoln, she said. A voracious reader, Hoover \u201cwould have a PhD by now if that type of programming was available to him,\u201d according to Bonjean.\n\nShe also said it\u2019s \u201crubbish\u201d to think Hoover is still commanding gang members, some of whom weren\u2019t even born when he entered prison. \u201cIf Mr. Hoover is held responsible for every criminal act by those who self-identify as a GD, well then I guess he\u2019s toast,\u201d she said.\n\njmeisner@chicagotribune.com\n\nckubzansky@chicagotribune.com\n\nscharles@chicagotribune.com", "summary": "President Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover.", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/28/trump-commutes-federal-sentence-larry-hoover/", "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-l-larry-hoover-e1748465244582.jpg?w=1024&h=577", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 00:48:15", "author": "Caroline Kubzansky,Jason Meisner,Sam Charles", "authors": ["Caroline Kubzansky", "Jason Meisner", "Sam Charles"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.068}, {"id": 325941496, "title": "Trump commutes federal life sentence of founding Gangster Disciples kingpin Larry Hoover", "text": "President Donald Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Chicago-born Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover, abruptly ending Hoover\u2019s yearslong quest to win early release under the First Step Act passed during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nThe two-page order said Hoover\u2019s sentence was considered served \u201cwith no further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions,\u201d and directed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to release him \u201cimmediately,\u201d according to a copy of the document provided by Hoover\u2019s legal team.\n\nThe controversial move \u2014 part of a slew of clemency actions announced by the White House this week \u2014 appeared to have already sparked Hoover\u2019s transfer out of the supermax prison compound in Florence, Colorado, that he\u2019d called home for the past two decades.\n\nBut Hoover isn\u2019t going free \u2014 he\u2019s still serving a 200-year sentence for his state court conviction for murder.

They had a structure that helped them insulate the leaders from the drugs and the guns,\u201d Ron Safer, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Hoover in the 1990s, told the Tribune in 2012.\n\nFor years, Hoover has been housed in solitary confinement at the supermax prison in Colorado, which counts a number of high-profile and notorious detainees, including Sinaloa cartel boss Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, Sept. 11 terrorist attack plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, and Jeff Fort, the Chicago gang leader who founded the El Rukns.\n\nThe Illinois Prisoner Review Board last year heard arguments for Hoover\u2019s release, but ultimately denied the request, records show. The review board won\u2019t hear his case for another four years, records show.\n\nAddressing board members last year, Hoover said he is a 73-year-old man who views the world much differently than when he went into prison, records show. A summary of his statements to the board said, \u201cHe regrets the wrong choices that he has made and the harm he has caused.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe argues that he is not a threat to the community, and that he will not do what he once did,\u201d the summary of Hoover\u2019s statement continued. \u201cHe would not make the same mistakes, and he admits today that he did make those choices in the past.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order was first reported by the news site NOTUS.\n\nReached by phone Wednesday afternoon, Hoover\u2019s sister, Diane Cooper, said, \u201cI\u2019m just happy. (Trump) did a very good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can say what they want,\u201d Cooper, 70, said. \u201cI\u2019m behind him 100%. He needs to be home. Right is right and wrong is wrong.\u201d\n\nCooper said she didn\u2019t know \u201canything\u201d about a state sentence that might keep her brother behind bars. Representatives of Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoover\u2019s son, Larry Hoover Jr., posted a photo to his Instagram account Wednesday afternoon of someone holding up Trump\u2019s signed order with the words \u201cAlmost home!!\u201d and two praying-hands emojis.\n\nFederal prosecutors have vehemently opposed any breaks for Hoover, now 74, arguing he did untold damage to communities across Chicago during his reign on the streets. They argued he has continued to hold sway over the gang\u2019s hierarchy while imprisoned, even promoting an underling he\u2019d secretly communicated with through coded messages hidden in a dictionary.\n\nHoover\u2019s attorneys, meanwhile, have claimed that decades behind bars have left him a changed man and that prosecutors have unfairly painted him as a puppet master to try to keep him locked up.\n\nAt a hearing last year, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey asked Hoover\u2019s defense attorney point-blank: \u201cHow many other murders is he responsible for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the methodology is for determining that,\u201d attorney Bonjean replied, somewhat taken aback by the unusually blunt query.\n\n\u201cSo many we can\u2019t count?\u201d Blakey shot back.\n\nAfter Bonjean said she couldn\u2019t \u201cput a number on it,\u201d Blakey went a step further and asked if Hoover himself would like to weigh in.\n\n\u201cHe probably has the most knowledge of all,\u201d the judge said.\n\nAt that hearing, which Hoover attended via a live link from prison, he told the judge he\u2019s \u201chad a chance to reflect on my life and the trouble that my existence has caused in the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in (the supermax) you\u2019re locked up at least 21 hours a day. You go away in your cell and reflect on every aspect of your life, and you see things differently,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cYou see things you\u2019re proud of and you see things that maybe you\u2019re not so proud of, and you realize that life is too short.\u201d\n\nIf he were released, Hoover said, he would counsel others how to avoid gangs, not join them.\n\n\u201cI just want to say that I would be a credible risk if you were to allow me to go back to the world,\u201d Hoover said.\n\nBlakey had not yet ruled on Hoover\u2019s motion.\n\nHoover was convicted in state court in 1973 of the murder of William Young, one of Hoover\u2019s gang underlings who was shot to death that same year after he and others had stolen from gang stash houses. He was sentenced to 200 years in prison.\n\nIn the early 1990s, before Hoover was charged in federal court, former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer lobbied the IDOC parole board on his behalf, arguing that Hoover could help stem Chicago\u2019s street violence if he were allowed to return home, the Tribune reported at the time.\n\nHoover was indicted in federal court in 1995 on charges he continued to oversee the murderous drug gang\u2019s reign of terror from prison. He was convicted on 40 criminal counts in 1997, and then-U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentenced him to the mandatory term of life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t always agree with the guidelines,\u201d Leinenweber told Hoover during that hearing. \u201cSometimes I think they are too draconian. But in this case, I agree with them 100%.\u201d\n\nBefore last year\u2019s hearing, prosecutors alleged that during a prison visit with his common-law wife in August, Hoover asked her if his lawyers wanted him to bring a copy of the \u201cBlueprint\u201d to Thursday\u2019s hearing, which the U.S. Bureau of Prisons considers \u201ca blueprint for how to organize a prison gang,\u201d including governing principles, methods of discipline and a membership application.\n\nThe motion also revealed that an email message was sent Aug. 26 by a known Gangster Disciples member to 123 fellow gang members in federal prison referring to Hoover as \u201cDad\u201d and using \u201ccoded terminology, in the form of a basketball analogy, to instruct all incarcerated GDs to stay out of trouble and temporarily suspend gang activity\u201d until Hoover gets a ruling in his case.\n\n\u201cIN SUPPORT OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, THERE WILL BE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY INCIDENTS ON THE COURT,\u201d the all-caps message read, according to the prosecution filing.\n\n\u201cThis communication is deeply concerning,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz wrote at the time. \u201cIt demonstrates the continued power high-ranking GD leaders, and specifically Larry Hoover, hold over the GDs (and) underscores the extremely high risk of recidivism and the danger to the community if Hoover is released.\u201d\n\nSchwartz also said that Hoover\u2019s life sentence was appropriate, given his place as one of the most dangerous criminals ever prosecuted in Chicago\u2019s federal court.\n\nBut Hoover\u2019s lawyers argued it\u2019s the government that has proselytized the myth of Hoover as some arch-criminal who can still command the masses \u2014 because it suits their endgame of keeping him locked up.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that many people from all walks of life, including politicians, celebrities, community activists and people who self-identify as GDs, support Hoover,\u201d Bonjean wrote in a 2022 court filing. \u201cIndeed, the fact that Mr. Hoover is supported by individuals who are not gang members is what frightens the government the most. The government does not want to see a rehabilitated Hoover. It wants to hold on to its narrative of Hoover as the most notorious dangerous, and violent man on the planet.\u201d\n\nBonjean argued in the September hearing that Hoover should be looked at as a human being, not a monster. He entered prison illiterate and has since earned his GED and taken classes on robotics, art history and the life of Abraham Lincoln, she said. A voracious reader, Hoover \u201cwould have a PhD by now if that type of programming was available to him,\u201d according to Bonjean.\n\nShe also said it\u2019s \u201crubbish\u201d to think Hoover is still commanding gang members, some of whom weren\u2019t even born when he entered prison. \u201cIf Mr. Hoover is held responsible for every criminal act by those who self-identify as a GD, well then I guess he\u2019s toast,\u201d she said.\n\njmeisner@chicagotribune.com\n\nckubzansky@chicagotribune.com\n\nscharles@chicagotribune.com", "summary": "President Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover.", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/28/trump-commutes-federal-sentence-larry-hoover/", "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-l-larry-hoover-e1748465244582.jpg?w=1024&h=577", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 00:48:15", "author": "Caroline Kubzansky,Jason Meisner,Sam Charles", "authors": ["Caroline Kubzansky", "Jason Meisner", "Sam Charles"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.068}, {"id": 325943424, "title": "Trump commutes federal life sentence of founding Gangster Disciples kingpin Larry Hoover", "text": "President Donald Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Chicago-born Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover, abruptly ending Hoover\u2019s yearslong quest to win early release under the First Step Act passed during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nThe two-page order said Hoover\u2019s sentence was considered served \u201cwith no further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions,\u201d and directed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to release him \u201cimmediately,\u201d according to a copy of the document provided by Hoover\u2019s legal team.\n\nThe controversial move \u2014 part of a slew of clemency actions announced by the White House this week \u2014 appeared to have already sparked Hoover\u2019s transfer out of the supermax prison compound in Florence, Colorado, that he\u2019d called home for the past two decades.\n\nBut Hoover isn\u2019t going free \u2014 he\u2019s still serving a 200-year sentence for his state court conviction for murder.

He was sentenced to 200 years in prison.\n\nIn the early 1990s, before Hoover was charged in federal court, former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer lobbied the IDOC parole board on his behalf, arguing that Hoover could help stem Chicago\u2019s street violence if he were allowed to return home, the Tribune reported at the time.\n\nHoover was indicted in federal court in 1995 on charges he continued to oversee the murderous drug gang\u2019s reign of terror from prison. He was convicted on 40 criminal counts in 1997, and then-U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentenced him to the mandatory term of life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t always agree with the guidelines,\u201d Leinenweber told Hoover during that hearing. \u201cSometimes I think they are too draconian. But in this case, I agree with them 100%.\u201d\n\nBefore last year\u2019s hearing, prosecutors alleged that during a prison visit with his common-law wife in August, Hoover asked her if his lawyers wanted him to bring a copy of the \u201cBlueprint\u201d to Thursday\u2019s hearing, which the U.S. Bureau of Prisons considers \u201ca blueprint for how to organize a prison gang,\u201d including governing principles, methods of discipline and a membership application.\n\nThe motion also revealed that an email message was sent Aug. 26 by a known Gangster Disciples member to 123 fellow gang members in federal prison referring to Hoover as \u201cDad\u201d and using \u201ccoded terminology, in the form of a basketball analogy, to instruct all incarcerated GDs to stay out of trouble and temporarily suspend gang activity\u201d until Hoover gets a ruling in his case.\n\n\u201cIN SUPPORT OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, THERE WILL BE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY INCIDENTS ON THE COURT,\u201d the all-caps message read, according to the prosecution filing.\n\n\u201cThis communication is deeply concerning,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz wrote at the time. \u201cIt demonstrates the continued power high-ranking GD leaders, and specifically Larry Hoover, hold over the GDs (and) underscores the extremely high risk of recidivism and the danger to the community if Hoover is released.\u201d\n\nSchwartz also said that Hoover\u2019s life sentence was appropriate, given his place as one of the most dangerous criminals ever prosecuted in Chicago\u2019s federal court.\n\nBut Hoover\u2019s lawyers argued it\u2019s the government that has proselytized the myth of Hoover as some arch-criminal who can still command the masses \u2014 because it suits their endgame of keeping him locked up.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that many people from all walks of life, including politicians, celebrities, community activists and people who self-identify as GDs, support Hoover,\u201d Bonjean wrote in a 2022 court filing. \u201cIndeed, the fact that Mr. Hoover is supported by individuals who are not gang members is what frightens the government the most. The government does not want to see a rehabilitated Hoover. It wants to hold on to its narrative of Hoover as the most notorious dangerous, and violent man on the planet.\u201d\n\nBonjean argued in the September hearing that Hoover should be looked at as a human being, not a monster. He entered prison illiterate and has since earned his GED and taken classes on robotics, art history and the life of Abraham Lincoln, she said. A voracious reader, Hoover \u201cwould have a PhD by now if that type of programming was available to him,\u201d according to Bonjean.\n\nShe also said it\u2019s \u201crubbish\u201d to think Hoover is still commanding gang members, some of whom weren\u2019t even born when he entered prison. \u201cIf Mr. Hoover is held responsible for every criminal act by those who self-identify as a GD, well then I guess he\u2019s toast,\u201d she said.\n\njmeisner@chicagotribune.com\n\nckubzansky@chicagotribune.com\n\nscharles@chicagotribune.com", "summary": "President Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover.", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2025/05/28/trump-commutes-federal-sentence-larry-hoover/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-l-larry-hoover-e1748465244582.jpg?w=1024&h=577", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 00:48:15", "author": "Caroline Kubzansky,Jason Meisner,Sam Charles", "authors": ["Caroline Kubzansky", "Jason Meisner", "Sam Charles"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.068}, {"id": 326206022, "title": "Trump commutes sentence of former gang leader Larry Hoover as he grants clemency to dozens", "text": "A White House official confirmed the pardons to the Washington Examiner, noting that the Department of Justice will post the full list on its website.\n\nHoover\u2019s commutation took many by surprise. Former federal prosecutor Ron Safer, who led the prosecution of Hoover\u2019s gang, told the Chicago Sun-Times he did not \u201cunderstand why Hoover, among all of the people in federal custody, is worthy of this result.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a state that spawned Al Capone, I do not believe that there\u2019s a more notorious or prolific criminal than Larry Hoover,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former head of the Chicago gang, Gangster Disciples, was serving a life sentence for the kidnapping and murder of a rival drug dealer when a 17-year investigation by authorities found he was still running the 30,000-member gang from prison, with operations in 35 different states. In 1997, he was found guilty of 40 crimes, including conspiracy, extortion, money laundering, and continuing a criminal enterprise. The latter conviction came after his attempted rebrand as someone who turned away from a life of crime.\n\nSince his most recent conviction, Hoover has been serving a life sentence at the maximum-security ADX Florence prison facility in Colorado. The prison houses some of the U.S.\u2019s worst criminals, including an al Qaeda co-founder, September 11 terrorist attack conspirators, the organizer of the 2011 Benghazi attacks, one of the Boston Marathon bombers, and Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman. Ted Kaczynski, better known as the \u201cUnabomber,\u201d and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh were housed in the facility until their deaths.\n\nSome have suggested that Trump pardoned Hoover due to pleas from rapper Kanye West, a longtime advocate of Hoover\u2019s liberation. He pleaded for the president to release the crime boss during an October 2018 Oval Office meeting, hailing him as a \u201cliving statue\u201d and \u201can example of a man that was turning his life around.\u201d\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t aware of who Hoover was at the time, asking, \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\n\nWest emerged as a major supporter of Trump during his first term, a kinship that lasted until he brought neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes to Mar-a-Lago for dinner with the then-former president. The musician\u2019s recent erraticism and proclamations of love for Adolf Hitler appear to have severed ties between the two.\n\nHoover attorney Justin Moore celebrated his client\u2019s commutation in a text to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\u201cLarry Hoover spent nearly three decades in solitary confinement under the harshest conditions this country has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, he emerged with clarity, humility, and a commitment to peace and transformation.\u201d\n\nDONALD TRUMP PARDONS FORMER NYC CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMM\n\nHoover\u2019s son, Larry Hoover Jr., also celebrated, posting on Instagram, \u201cAlmost home!!\u201d\n\nHowever, the crime boss will not go free.

While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a \"massive spending bill\" that increases the federal deficit and \"undermines the work\" of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\n\n\"I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\" Musk said. \"But I don't know if it could be both.\"\n\nHis CBS interview came out Tuesday night. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\n\n\"I'm not happy about certain aspects of it, but I'm thrilled by other aspects of it,\" he said.\n\nTrump also suggested that more changes could be made.\n\n\"We're going to see what happens,\" he said. \"It's got a way to go.\"\n\nRepublicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.\n\nMusk's concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. \"I sympathize with Elon being discouraged,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nSpeaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was \"pretty confident\" there was enough opposition \"to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious\" about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a \"very delicate balance\" that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying \"the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings.\"\n\nThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE's cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.\n\nMusk's criticism come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He's also said he'll reduce his political spending, because \"I think I've done enough.\"\n\nAt times, he's seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.\n\n\"The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\" he told The Washington Post. \"I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\"\n\nMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\n\n\"The more I've gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\" Musk said in February. \"Frankly, I love him.\"\n\nTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as \"a truly great American.\" When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.\n\nIt's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate. During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.\n\nHis latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk's interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was \"still time to fix it.\"\n\n\"The Senate version will be more aggressive,\" Lee said. \"It can, it must, and it will be. Or it won't pass.\"\n\nOnly two Republicans - Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.Davidson took note of Musk's comments on social media.\n\n\"Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,\" he wrote. \"Don't hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.\"\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.\n\nHouse Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical.

Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip meanwhile killed at least 13 people overnight, local health officials said. Israel captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict. Defense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \u201cstrengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the biblical term for the West Bank. He said it \"anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\u201d He added that the construction of settlements was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d The Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said the announcement was the most extensive move of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the now-defunct peace process. It said the settlements, which are deep inside the territory, would \u201cdramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation even further.\u201d Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and parks. The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship. Peace Now said the plans call for the authorization of 12 existing outposts, the development of nine new settlements and reclassifying a neighborhood of an existing settlement as a separate one. \u201cThe government is making clear \u2014 again and without restraint \u2014 that it prefers deepening the occupation and advancing de facto annexation over pursuing peace,\u201d the group said. Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote. During his first term, President Trump\u2019s administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel\u2019s claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth. The top United Nations court ruled last year that Israel\u2019s presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is unlawful and called on it to end, and for settlement construction to stop immediately. Israel denounced the non-binding opinion by a 15-judge panel of the International Court of Justice, saying the territories are part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people. Israel withdrew its settlements from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but leading figures in the current government have called for them to be re-established and for much of the Palestinian population of the territory to be resettled elsewhere through what they describe as voluntary emigration. Palestinians view such plans as a blueprint for their forcible expulsion from their homeland, and experts say the plans would likely violate international law. Israel now controls more than 70% of Gaza, according to Yaakov Garb, a professor of environmental studies at Ben Gurion University, who has examined Israeli-Palestinian land use patterns for decades. The area includes buffer zones along the border with Israel as well as the southern city of Rafah, which is now mostly uninhabited, and other large areas that Israel has ordered to be evacuated. The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, around a third of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israeli forces have rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. Israeli strikes killed at least 13 Palestinians overnight in Gaza, according to local hospitals. Four were killed in a strike on a car in Gaza City late Wednesday and another eight, including two women and three children, were killed in a strike on a home in Jabaliya. A strike on a built-up refugee camp in central Gaza killed one person and wounded 18. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants are embedded in populated areas.

Strikes on Gaza kill 34, officials say", "text": "By JULIA FRANKEL and NATALIE MELZER\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel said Thursday it would establish 22 more Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli strikes killed at least 34 people, local health officials said.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \u201cstrengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the biblical term for the West Bank. He said it \u201canchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe added that the construction of settlements was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d\n\nWatchdog group says it\u2019s the biggest expansion since Oslo\n\nThe Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said the announcement was the most extensive move of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the now-defunct peace process. It said the settlements, which are deep inside the territory, would \u201cdramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation even further.\u201d\n\nIsrael has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and parks.\n\nThe West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.\n\nPeace Now said the plans call for the authorization of 12 existing outposts, the development of nine new settlements and reclassifying a neighborhood of an existing settlement as a separate one.\n\n\u201cThe government is making clear \u2014 again and without restraint \u2014 that it prefers deepening the occupation and advancing de facto annexation over pursuing peace,\u201d the group said.\n\nSettlements expand with little or no U.S. pushback\n\nIsrael has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nDuring his first term, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel\u2019s claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth.\n\nThe top United Nations court ruled last year that Israel\u2019s presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is unlawful and called on it to end, and for settlement construction to stop immediately.\n\nIsrael denounced the non-binding opinion by a 15-judge panel of the International Court of Justice, saying the territories are part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people.\n\nCalls for settlements in war-ravaged Gaza\n\nIsrael withdrew its settlements from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but leading figures in the current government have called for them to be re-established and for much of the Palestinian population of the territory to be resettled elsewhere through what they describe as voluntary emigration.\n\nPalestinians view such plans as a blueprint for their forcible expulsion from their homeland, and experts say the plans would likely violate international law.\n\nIsrael now controls more than 70% of Gaza, according to Yaakov Garb, a professor of environmental studies at Ben Gurion University, who has examined Israeli-Palestinian land use patterns for decades.\n\nThe area includes buffer zones along the border with Israel as well as the southern city of Rafah, which is now mostly uninhabited, and other large areas that Israel has ordered to be evacuated.\n\nStrikes kill at least 34 in Gaza\n\nAn Israeli airstrike hit a house sheltering several families in Bureij, an urban refugee camp in central Gaza, killing 22 people, including nine women and children, according to officials at nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. An AP journalist viewed the hospital records of the dead.\n\nStrikes in northern Gaza late Wednesday and early Thursday hit a house, killing eight people, including two women and three children, and a car in Gaza City, killing four, local hospitals said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets combatants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the fighters operate in populated areas.\n\nIsrael\u2019s campaign in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nThe campaign was triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, in which terrorists stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, around a third of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements.

The Sun sign represents will and purpose. Aries is the Cardinal Fire and rules the head. Your ruling planet is Mars. Aries tend to be headstrong, energetic, forceful, and outgoing. You are more likely to rush into things before proper planning and exhibit little patience when sitting back and letting events happen or mature without intervention. You have a strong will and can come across as self-centered when achieving your goals, big or small.\n\nThe Sun in the first house represents a collective of energy to be, act, and initiate. You are more likely to be enterprising and ambitious. Courageous, independent, and a natural leader, you forge ahead with your head held high and a determined look in your eye. Others may perceive you as egocentric or overbearing when you don\u2019t take other views into account. You are at your best when you demonstrate your independence, which does not hinder the independence of others.\n\nDaily Horoscope\n\nWith the Sun in the house of Gemini, you may find yourself in full bloom along with nature. There is a sense of community and belonging with your surroundings. You may find yourself and others more willing to open themselves up to share ideas and small talk.\n\nThe Moon represents hidden or emotional needs, it reflects your instincts. With the Waxing Moon in Cancer, a nurturing nature manifests. You may feel more receptive and sensitive to others\u2019 emotional needs. If you feel overwhelmed by the flood, retreat for solitude and solace. When you feel up to socializing, seek moderation to help lessen the severity.\n\nFamily security may be at the forefront of your thoughts today. Feelings of protectiveness for yourself and your family may emerge more intensely. You may find yourself wanting to mother and be mothered. Try not to go overboard and smother, instead. If family and friends do not reciprocate your feelings today, it\u2019s okay. You find yourself becoming defensive, keep a calm state of mind, and let logic and reason seep in. Use this energy and channel it into creative hobbies or endeavors.\n\nLove and Relationships\n\nNow is a great time to fortify marriage or other intimate relationships while the Transiting Moon is in the Seventh House. If you are single Aries, focusing on business partnerships may bring fruitful rewards. You will experience a heightened sensitivity to others\u2019 wants and needs. You may find yourself balancing options and able to see both points of view on disputes. Avoid trying to please everyone or you may find yourself pleasing no one.\n\nFamily and Home\n\nWhile Transiting Mercury is Square Moon, you may experience conflicts at home, Aries. Parents and children may find themselves at odds over miscommunication or differences of opinion. You may have to adjust or change to deal with a minor crisis. Your attitude and self-expression will soften, and you can express your feelings more effectively during this transition.\n\nCareer and Finances\n\nPlanetary energies are polarized as Pluto is Square Jupiter. Be aware, Aries, as outside influences stimulate your choices and perspective. Transforming your philosophy or feelings on spirituality may feel like a top priority. Aries, you are likely to delve into a new research project, whether for work or study, and you may find yourself fully immersed. Travel and educational plans are a valid possibility. Integration shall prove to be your only great challenge during this transit.\n\nWith a calm state of mind, there is nothing you can not handle, Aries. Letting emotions rule your judgment may lead to confrontation. Focus on your goals and let the creative juices flow. Personal relationships will feel deeper or more important to you. Let that someone know you are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.

You don\u2019t have to believe in fate or magic to get something out of them. You just need a moment of honesty with yourself\u2014and maybe a little curiosity about what\u2019s shifting today. Let\u2019s see what May 29, 2025, has in store.\n\nTarot in the Stars\n\nToday\u2019s got layers. The Sun\u2019s still cruising through Gemini, which means your brain is moving at the speed of light. It\u2019s that mental state where you\u2019re juggling five conversations, half a dozen browser tabs, and a random thought about a song you haven\u2019t heard since middle school. Classic Gemini energy: busy, buzzy, a little scattered\u2014but also kind of brilliant.\n\nNow throw in the Moon shifting from Gemini into Cancer. That\u2019s a big switch-up. You might wake up feeling chatty and caffeinated, only to crash later craving quiet, comfort, and someone who just gets you. Emotional whiplash? Maybe. But honestly, it\u2019s the kind that reminds you you\u2019re human.\n\nThis is one of those \u201cdual mode\u201d days. You\u2019ve got fast thoughts and deep feelings fighting for attention. The trick is to let both have their moment. Don\u2019t bury the emotions just because your brain won\u2019t shut up, and don\u2019t drown in feelings when you\u2019ve got stuff to process. You can hold both.\n\nThe Planets Today\n\nSun in Gemini \u2014 Your thoughts are in overdrive, and honestly, that\u2019s not a bad thing. You\u2019re sharp, curious, and probably thinking ten steps ahead. Just try not to overcomplicate things. Say what you need to say, follow your interest, and don\u2019t stress if your focus bounces around. That\u2019s part of how the ideas click.\n\nMoon moving from Gemini to Cancer \u2014 The day starts with social energy\u2014calls, texts, and conversations that jump from one thing to the next. But as the Moon slips into Cancer later on, things slow down. You might feel more emotional, more private, maybe even nostalgic. Let it happen. Cancel the extra plans if your energy shifts. You\u2019re allowed to change your mind.\n\nMercury in Gemini \u2014 This is peak mental activity. You\u2019re reading between the lines, analyzing everything, and maybe overthinking a little (or a lot). It\u2019s great for writing, brainstorming, and clever comebacks. Just don\u2019t forget to pause. Your brain needs a break now and then.\n\nVenus in Cancer \u2014 Relationships are feeling softer today. You\u2019re craving connection, but the kind that feels real and safe\u2014not performative. It\u2019s a good time to check in with someone close or make your space feel more like home. Romance doesn\u2019t have to be loud to be meaningful.\n\nMars in Leo \u2014 There\u2019s no shortage of bold energy right now. You want to lead, impress, maybe even make a bit of a scene\u2014but try to stay grounded. That fire is best used for something creative or courageous, not for proving a point no one asked you to prove.\n\nJupiter in Gemini \u2014 You\u2019re learning whether you mean to or not. Random thoughts, late-night YouTube spirals, weird little facts\u2014they\u2019re all pointing you somewhere. Stay curious, even if the dots don\u2019t connect yet.\n\nSaturn in Aries \u2014 This is where discipline meets the starting line. You\u2019re being pushed to get serious about something new, even if you don\u2019t feel \u201cready.\u201d Don\u2019t wait for the perfect moment. Start where you are.\n\nUranus in Taurus \u2014 If you\u2019ve been clinging to what\u2019s comfortable, this is the nudge to loosen your grip. Change is coming in slow, steady waves. It\u2019s not about chaos\u2014it\u2019s about growth.\n\nNeptune in Pisces \u2014 Dreams feel extra vivid right now, and your gut is speaking louder than usual. Don\u2019t just visualize what you want\u2014take a small step toward it. Make it real, even if it\u2019s tiny.\n\nPluto retrograde in Aquarius \u2014 Old habits, old beliefs, old versions of you\u2014they\u2019re breaking down. It might feel messy, but that\u2019s part of the process. Think of it as clearing space for what\u2019s actually aligned with who you\u2019re becoming.\n\nToday\u2019s Spread\n\nLet\u2019s pull the curtain back a second: tarot isn\u2019t fortune-telling. It\u2019s not going to tell you who to marry or when to quit your job. But it will help you see what\u2019s stirring under the surface. And honestly? That\u2019s where the good stuff is.\n\nThe traditional Rider-Waite deck was used for today\u2019s reading. If you\u2019ve ever Googled tarot, you\u2019ve seen it\u2014classic imagery, bold colors, lots of symbolism. The deck is made up of 78 tarot cards split into two main categories:\n\nMajor Arcana (22 tarot cards): Big life lessons and turning points.\n\nMinor Arcana (56 tarot cards): Daily stuff\u2014your moods, routines, relationships, etc.\n\nThe Minor Arcana is split into four suits\u2014Pentacles, Cups, Wands, and Swords\u2014which represent the elements and areas of life.\n\nSo if today\u2019s reading doesn\u2019t click for you? That\u2019s totally fine. Energy shifts daily. Come back tomorrow and see what\u2019s new. Now, let\u2019s get into the three-tarot-card spread for May 29.\n\nTarot Card 1: Three of Swords (Past)\n\nYeah, this one hurts just looking at it.\n\nThe Three of Swords is the heartbreak tarot card. It\u2019s not always romantic, but it\u2019s always personal. It shows up when something\u2014or someone\u2014cuts deep. Maybe it was a betrayal. Maybe it was a loss you didn\u2019t see coming. Or maybe it was one of those slow-burn hurts, the kind that lingers because it was never really acknowledged out loud.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: even if this happened a long time ago, you\u2019re still carrying pieces of it. Maybe you\u2019ve built your walls a little higher since then. Maybe you learned to keep certain parts of yourself locked up because opening them just didn\u2019t feel safe anymore.\n\nBut this tarot card isn\u2019t here to drag you through old pain for no reason. It\u2019s here to remind you that yeah, that chapter hurt\u2014but it\u2019s not the whole book. That pain taught you something. It helped you survive. But you don\u2019t have to keep reliving it to protect yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to feel it without letting it define you. You\u2019re allowed to let some of it go.\n\nTarot Card 2: The Star (Present)\n\nThis is where it starts to turn.\n\nThe Star is soft but powerful. It\u2019s the quiet kind of hope\u2014the kind that sneaks in when you\u2019re not even sure you believe in it anymore. It doesn\u2019t show up unless there\u2019s a real chance to heal.\n\nRight now, even if everything isn\u2019t fixed, something in you wants to believe again. In yourself. In other people. In the idea that something better might actually be possible. You\u2019re dreaming again\u2014maybe just a little\u2014but it counts.\n\nThis tarot card is a reminder that you don\u2019t have to be all the way \u201cokay\u201d to be on the right path. It\u2019s about faith\u2014not the kind where you cross your fingers and hope for the best, but the kind where you decide to keep showing up anyway.\n\nSo if life feels weirdly tender right now? That\u2019s actually a good sign. You\u2019re not numb anymore. You\u2019re healing.\n\nTarot Card 3: The Moon (Future)\n\nThis tarot card is a whole mood.\n\nThe Moon shows up when things are murky\u2014like when you can\u2019t quite tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s just your brain spiraling at 2 a.m. It\u2019s that feeling when something feels off, but you can\u2019t explain why. Or when your gut\u2019s nudging you in one direction, but your brain\u2019s like, \u201cWait, this makes no sense.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Moon energy. It\u2019s not here to give you a clear answer. Honestly, it\u2019s kind of the opposite. It\u2019s about learning to sit in the unknown and still move forward.\n\nSo if you\u2019re stepping into something new and it\u2019s freaking you out a little\u2014cool. That\u2019s actually part of the process. You\u2019re not supposed to have all the answers right now. You\u2019re supposed to listen to what your intuition\u2019s been whispering, even if it doesn\u2019t line up with your logic.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a red flag\u2014it\u2019s a reminder that not everything is meant to be understood immediately. Sometimes the only way to know what\u2019s right is to go there and feel it out.\n\nTrust yourself more than your fear. You\u2019ve got better instincts than you think.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLet\u2019s be real\u2014today\u2019s a bit of a rollercoaster. Mentally, you\u2019re firing on all cylinders thanks to that Gemini pile-up. But emotionally? The Moon slipping into Cancer brings a whole different flavor. One minute, you\u2019re cracking jokes in the group chat; the next, you\u2019re wondering why a TikTok made you tear up. It\u2019s a lot\u2014but it\u2019s also kind of beautiful.\n\nThe tarot cards get it. The Three of Swords reminds you where you\u2019ve been (and yeah, it stung). The Star says you\u2019re healing, even if you don\u2019t totally see it yet. And The Moon? It\u2019s basically saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy, it\u2019s just a weird time.\u201d Which, honestly, is comforting in its own way.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have it all figured out today. You just have to check in, stay open, and trust your gut a little more than your fear. Take the mental buzz and the emotional swirl as a sign you\u2019re growing\u2014messy, honest, and right on time.", "summary": "Astrology and tarot do something many of us need\u2014they help us slow down and check-in.

It doesn't need to be draconian, but I want to make sure nothing changes. I want to maintain the status quo,\" the judge said at the hearing, which took place as thousands of Harvard students and their families gathered for the school's commencement.\n\nFor now, Judge Burroughs said a temporary restraining order she issued last week will remain in place until a preliminary injunction is ironed out. Over the coming days, both Harvard and the Trump administration will submit proposals for an order that would block DHS from immediately revoking the school\u2019s SEVP certification.\n\nHarvard, under the current ruling, will still able to enroll international students, but DHS said it still plans to pursue the administrative avenue to revoke Harvard's SEVP certification.\n\nJudge Burroughs suggested she would allow that administrative process to play out, with Harvard submitting evidence to rebut the allegations made by DHS that they allowed antisemitism on campus and failed to provide information on international students.\n\nThe judge said that, despite the Trump administration's backtracking, she felt an order was necessary to protect Harvard's international students.\n\n\"I would feel more comfortable given what has preceded this,\" she said during 20-minute hearing. \"It gives some protection to international students who are anxious about coming here.\"\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Tiberius Davis pushed back on the restraining order, saying the issue had effectively become \"moot\" since the Trump administration changed course.\n\n\"The Department has decided it would be better, simpler going forward, to go through the procedure,\" Davis said.\n\nDespite the change, Harvard attorney Ian Gershengorn said that a restraining order was still necessary, arguing that the Trump administration was unlawfully violating the school's First Amendment rights by retaliating against the school for its decision not to budge to other demands from the government. He called the recent notice \"the next step\" in the Trump administration's campaign to retaliate against the school.\n\n\"There seems to be a different set of rules, procedures for Harvard,\" he said. \"The First Amendment harms we are suffering are real and continuing.\"\n\nJudge Burroughs suggested that the parties might end up coming back to court in a few months, once the legal process has played out, to determine if the potential revocation is retaliatory.\n\n\"By that point, we think the case would be quite different,\" Davis said.\n\nArguing that the Trump administration actions are part of a \"campaign to coerce Harvard into surrendering its First Amendment rights,\" Harvard has alleged that the SEVP revocation is unlawful because it violates the school's free speech rights; that the policy is arbitrary and therefore violates the Administrative Procedure Act; and that the policy runs roughshod over the school's due process protections because it was not given the opportunity to respond to the revocation.\n\n\"The surrounding events, and Defendants' express statements, make clear that the Department of Homeland Security took these actions not for any valid reason, but purely as punishment for Harvard's speech, its perceived viewpoint, and its refusal to surrender its academic independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\" the school said in its lawsuit against the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,\" said the suit.\n\nDHS officials have said that the revocation was necessary because Harvard failed to turn over information about international students -- including disciplinary records -- as requested by the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.' DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement last week.\n\nHarvard is also fighting the Trump administration's attempt to freeze more $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the school. Harvard filed a separate lawsuit to challenge the funding freeze in April, and the next hearing in that case is set for July.\n\nTrump has continued to ratchet up the pressure on the school over the last two months, threatening to revoke the school's tax-exempt status, directing his administration to cancel contracts with the school, and continuing to demand information on international students. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump suggested that Harvard should cap the number of international students to 15% of the school's total student body.\n\n\"We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can't get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,\" Trump said.", "summary": "The Trump administration has backtracked on Harvard, giving the school 30 days to challenge the administration's revocation of its ability to host international students.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/graduation-day-harvards-lawyers-head-court-defend-foreign/story?id=122307706", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5740dfb8-bb4e-4dff-82d2-bde10f05f70c/harvard-2-ap-gmh-250529_1748531837076_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 16:41:02", "author": "Peter Charalambous", "authors": ["Peter Charalambous"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.331}]}, {"news": [{"id": 325937296, "title": "Federal trade court blocks Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs under emergency powers law", "text": "A federal trade court on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law.\n\nThe ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based Court of International Trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump has exceeded his authority, left U.S. trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos.\n\n\u201cThe Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\u201d the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

This decision promptly cast uncertainty over Trump\u2019s major economic initiatives that had unsettled global markets, annoyed trade partners, and stoked broader concerns about rising inflation and a potential economic downturn.\n\nThe decision was issued by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. The ruling followed multiple lawsuits which claimed that Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs exceeded his legal authority and made the nation\u2019s trade policy subject to his personal discretion.\n\nTrump had often stated that these tariffs would compel manufacturers to return factory jobs to the United States and generate enough income to decrease federal budget deficits. He employed tariffs as a strategic tool to pressure other nations into making trade deals advantageous to the U.S., implying that he would set tariffs unilaterally if the negotiated terms were not in favor of the U.S.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said that trade deficits amount to a national emergency \u201cthat has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base \u2014 facts that the court did not dispute.\u201d\n\nThe administration, he said, remains \u201ccommitted to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Trump might not have the threat of import taxes to exact his will on the world economy as he had intended, since doing so would require congressional approval. What remains unclear is whether the White House will respond to the ruling by pausing all of its emergency power tariffs in the interim.\n\nTrump might still be able to temporarily launch import taxes of 15% for 150 days on nations with which the U.S. runs a substantial trade deficit. The ruling notes that a president has this authority under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nThe ruling amounted to a categorical rejection of the legal underpinnings of some of Trump\u2019s signature and most controversial actions of his four-month-old second term.

He put a 25% tax on most imported autos and parts, as well as on all foreign-made steel and aluminum.

We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won\u2019t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n our being, and we think she's worth saving from today\u2019s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have \n trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There\u2019s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can\u2019t do it unless you \u2014 \n the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment \u2014 have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there \n are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that \n we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need \n revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent \n we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and \n lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters \n and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.\n\nWe can save America together.\n\nBecome a Daily Caller Patriot today.", "summary": "'This is only the beginning'", "url": "https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/28/hailey-bieber-billionaire-cosmetics-makeup-rhode-elf-beauty-justin-wealth/", "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1829956053-scaled-e1748478105973.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 00:26:08", "author": "Leena Nasir", "authors": ["Leena Nasir"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.054}, {"id": 326138102, "title": "Hailey Bieber Sparks Yet More Divorce Rumors By Celebrating Becoming a Billionaire WITHOUT 'Car-Crash' Husband Justin", "text": "Hailey Bieber has sparked fresh marriage fears by celebrating her $1billion makeup deal without husband Justin.\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal the model, 28, was spotted arriving at West Hollywood restaurant Alba on Wednesday minus the Canadian singer, 31.Marriage CrisisThe couple, who married in 2018 and share nine-month-old son Jack Blues, have been plagued by rumors their relationship is on the rocks for months, amid Bieber's wayward behavior. \n\nAnd the Baby singer was nowhere to be seen as his wife marked her big career news with a lavish meal.\n\nIt was announced on Wednesday hours Hailey is selling her skincare line Rhode in a massive $1billion deal.\n\nThe model launched the company three years ago in June 2022 and it's now been acquired by E.l.f.

A tropical storm has maximum sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph, an upgrade from a tropical depression. HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER Information and location on Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.(FOX Weather) Tropical Storm Alvin is located about 670 miles south-southeast of the southern tip of Mexico\u2019s Baja California Peninsula and is currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as it continues to churn over the open waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Tropical Storm Alvin is expected to remain far enough offshore that impacts along the Mexican coast will be limited to heightened swells and increased rip currents along beaches. These can be a safety hazard for anyone who ventures into the water. The tropical storm is not only the first of the season in the Eastern Pacific, but across all ocean basins that make up the Northern Hemisphere. The amount of inactivity is a bit unusual, with forecasters usually tracking the first significant tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific by April, with the first system in the Eastern Pacific by early June. DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APP Forecast cone for Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.(FOX Weather) FOX Weather Hurricane Specialist Bryan Norcross explained that Tropical Storm Alvin formed in the Eastern Pacific when hurricane season would typically get going. \"The Eastern Pacific season kicked off right on schedule. The ocean water off the southern coast of Mexico is always quite warm, and this year the atmospheric pattern over that part of the ocean is quite conducive for development,\" Norcross said. \"Alvin has a good chance of intensifying significantly over the open water. As it tracks farther north, however, the water cools quickly. So, if Alvin affects Cabo San Lucas or nearby areas in northern Mexico, for example, it looks likely to be a weakening storm.\" The composition of water temperatures in the Eastern Pacific makes the evolution of Tropical Storm Alvin a bit complex and will impact future tropical cyclones. There are large pockets of both warmer and cooler water temperatures, meaning that the tropical cyclone\u2019s strength will be determined by its forecast track. WHAT TO DO WHEN HURRICANE OR TROPICAL STORM WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE ISSUED FOR YOUR TOWN Cone forecast for Tropical Storm Alvin and current water temperatures in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.(FOX Weather) Systems that move over water with temperatures above 78 degrees Fahrenheit are considered to be in an environment warm enough to support the development of tropical cyclones and their continued strengthening. In contrast, cooler water temperatures make it more difficult for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify. Mexico\u2019s National Weather Service forecasts that there will be enough warm water this season to support more tropical cyclones than in a typical year, projecting as many as 18 named storms and 10 hurricanes. 5 DIFFERENT NAMES FOR HURRICANES AROUND THE WORLD Tropical Storm Alvin is expected to reach cooler waters by Friday and quickly fall apart south of Mexico\u2019s Baja California Peninsula. Once the center of circulation dissolves, forecasters will then watch where the tropical storm\u2019s remnants venture for increased precipitation chances over mainland Mexico and potentially into the southern U.S. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through Nov. 30.", "summary": "Tropical Storm Alvin formed in the Eastern Pacific south of Mexico on Thursday, becoming the first named storm of the 2025 hurricane season.", "url": "https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/tracking-topical-storm-alvin-eastern-pacific-mexico", "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1024/512/ts-alvin-11am-story-image.png?ve=1&tl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 14:35:07", "author": "Andrew Wulfeck,Emilee Speck,Steven Yablonski", "authors": ["Andrew Wulfeck", "Emilee Speck", "Steven Yablonski"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.238}, {"id": 326176284, "title": "Tropical Storm Alvin forms in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of western Mexico", "text": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 A weather system swirling off the coast of western Mexico has developed into the first tropical storm of the eastern North Pacific hurricane season, forecasters said Thursday.\n\nTropical Storm Alvin was located about 670 miles (1,080 kilometers) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMaximum sustained winds were clocked at 40 mph (65 kph).

Her lawyers say she was framed in a police conspiracy and someone in the home that night killed him.\n\nA mistrial was declared last year and the second trial has attracted massive media attention and become the subject of a Hulu documentary series. Read's second trial on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene has often looked similar to the first trial. If she is found guilty of the most serious charge of second-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe video in the player above is from an earlier report.\n\nSimplified approach\n\nThe prosecution, led this time by Hank Brennan, has taken a more streamlined, focused approach.\n\nUnlike the first trial where witness after witness undermined the prosecution's case, Brennan did everything to avoid those mistakes. Most significantly, he refrained from putting Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in the case, on the stand.\n\nProctor was fired in March after a disciplinary board found he sent sexist and crude text messages about Read to his family and colleagues. His testimony played a key role in the first trial. Defense attorneys used his text messages to attempt to show Proctor was biased and ignored the possibility of other suspects.\n\nBrennan also didn't put Brian Albert, the Boston officer who owned the house where O'Keefe's body was found, on the stand. He also passed on putting on Brian Higgins, a federal agent who had exchanged flirty texts with Read, on the stand.\n\nAll three testified in the first trial and could be called by the defense as it seeks to show O'Keefe was beaten at the house party hosted by Albert and left outside to die.\n\nRead's attorney, Alan Jackson, still managed to raise concerns about Higgins and Proctor.\n\nDuring the cross-examination of Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Yuriy Bukhenik, he made him read all the flirtatious texts between Higgins and Read.\n\nJackson also brought up a text message chain with Bukhenik in which Proctor said, \"I hate that man, I truly hate him\" about David Yannetti, an attorney for Read.\n\nStick to the evidence\n\nBroken pieces of Read's taillight. A broken cocktail glass. Read's words the scene.\n\nProsecutors have spent much of the trial building their case through evidence from the scene. Like before, they started by introducing several law enforcement witnesses who were among the first responders and recalled hearing Read repeatedly say \"I hit him\" after she found O'Keefe.\n\nThey also played several clips of interviews Read has done since the first trial, in which she talked about how much she drank and made comments suggesting she knew what she did. She also talked about pulling a piece of glass from O'Keefe's nose.\n\n\"Could I have clipped him? Could I have tapped him in the knee and incapacitated him?\" she said during an interview for a documentary on the case. \"He didn't look mortally wounded, as far as I could see\" but \"could I have done something that knocked him out and in his drunkenness and in the cold didn't come to again.\"\n\nProsecutors called a neurosurgeon who testified O'Keefe suffered a \"classic blunt trauma injury\" associated with falling backward and hitting the back of his head.\n\nProsecutors also showed jurors pieces of the Read's broken taillight, which they say was damaged when she hit O'Keefe. The defense argues the taillight was damaged later when she was backing out of O'Keefe's house and hit O'Keefe's car.\n\nProsecutors also introduced evidence of a broken cocktail glass, found at the scene, which they said O'Keefe was holding when Read backed into him.\n\nDNA evidence played a part\n\nAndre Porto, a forensic scientist who works in the DNA unit of the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, detailed various items he tested, including the broken rear taillight and pieces of a broken cocktail glass found in in the yard. Only O'Keefe was a likely match for both.\n\nPorto found three DNA contributors but only O'Keefe was a likely match. He also tested DNA from parts of a broken cocktail glass found in the yard and only O'Keefe was seen as a likely match. Porto also tested a hair found on the taillight.\n\nLater in the trial, analyst Karl Miyasako of Bode Technology testified that tests of the hair sample taken from Read's vehicle found a mitochondrial DNA match to O'Keefe. He said that means the DNA could be a match to O'Keefe or any one of his maternal relatives.\n\nWhat's next for defense\n\nThe trial could easily continue several more weeks as Read's defense team makes its case.

The couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans as well as tax evasion; their sentences were later reduced.

WATCH: Todd and Julie Chrisley's daughter Savannah gets emotional awaiting parents' prison release after Trump pardon \"Julie has also been released from prison and is now on her way home to Nashville as well.\" Here\u2019s a closer look at the Chrisleys and the legal storm that landed them behind bars. Todd and Julie, along with their children \u2013 Savannah, Chase and Grayson \u2013 rose to fame after their popular reality series \"Chrisley Knows Best\" debuted. The famous show premiered in 2014 on the USA Network and quickly gained popularity due to its mix of humor, family drama and Todd's bold persona. The Chrisley family, known for their extravagant lifestyle, initially lived in Atlanta, Georgia before moving their clan to Nashville, Tennessee, during the fourth season. Todd, whose full name is Michael Todd Chrisley, is the owner of Chrisley Asset Management, and he made millions in the real estate world in addition to his success as a house flipper. TRUMP ANNOUNCES PARDON FOR TODD AND JULIE CHRISLEY AFTER REALITY TV STARS' FRAUD, TAX EVASION CONVICTIONS Before Todd met Julie, he was previously married to his high school sweetheart, Teresa Terry, for seven years. The former couple have two children together: daughter Lindsie and son Kyle. Julie was also previously married to her high school love, Kenneth Wayne Childress, in 1991 when she was 18 years old. It's unclear when she split from her late ex-husband, but she and Todd tied the knot on May 25, 1996, while pregnant with their first son. She gave birth to Chase Chrisley nearly one week later on June 1, 1996. Savannah and Grayson Chrisley are the couple's youngest children, and had their own spin-off show, \"Growing Up Chrisley.\" The spin-off started in 2019, and aired for four seasons before it was canceled after Todd and Julie's sentencing. The couple was initially indicted in August 2019, and a new indictment was later filed. They were found guilty in June 2022 of not only bank fraud and tax evasion but also conspiring to defraud the IRS. In the original filing, both Chrisleys were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, five counts of bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one count of tax fraud. Julie Chrisley was also charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice. Prosecutors found the couple guilty of submitting fake documents to banks when applying for loans. Todd and Julie did see a minor court victory in 2019 when the Georgia Department of Revenue cleared the couple of a $2 million state tax evasion charge stemming from a two-year investigation of nearly eight years of returns beginning in 2008.

The couple is now headed home to Nashville, a law firm representing the Chrisleys told CNN Wednesday.\n\nThe Chrisleys\u2019 release was part of a succession of contentious new pardons by Trump, including former Republican New York congressman Michael Grimm, who served seven months for tax evasion and Connecticut\u2019s former Republican Gov. John Rowland, who was convicted of campaign-related federal crimes.\n\nThe \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d couple was sentenced for conspiracy to defraud banks out of more than $30 million and was also found guilty of several tax crimes, including attempting to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBoth had maintained their innocence and were in the process of appealing their convictions when their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, received a call from the president on Tuesday, informing her that her parents would receive full pardons.\n\n\u201cSome of these decisions about pardons aren\u2019t necessarily about guilt and innocence: they\u2019re about how the process works, or whether it should work this way,\u201d Alex Little, an attorney for the Chrisleys, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Wednesday night after their release. \u201cI think ultimately, the White House was convinced it didn\u2019t work the way it should have.\u201d\n\nIn an unsuccessful appeal last year, the Chrisleys\u2019 attorneys argued that the prosecution knowingly allowed for false testimony against the couple and that they had insufficient evidence to convict them, the Associated Press reported. Judges at the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Chrisleys\u2019 conviction, but ordered that Julie Chrisley\u2019s case be sent back to a lower court to be resentenced due to a calculation error.\n\n\u201cThe pardon process is here to say we don\u2019t think the end result was the correct one, and that\u2019s what the president did today,\u201d Little said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before the couple\u2019s release, Savannah Chrisley said she had been fighting for her parents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people say, \u2018I wonder what she had to do to get this pardon.\u2019 I didn\u2019t have to do anything. I didn\u2019t have to do anything other than stand firm in my beliefs and my convictions and fight for my parents and fight for what was right,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not only am I fighting for my parents, I\u2019m literally fighting for every single man that\u2019s being left behind here today. There are so many here that deserve a second chance.\u201d\n\nSavannah Chrisley spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July. She also campaigned for Trump as part of \u201cTeam Trump\u2019s Women Tour\u201d and recently appeared on Lara Trump\u2019s Fox News program to discuss her parents\u2019 plight.\n\nSpeaking at the White House Wednesday, the president weighed in on even more potential pardons, saying he was \u201cgoing to look at it,\u201d when asked if he planned to pardon the men convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov.

He added that his Department of Government Efficiency's \"mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, will begin his offboarding process with the White House on Wednesday night, according to an administration official. Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts at nearly every federal agency and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts. Musk has said the effort has cut around $160 billion in spending. However, some of the spending cuts cited by DOGE have contained errors, and one report estimates the cuts could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and the cost of putting staff on leave and re-hiring some workers. The White House said in February that Musk is a \"special government employee,\" or SGE. The designation allowed him to work for the executive branch, subject to different ethics rules than federal employees. But SGEs are limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period. Friday, May 30, would mark 130 days since Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term and when Musk's work at DOGE began. Musk's announced departure comes a day after a \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview where he criticized the budget bill passed by House Republicans last week. The bill has been backed heavily by Mr. Trump, who dubbed it the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent David Pogue in a broadcast exclusive interview.In an April earnings call with Musk's car company Tesla, he told investors his time at DOGE would \"drop significantly\" in May so he could focus on his companies. Musk suggested he would spend one to two days a week on government work, \"as long as the president would like me to do so.\" Some Tesla investors pushed Musk to dial back his involvement in the Trump administration, worrying his attention was divided and the carmaker's brand was at risk.White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday that the Trump administration will make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through a bill in Congress known as a rescission package, which is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent. Vought said that cuts to foreign aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as funds to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, would be included first.", "summary": "Elon Musk signaled his time as a government employee is winding down.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-signals-his-time-leading-doge-is-coming-to-an-end/", "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/29/5277051c-8e80-4a6d-899f-1b62b7c34100/thumbnail/1200x630g1/0ef35f295c2880b23e14de26044108e4/gettyimages-2216843063.jpg?v=0ec0a9b0c45ecf3b0dd269ffc8f350b0", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3787140_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-05-29 01:31:41", "author": "Aaron Navarro", "authors": ["Aaron Navarro"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.352}, {"id": 326056874, "title": "Elon Musk\u2019s Time At DOGE Comes To End", "text": "Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you \u2014 our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and \n joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won\u2019t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n our being, and we think she's worth saving from today\u2019s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have \n trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There\u2019s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can\u2019t do it unless you \u2014 \n the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment \u2014 have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there \n are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that \n we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need \n revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent \n we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and \n lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters \n and editors.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nA three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade ruled Trump\u2019s tariffs imposed on April 2 should be \u201cset aside,\u201d siding with business groups and Democratic-led states that asked the court to strike the tariffs down as unlawful.\n\nThe judges agreed with plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Trump doesn\u2019t have authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives presidents the power to impose some sanctions during national emergencies.\n\nIEEPA does not explicitly mention anything about tariffs, which plaintiffs argued means that Trump doesn\u2019t have authority to impose them under the law, and the trade court agreed, writing, \u201cAny interpretation of IEEPA that delegates unlimited tariff authority is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe ruling halts Trump\u2019s tariffs on nearly every country - minus the tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada that were imposed prior to April 2 - but the White House is likely to appeal the decision, and either an appeals court or the Supreme Court could quickly put the tariffs back in effect.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders covering his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\u201d the three-judge panel wrote in their ruling.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nTrump is all but certain to appeal the court\u2019s ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court could put the tariffs back into effect, as Bloomberg noted in April that court has historically been deferential to presidents when it comes to tariffs. It\u2019s likely the dispute will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court, though it\u2019s unclear how and when justices could rule on the issue. Trump could also try to impose his tariffs though other laws, but legal experts told Forbes prior to Wednesday\u2019s ruling that other laws would require Trump to go through a lengthier process to impose any tariffs.\n\nGot a tip?

In its ruling, the three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade unanimously found that Congress did not give the president \u201cunbounded\u201d tariff authority in the IEEPA.\n\n The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.\n\n Last month, Trump and his allies announced that April 2 was a historic \u201cLiberation Day\u201d for the United States, with a baseline 10-percent tariff on all imported goods and the White House releasing a list of nations and their respective tariff percentage, many of which cleared 50 percent.\n\n Bizarrely, Trump even placed tariffs on the remote Australian territory Heard and McDonald Islands \u2014 an outpost inhabited only by penguins and other Antarctic wildlife.\n\n As financial markets tanked, the economy contracted in the first quarter of 2025, and major financial institutions warned that the president\u2019s trade war will lead to higher inflation, unemployment, and instability, Trump began to roll back his tariff agenda following his lofty claims. The president significantly reduced the potentially ruinous tariffs he had implemented against China after he paused his initial \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. In a seeming reversal over the weekend, Trump threatened to impose a 50 percent tariff on all goods from the European Union, but then backed off days later.\n\n On Wednesday, the president erupted when a reporter asked him to respond to his nickname emerging from Wall Street \u2014 \u201cTACO\u201d (Trump Always Chickens Out) \u2014 as a result of the Trump\u2019s tariff flip-flopping. \n\n \u201cSix months ago, this country was stone cold, dead. We had a dead country. We had a country, people didn\u2019t think it was going to survive,\u201d Trump claimed, growing increasingly inflamed. \u201cWe were doing no business because of the tariff, because it was so high.

Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.\n\nThe justice department has said the lawsuits should be dismissed because the plaintiffs have not been harmed by tariffs that they have not yet paid, and because only Congress, not private businesses, can challenge a national emergency declared by the president under IEEPA.\n\nMany of those country-specific tariffs were subsequently paused.

Todd Chrisley was released from a minimum-security prison camp in Pensacola in the evening, and Julie Chrisley left a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, according to Shannen Sharpe, a spokesperson for the couple\u2019s attorney.\n\n\u201cWe just want to get home. We want to be reunited,\u201d the couple\u2019s daughter, Savannah Chrisley, told reporters outside the Florida prison earlier as she awaited her father. She said her brother Grayson was meeting their mother in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cMy parents have not spoken to each other, heard each others\u2019 voices or seen each other in the past 2 \u00bd years,\u201d said Savannah Chrisley, who wore a bubble gum pink MAGA hat and matching \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d jacket.\n\nThe Chrisleys\u2019 TV show portrayed them as a tight-knit family with an extravagant lifestyle. Prosecutors at the couple\u2019s 2022 trial said they spent lavishly on expensive cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel after taking out fraudulent bank loans worth millions of dollars and hiding their earnings from tax authorities.\n\nTrump announced his intention to pardon them on Tuesday, saying the celebrity couple had been \u201cgiven a pretty harsh treatment based on what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d It was another example of the president, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.\n\nSavannah Chrisley has been a vocal Trump supporter and endorsed his candidacy in a speech at the Republican National Convention last summer. Though she has complained that the case against her parents was politically motivated, they were indicted in 2019 under a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.\n\nRegardless, Savannah Chrisley said officials in the Trump administration who reviewed her parents\u2019 case had \u201cseen the corruption.\u201d She told reporters that the president delivered the news of the pardons himself, calling unexpectedly while she was at the grocery store.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to do anything other than stand firm in my beliefs and my convictions and fight for my parents,\u201d she said.\n\nShe paused to take photos with fans and supporters gathered outside the prison before getting into a vehicle that took her past its security checkpoint.\n\nThe Chrisleys\u2019 attorney, Alex Little, said Tuesday that the pardon \u201ccorrects a deep injustice\u201d in which the couple were \u201ctargeted because of their conservative values and high profile.\u201d\n\nBefore she was pardoned, Julie Chrisley, 52, had been scheduled for release in January 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, while Todd Chrisley, 56, was to remain behind bars until September 2032.\n\nProsecutors said at trial that the Chrisleys had not yet become TV stars when they and a former business partner submitted false documents to banks in the Atlanta area to obtain fraudulent loans. New loans were taken out to pay off the old ones, according to prosecutors, until Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20 million in unpaid loans.\n\nThe defense argued that an IRS officer gave false testimony during the trial and that prosecutors lacked evidence to support convictions.\n\nA panel of judges of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Chrisleys\u2019 convictions last year.\n\nWaiting to meet her father, Savannah Chrisley said her family was making plans to do a lot of catching up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, Christmases, all the things,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to make up for the lost time.\u201d", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-culture/2025/05/28/todd-and-julie-chrisley-released-from-prison-after-trump-pardons", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c76e32/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2741x1565+0+131/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2F73%2Fa04e3fd142d395868e5b2e28dead%2Fap25", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 02:43:26", "author": "Russ Bynum | Ap,Stephen Smith | AP", "authors": ["Russ Bynum | Ap", "Stephen Smith | AP"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.078}, {"id": 326056858, "title": "Todd And Julie Chrisley Released From Prison", "text": "Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you \u2014 our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and \n joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won\u2019t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n our being, and we think she's worth saving from today\u2019s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have \n trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There\u2019s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can\u2019t do it unless you \u2014 \n the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment \u2014 have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there \n are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that \n we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need \n revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent \n we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and \n lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters \n and editors.

Levis was candid about his situation. \"Anyone who's ever been in my situation would agree that it sucks,\" Levis said on Wednesday, according to NFL.com. \"I'm just trying to do the best I can to not let it affect me and just being the same dude every day in the building and being there for the guys however I can and just trying to get better every day.\" Levis is coming off a turbulent 2024 season, which saw the Titans go 2-10 in the games that he started; he missed time due to a shoulder injury and was benched for Mason Rudolph late in the year. In what was his second season in the NFL, Levis ranked 52nd among quarterbacks in rushing grade (58.2), 60th in overall grade (54.9) and 62nd in passing grade (54.6), according to Pro Football Focus. Levis started 21 games for the Titans from 2023-24, with the team going 5-16. He averaged 1,950 passing yards, 11 passing touchdowns, eight interceptions and an 82.7 passer rating per season, while completing 61.0% of his passes. Despite losing his starting job, Levis remains dialed in. \"I haven't been a backup in a while, but I don't plan on shifting my mindset, regardless of what the situation is,\" Levis said. \"I'm just going to be ready to play quarterback whenever my name is called.\" The Titans traded up to select Levis with the No. 33 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft out of Kentucky. Levis started two seasons for the Wildcats (2021-22), most notably helping lead them to a 10-3 record in 2021, which was preceded by two seasons at Penn State, with whom he was primarily a backup to starting quarterback Sean Clifford. Outside of Ward, a 2024 Heisman Trophy finalist, and Levis, Tennessee's quarterback room also includes Brandon Allen and Tim Boyle. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Israel Sanchez was on his way to the grocery store to make soup for his family and never came home. He did everything right, looking for oncoming traffic and abiding by pedestrian signage, but tragically Mr. Klinghoffer, in a rush and on his phone, hit him fatally from behind with a large SUV. The loss and grief that the Sanchez family now faces is immense.

Most days, there are between three and five clues in each direction on a five by five grid, but the puzzles are sometimes larger, especially on Saturdays.\n\nUnlike its larger sibling, the NYT Mini crossword is free to play on the New York Times website or NYT Games app. However, you\u2019ll need an NYT Games subscription to access previous puzzles in the archives.\n\nThe NYT Mini is a fun daily distraction that usually takes no time at all.

This language-heavy puzzle will test your knowledge of that field pretty heavily, between BANTU, URDU and HINDI. I also apparently did not know how to spell ASICS as I definitely thought there was an E in there somewhere. I live in the Big 10 area but ISU escaped me regardless.

Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns \u2b1b\ufe0f, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. \ud83d\udfe8 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. \ud83d\udfe9 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.\nYour second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.\nAfter that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above.\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.\n\nKerry Brunskill\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nContributing Writer\n\nWhen baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the daily Wordle puzzle to give readers a hint each and every day.

When she hosted SNL last year, conservative media figures crowed that her d\u00e9colletage signaled \u201cthe death of woke.\u201d After a photograph of her sunbathing on a boat went viral, commenters chimed in with bizarre and lewd remarks about her body. As a hypervisible public figure, Sweeney has said that she has come to terms with being unable to control her image and comments about her appearance, particularly among her predominantly male fanbase. But Sweeney hasn\u2019t eschewed the internet completely. Instead, she\u2019s trying a different tack: Being in on the joke, perhaps in a way that comes with a paycheck.\nLast fall, when Sweeney dropped a saucy ad for the male personal care brand Dr. Squatch that featured her soaking in a bathtub while calling viewers \u201cdirty little boys,\u201d horny fans took notice\u2014and, specifically, began clamoring for a taste of her bathwater. Sweeney tells GQ that she \u201cdefinitely was not aware\u201d of the erotic implications around bathtub water \u201cuntil I started seeing it in my own comments.\u201d But she obliged. Sweeney is now selling bar soap for Dr. Squatch\u2014the same brand that once featured Nick Cannon poking fun at himself siring 12 children in an ad for ball-care products\u2014made from pine bark extract, sand, and, naturally, actual droplets of her dirty bathwater. In a nod to her Pacific Northwest roots, it\u2019s also meant to evoke the smell of Douglas fir trees and moss. We\u2019re sure the internet will be totally chill about this one too.\nSweeney spoke briefly with GQ about the product, growing up in the Pacific Northwest, and why she thinks dirty bathwater may be in the zeitgeist. This interview has been condensed for clarity and length.\n\nGQ: Were you surprised by this very particular request for bath water, or did you have a feeling this might happen?\nSydney Sweeney: I honestly think it's a really fun, full-circle moment, because fans always joke about wanting my bath water\u2026I was like, This is just such a cool way to have a conversation with the audience and give them what they want. But then also hopefully encourage them to take care of themselves in a healthy way.\nDid you see Saltburn? I wonder if that might be why drinking someone\u2019s bathwater is still in the zeitgeist.\nI did. Honestly, it probably has been a huge catalyst for it.\nWhat has it been like for you to grapple, as a public figure, with a fanbase that can have a \u201ccartoon wolf going AWOOGA\u201d feeling to it sometimes?\nI have a really amazing group of friends and family that are not really in the industry, and they just keep me very grounded and humbled. And whenever I'm not doing press or working on set or anything, I go back and my life's normal. So I think that it's finding a really healthy balance, and then also just kind of taking it day by day. I think because I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, I love being outside. My go-to isn't oh, I want to go sit on the couch and watch TV and scroll my phone. It\u2019s: I want to go outside. I want to go jet-skiing. I want to go build a treehouse. I want to go hiking. I want to go on an adventure. Having that ingrained in me has really helped.\nYou might be one of the only people in history to start and then actually finish building a treehouse.\n[Laughs] This is a funny story. My parents were really, really cool, because they always wanted me to be very independent and hands-on. And so they'd give me the tools, but then I'd have to do it. And so I built a treehouse. I mean, it wasn't even something crazy. It was just a platform with some railings and a ladder, but I had a rope that would dolly all my tools up, and I felt really cool as a fourth grader doing this.\nI finished building it, and then I painted it. I don't even remember what I painted, but I was very, very proud of it. I remember walking in and just telling my parents all about it, and showed them the paint from my art room that was\u2026washable paint. And I remember walking up the next day and the entire tree and the ground underneath was just covered with all the paint. And my beautiful mural had just completely washed off. I was so sad.\nYou\u2019ve spoken in the past about how challenging it\u2019s been to navigate Hollywood as someone who grew up working-class, and how taking brand deals has been a necessity for you to make ends meet. Has your philosophy around what deals you take changed at all?\nI make sure that every brand that I become a part of, I organically and authentically use. It's super important to me to make sure that whenever I'm saying, hey guys, I really, really love this product, or, hey, I really use this that, I actually am. I'm a consumer just like everybody else. If it doesn't actually work for the person and they're just saying it, it doesn't benefit any of us.\nSo would you actually use this soap bar yourself?\nI do have the bar. I actually took a shower this morning, and I have the bar and I used it.\nWhat's the skin feel of this bar of soap?\nIt\u2019s super soft. It's really pretty, I'm looking at it right now. It's marbly and has blues and a little bit of brown in it.\nWhen we were at the [Dr. Squatch] shoot, they had a tub for me. And I actually got in there and I took some soap, and we had a nice little bath and they took the water. So it's my real bath water. I wanted to have it lean towards my home roots, so there's this really outdoorsy scent of, like, pine and earthy moss and fir. So it smells super manly. But then there's some city bath water mixed in.\nWere you inspired by other products evoking a specific sense of intimacy? I'm thinking of someone like Erykah Badu, who\u2019s created incense meant to smell like her nether region.\nNo, but I would like to say yes, because that's the coolest thing ever (laughs).\nWhy do you think a woman\u2019s bathwater has such a powerful and erotic draw for people?\nUm, because women are awesome?\nDo you see the concept of selling your bathwater as wresting back power for yourself in terms of your image?\nYeah, of course. It\u2019s funny, and there's a lot of different plays that are in motion at that time. My hope is that it just gets guys to think about taking care of themselves and cleaning themselves with some healthy products.\nI mean, I have been in some pretty disgusting dude bathrooms before.", "summary": "Okay, settle down: She's teamed up with Dr. Squatch to create a limited-edition soap.

Hopefully, this helps guys wake up to the realities of conventional personal care products and pushes them towards natural.\"\n\n Called Sydney's Bathwater Bliss, the natural soap \"bricc\" is formulated with Sweeney's used bathing water, exfoliating sand, and pine bark extract; it contains notes of pine, Douglas fir, and moss.

This bar is bizarre, unexpected, and intended to get guys to think more deeply about the ingredients in the products they are putting on their bodies.\"\n\n In her original viral ad, Sweeney can be seen sitting in a tub filled with bubbles as she calls out all the \"dirty little boys\" watching who are \"interested in my body\u2026 wash.\" The Euphoria star then encourages them to make the switch to Dr. Squatch's Natural Body Wash.\n\n Sweeney's Instagram post announcing her bathwater soap drew very divided reactions from fans. \"Thanks, I'll take 100,\" one person commented.

While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a \u201cmassive spending bill\u201d that increases the federal deficit and \u201cundermines the work\u201d of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201dHis CBS interview came out Tuesday night. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\u201cI\u2019m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I\u2019m thrilled by other aspects of it,\u201d he said.Trump also suggested that more changes could be made.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a way to go.\u201dRepublicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.RELATED STORY | Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' approved by House after overnight sessionMusk's concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. \u201cI sympathize with Elon being discouraged,\u201d said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.Speaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d there was enough opposition \u201cto slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious\u201d about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.Speaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a \u201cvery delicate balance\u201d that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.On Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying \u201cthe House is eager and ready to act on DOGE\u2019s findings.\u201dThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE\u2019s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.Musk\u2019s criticism come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He's also said he'll reduce his political spending, because \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201dAt times, he's seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.\u201cThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\u201dMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\u201cThe more I\u2019ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\u201d Musk said in February. \u201cFrankly, I love him.\u201dTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as \u201ca truly great American.\u201d When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.It's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate. During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.His latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk's interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was \u201cstill time to fix it.\u201d\u201cThe Senate version will be more aggressive,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt can, it must, and it will be.

Despite the upheaval, the billionaire entrepreneur struggled in the unfamiliar environment of Washington, and he accomplished far less than he hoped.\n\nHe dramatically reduced his target for cutting spending \u2014 from $2 trillion to $1 trillion to $150 billion \u2014 and increasingly expressed frustration about resistance to his goals. Sometimes he clashed with other top members of Trump\u2019s administration, who chafed at the newcomer\u2019s efforts to reshape their departments, and he faced fierce political blowback for his efforts.\n\nMusk\u2019s role working for Trump was always intended to be temporary, and he had recently signaled that he would be shifting his attention back to running his businesses, such as the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\nBut administration officials were often vague about when Musk would step back from his position spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, and he abruptly revealed that he was leaving in a post on X, his social media website.\n\n\u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d\n\nA White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed Musk\u2019s departure.\n\nMusk announced his decision one day after CBS released part of an interview in which he criticized the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda by saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by what the president calls his \u201cbig beautiful bill.\u201d\n\nThe legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. Musk described it as a \u201cmassive spending bill\u201d that increases the federal deficit and \u201cundermines the work\u201d of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\n\n\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d\n\nTrump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I\u2019m thrilled by other aspects of it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also suggested that more changes could be made.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a way to go.\u201d\n\nRepublicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.\n\nMusk\u2019s concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. \u201cI sympathize with Elon being discouraged,\u201d said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nSpeaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d there was enough opposition \u201cto slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious\u201d about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a \u201cvery delicate balance\u201d that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying \u201cthe House is eager and ready to act on DOGE\u2019s findings.\u201d\n\nThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE\u2019s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.\n\nMusk occasionally seemed chastened by his experience working in government.\n\n\u201cThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\u201d\n\nHe also recently said that he\u2019ll reduce his political spending, because \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d\n\nMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. After putting at least $250 million behind Trump\u2019s candidacy, he wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\n\n\u201cThe more I\u2019ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\u201d Musk said in February. \u201cFrankly, I love him.\u201d\n\nTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as \u201ca truly great American.\u201d When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if any, impact that Musk\u2019s comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate, especially given his departure from the administration. During the transition period, when his influence was on the rise, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.\n\nHis latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk\u2019s interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was \u201cstill time to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate version will be more aggressive,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt can, it must, and it will be. Or it won\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\nOnly two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.\n\nDavidson took note of Musk\u2019s comments on social media.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.\n\nHouse Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical.

More questions in the Oval Office at the White House on May 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe amount of people who like Musk hasn\u2019t changed much since he endorsed Trump on July 13, the day he was shot in Pennsylvania, but the number of people who view him unfavorably has increased significantly, according to Nate Silver\u2019s Silver Bulletin.\n\nMusk\u2019s favorability rating has gone from 41% in mid-July to 39% as of Thursday, a day after he announced he was formally leaving his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, according to the polling average.\n\nHis unfavorability rating has increased 14 points, from 40% to 54%.\n\nOne of the most recent reputable polls on Musk, conducted May 23-25 by Morning Consult, found 40% have a very or somewhat favorable opinion and 52% have a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion.\n\nA CNN poll conducted in March, at the height of Musk\u2019s work at DOGE, found the majority of respondents believed Musk has neither the experience nor judgement to carry out Trump\u2019s changes to the federal government and found they were worried the cuts would go too far, though results were largely split along party lines.\n\nMusk announced Wednesday in a post on X he was formally exiting his role at DOGE, predicting \u201cthe DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\u201d Musk made the announcement less than a month after he said he would significantly scale back political spending and just days after he publicly criticized Trump\u2019s signature policy legislation for adding to the federal deficit.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate Musk is worth $430.9 billion.\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who will lead the Department of Government Efficiency in Musk\u2019s absence. While Musk was the de facto head of department, the Trump administration said that former health care executive, Amy Gleason, was technically the acting administrator of DOGE. Gleason did not have a public-facing role and the extent of her involvement in DOGE\u2019s activities is unclear, however.\n\nKey Background\n\nMusk took a heavy-handed approach to cutting government spending during his time in the Trump administration, gutting some agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, entirely, and laying off tens of thousands of employees across the federal government. He admittedly fell far short of his goal to make $1 trillion in cuts, however, and many of the terminations were reversed by the courts or acknowledgements that they were made in error. Musk became a fixture at Trump\u2019s side after he endorsed him in July and subsequently donated $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign, joining him on international trips and weekends at Mar-a-Lago and sometimes spending the night at the White House. Trump\u2019s affinity for Musk did not extend to the broader Republican party, however, as many GOP lawmakers publicly expressed doubts about the cuts Musk made.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nElon Musk Exits Trump Administration\u2014What To Know (Forbes)\n\nElon Musk Says He\u2019ll Remain Tesla CEO For Next 5 Years And \u2018Do A Lot Less\u2019 Political Spending (Forbes)\n\nMusk \u2018Disappointed\u2019 With Trump\u2019s Spending Bill\u2014Says It Undermines DOGE\u2019s Work (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

He \"dramatically reduced his target for cutting spending \u2014 from $2 trillion to $1 trillion to $150 billion\" \u2014 and federal spending actually increased.

During that time, the Trump administration faced a lawsuit which asserted that it violated federal privacy laws in giving DOGE access to systems containing personal information on millions of Americans without their consent.Musk has also faced fierce backlash amid his drastic cuts to the government's budget, including thousands of federal jobs, and the dismantling of entire agencies. Amid the uproar, Tesla cars and Tesla property have been targeted by protesters in action linked to Musk's right-wing activism, causing the company's market share to decline.What To KnowSince joining DOGE, Elon Musk's public image has taken a significant hit, according to polling.Across multiple surveys, Musk's favorable ratings hover in the mid-30s to low-40s, with unfavorable ratings significantly higher. For example, a Marquette University Law School poll conducted from May 5 to May 15 found that only 39 percent of respondents viewed Musk favorably, while 59 percent expressed unfavorable opinions. Similarly, a Cygnal poll from May 6 to May 8 recorded a 44 percent favorable rating against a 52 percent unfavorable score.The trend is mirrored in polls by Harris Insights & Analytics, which reported a 41 percent favorable and 49 percent unfavorable rating in mid-May, and Echelon Insights, which also found a 41 percent favorable score but with a slightly higher 51 percent unfavorable rating.The Global Strategy Group's survey, conducted from May 15 to May 18, revealed one of the most negative results, with Musk's favorability plunging to 35 percent and unfavorable views rising to 58 percent.Even long-running polls from Morning Consult and The New York Times/Siena College highlighted a similar divide, unfavorable ratings exceeding 50 percent in nearly every survey.Pollster Nate Silver's tracker also shows Musk's approval rating deep underwater, with 54 percent of Americans viewing him unfavorably and 40 percent viewing him favorably. That is down from 41 percent who viewed the billionaire favorably on January 20, the first day of the Trump administration, while his unfavorable rating has risen from 47 percent.Altogether, Musk's net favorability has declined from -5 points at the beginning of the Trump administration to -14 points, Silver's tracker shows.Meanwhile, the latest HarrisX poll showed that while 63 percent support trying to cut the size of the federal government, 54 percent believe DOGE have gone about doing so in the wrong way. And in the latest Echelon Insights poll, 55 percent said they disapprove of Musk's role in the federal government. Additionally, in the latest Global Strategy/Navigator Research poll, 28 percent said Trump had given Musk too much power.And as Musk's reputation has taken a hit, so has the reputation of his companies, particularly Tesla and SpaceX.In the latest Global Strategy/Navigator Research poll, 67 percent of Americans said the fact that SpaceX and Tesla have received billions in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax breaks under the Trump administration while Musk has served as a close Trump advisor was \"corrupt.\"Newsweek has contacted Space X, Tesla and the White House for comment via email.And the 2025 Axios Harris Poll 100 survey revealed that Tesla and SpaceX's reputations have suffered significant declines, dropping to 95th and 86th, respectively\u2014placing them in the poll's bottom fifth.Since Elon Musk joined DOGE, Tesla's sales and market share have dropped, especially in Europe, where backlash has intensified over Musk's political views.Tesla's global sales have also dropped, with the company seeing its first annual delivery decline in a decade and falling by 13 percent in Q1 2025\u2014its worst performance in nearly three years.Meanwhile, Tesla's worldwide vehicle deliveries dropped by two percent in the first two months of this year.In April, thousands gathered in a series of global \"Hands Off!\" protests, expressing outrage over Musk's attempts to gut federal agencies and cut the federal workforce. Hundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations have also taken place, urging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and shares of the company's stock in protest of Musk.Amid the uproar, Tesla cars and property have been targeted and torched across the United States as protesters demonstrated against Musk's appointment as an unelected official. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the attacks are \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\"What People Are SayingMusk said on X: \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"What Happens NextMusk will likely pivot back to focusing on Tesla after leaving his rolepost at DOGE.

Harrison Ruffin Tyler died on Sunday evening, May 25, his family said in a statement to CBS News. His grandfather, who was born in 1790, left the Oval Office more than 179 years ago, after serving from 1841 to 1845, well before the Civil War. President Tyler's immediate descendants lived into the modern age because of two generations of late second marriages to much younger wives.John Tyler, a Virginian slave owner and lifelong Democrat, served as the vice president to William Henry Harrison and became president quite unexpectedly after Harrison died suddenly three weeks after his inauguration \u2014 the first president to die while in office. At the time, succession plans weren't fully established and Tyler was initially hesitant about taking over, according to the National Constitution Center. He took the oath of office in public on April 6, 1841, saying, \"I am the President, and I shall be held responsible for my administration.\"John Tyler was married twice and had 15 children \u2014 eight children with his first wife, Letitia, who died from a stroke, and then seven more with his second wife, Julia Gardiner Tyler, who was 24 when they married. He fathered most of the second set of children in his 50s and 60s; his last child, a daughter named Pearl, was born when he was 70 years old, according to the University of Virginia's Miller Center.Tyler's 13th child, Lyon, was born when his father was 63 years old. Lyon Gardiner Tyler, who served as president of William and Mary College, also married twice. With his second wife, Sue Ruffin Tyler, he had two sons born in the 1920s, when Lyon was in his 70s, according to Encyclopedia Virginia. One of those children was Harrison Ruffin Tyler. Harrison Ruffin Tyler lived in Virginia and co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company, in 1968. He loved history and his birthplace, Charles City County, Virginia, his family said, which led to his work preserving both Sherwood Forest, President Tyler's home, and Fort Pocahontas, a Civil War fortification nearby\"He will be remembered for his considerable charm, generosity and unfailing good humor by all who knew him,\" Annique Dunning, executive director of Sherwood Forest, said in a statement.", "summary": "Harrison Ruffin Tyler's grandfather left the Oval Office more than 179 years ago.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harrison-ruffin-tyler-grandson-president-john-tyler-dies/", "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/28/434f0531-2fc2-4548-85f0-5f8f3a3bb5c1/thumbnail/1200x630g1/28d03f63c2ffd93a4d4a48aadf566049/gettyimages-113626564.jpg?v=0ec0a9b0c45ecf3b0dd269ffc8f350b0", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 00:19:00", "author": "Cara Tabachnick", "authors": ["Cara Tabachnick"], "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.006}, {"id": 325942940, "title": "Grandson of 10th U.S. President John Tyler, Whose Term Ended in 1845, Dies at 96", "text": "Harrison Ruffin Tyler, the grandson of President John Tyler, died on Sunday, May 25. He was 96.\n\n Harrison, who was the son of Lyon Gardiner Tyler and grandson of the 10th U.S. president, John Tyler, was the last living connection to an 18th-century presidential administration. On Harrison\u2019s maternal side, his mother, Susan Ruffin Tyler, was a direct descendant of Pocahontas.\n\n One hundred eighty years after his grandfather served in the White House, Harrison died of dementia in a Virginia nursing home, according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch. He died five years after his last remaining sibling, Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr., who died in September 2020 at age 95. \n\n Harrison was born on Nov. 9, 1928, meaning he was born 138 years after his grandfather was born. At Harrison\u2019s birth, his father, Lyon Sr., was 75 years old, and his grandfather had been deceased for 66 years. The president was 63 when he welcomed Lyon Sr. He had a total of 15 children when he died in 1862 at 71 years old.\n\n Harrison attended St. Christopher's School in Richmond, Va., and later William & Mary and Virginia Tech. In 1968, he and his business partner, William P. Simmons, founded industrial water treatment company ChemTreat, and would later serve clients such as Kraft and Philip Morris.\n\n In 1957, Harrison married Frances Payne Bouknight Tyler, who died in 2019. They welcomed two sons, a daughter, and had eight grandchildren.\n\n Seven years later, he bought his grandfather\u2019s former home, Sherwood Forest Plantation. He and his wife then restored it and opened it up to the public. Harrison, who became a prominent preservationist, bought and financed the preservation of Fort Pocahontas in 1996. The historic site was a Civil War earthwork fort that was built by Black Union soldiers.\n\n Then in 2001, he donated thousands of papers and books and $5 million to William & Mary\u2019s history department. The department was then renamed in his honor in 2021, per The Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n\n Harrison's presidential grandfather was born shortly after George Washington's first inauguration in 1790 and grew up on a Virginia plantation, according to The New York Times. Tyler became president after the death of his predecessor, William Henry Harrison in 1841 \u2014 the first vice president to succeed a president in this way. President Harrison died 31 days into his administration.\n\n According to the Times, Tyler was \"a lifelong slaveowner and a champion of states' rights,\" which at that time hinged on the issue of slavery.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In 2012, he spoke with CBS about his late grandfather, stating: \u201cWhen you talk to about my grandfather born in the 1700s, there is a disconnect there.\" Adding, \"It is somewhat incredulous because of the time frame.\"\n\n That same year, he opened up to the Intelligencer about his grandfather\u2019s legacy, and said it's \u201cvery difficult\u201d to rank him among the other presidents.\n\n \u201cHe\u2019s been maligned in some ways, because he was elected to the Confederate Congress, so people say he\u2019s a traitor,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut actually, he should be known for his efforts as the organizer of the Peace Conference in Washington in 1861.\"\n\n \u201cAnd he did not serve in the Confederate Congress.

He\u2019s playing with fire!\u201d Here apparently was evidence from the horse\u2019s mouth that Trump has long been playing nice with and protecting the tyrannical Russian leader and war criminal. There were, of course, no details.\n\nTrump was reacting to Russia\u2019s recent escalation of deadly drone and missile attacks on Ukraine\u2014the largest bombardment of the war targeting Ukrainian cities. These assaults marked the first time since Putin invaded Ukraine over three years ago that Moscow has drawn opprobrium from Trump. Two days earlier, he had expressed a similar sentiment, stating, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia.\u201d But in this post he groused that Putin \u201chas gone absolutely CRAZY!\u201d and was \u201cneedlessly killing a lot of people\u2026for no reason whatsoever.\u201d He declared that if Putin wants \u201cALL of Ukraine\u201d that \u201cwill lead to the downfall of Russia!\u201d\n\nDid these messages signal some sort of pivot for Trump? Who knows with him? Trump could just as easily in the middle of the night zap out a post inviting Putin to his big, beautiful upcoming military parade in Washington, DC. But these posts have returned to the spotlight the curious relationship between Trump and Putin, and any such assessment has to include a fundamental fact that has been memory-holed and generally absent from the national political conversation: Trump initially won the presidency partly because Putin covertly attacked the 2016 election.\n\nSince he returned to the Oval Office, Trump has generally acted in sync with his longstanding affinity for Putin. He badgered and threatened Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, blaming him for the Russia-Ukraine war that was launched by Putin, and repeatedly expressed sympathy and support for Putin, even as Russian forces bombed civilian targets and continued kidnapping thousands of Ukrainian children. It seemed rather obvious that Trump wanted the war to end not because he was outraged by Putin\u2019s vicious and vile assault on democracy and decency but so he would be free to work with the Russian autocrat for whom he has expressed admiration for over a decade.\n\nIn 2013, when Trump announced he would be staging his Miss Universe contest in Moscow\u2014a venture that would earn him several million dollars thanks to the event being underwritten by a Putin-friendly oligarch\u2014he asked, via a tweet, if Putin, who at that point was ratcheting up his repressive ways, would \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d When he was in Moscow for the pageant, Trump, who had long chased deals in Russia (and who had attracted Russian money for his various business projects), was obsessed with meeting with Putin. No tete-a-tete transpired. In subsequent years, he often hailed the Russian (\u201cstrong,\u201d \u201csmart\u201d), and he periodically sought to develop a Trump tower in Moscow\u2014a project he secretly pursued while running for president in 2016. (His personal attorney, Michael Cohen, even sought assistance from Putin\u2019s office for the deal, which eventually fizzled.)\n\nTrump has for years been yearning for an out-in-the-open bromance with Putin\u2014perhaps like the profitable relationships he has forged with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other nations. But this desire has been impeded by the Ukraine war and also complicated by an inconvenient fact: Trump would not likely have reached the White House without Putin\u2019s assistance.\n\nFor nine years, Trump has done a masterful job of suppressing what was perhaps the most important story of the 2016 race: Moscow attacked the US election to assist Trump, and Trump and his crew aided and abetted that assault by denying it was happening. With his relentless ranting about \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia,\u201d the \u201cRussia hoax,\u201d and the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d\u2014propaganda enthusiastically embraced and loudly amplified by right-wing media and GOP leaders\u2014Trump has essentially erased from public discourse Putin\u2019s successful subversion of an US election and Trump\u2019s own traitorous complicity.\n\nThere have been multiple official reports and much media reporting on this matter. But one only need turn to a bipartisan 966-page report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020, when it was chaired by none other than Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), now Trump\u2019s secretary of state and national security adviser, to get a clear picture of what had happened four years earlier:\n\nThe Committee found that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian effort to hack computer networks and accounts affiliated with the Democratic Party and leak information damaging to Hillary Clinton and her campaign for president. Moscow\u2019s intent was to harm the Clinton Campaign, tarnish an expected Clinton presidential administration, help the Trump Campaign after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, and undermine the U.S. democratic process.\n\nThere is nothing ambiguous there. Nor was there any uncertainty in the report that Trump and his campaign took advantage of Putin\u2019s clandestine operation and, worse, helped it by claiming it didn\u2019t exist\u2014that is, echoing Putin\u2019s denials and abetting Moscow\u2019s coverup:\n\nWhile [Russian intelligence] and WikiLeaks were releasing hacked documents, the Trump Campaign sought to maximize the impact of those leaks to aid Trump\u2019s electoral prospects. Staff on the Trump Campaign sought advance notice about WikiLeaks releases, created messaging strategies to promote and share the materials in anticipation of and following their release, and encouraged further leaks. The Trump Campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia and was indifferent to whether it and WikiLeaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort. \n\nWhether there was any collusion\u2014and the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report did reveal that Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign chair, secretly met during the race with a Russian intelligence officer who might have been involved in the operation targeting the US election\u2014Trump, at the least, was assisting a foreign adversary as it schemed to sabotage a US election.\n\nThe Russian assault in 2016 included several components, including flooding social media with messages meant to exacerbate political discord and boost Trump. What likely had the most impact on the race was the hack-and-release operation, in which Russian cyber-warriors pilfered politically sensitive and occasionally embarrassing emails and documents from John Podesta, chair of the Hillary Clinton campaign, and slipped them to WikiLeaks, which then released them during the final weeks of the campaign\u2014creating a steady stream of bad press that weighed down the Clinton effort in the home stretch.\n\nGiven how close the vote was in 2016, a number of events could be considered decisive\u2014such as then-FBI Director Jim Comey\u2019s last-minute revival of the investigation of Clinton\u2019s handling of official email when she was secretary of state. But that list includes the Russian attack. Without it, Trump might not have narrowly won. The country will never know for sure, but Putin got what he wanted: Trump in power\n\nEver since, Trump has loudly and repeatedly bleated there was no Russian operation that helped grease his way into the White House\u2014and he has avoided accountability for his own act of betrayal. He has gone so far as to say he believes Putin\u2019s phony claims of innocence and to reject the findings of the US intelligence community, which concluded Moscow mounted this assault on American democracy to improve Trump\u2019s chances.\n\nMoreover, Trump has whined that both he and Putin have been victimized by the assorted Trump-Russia investigations. During his infamous meeting in the Oval Office with Zelenskyy on February 28, Trump evinced sympathy for Putin, suggesting the Russian leader had been unfairly tainted by these probes: \u201cLet me tell you: Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and \u2018Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia.\u2019 You ever hear of that deal?\u201d\n\nTrump was revealing to the public that he felt a powerful bond with Putin, insisting both he and the Russian dictator had been falsely maligned. It was an absurd moment. The facts have long been established: Putin subverted a US election and assisted Trump, and Trump endorsed and advanced Putin\u2019s fake denials. Was Trump now saying this\u2014expressing fellowship with this despotic warmonger\u2014out of a sense of loyalty to him or gratitude? Does Putin have any leverage over him? Or has he deluded himself into believing that Putin did not intervene in the election so he can regard his victory as unstained? Or was he just playing the part of a useful idiot? Whatever the case might be, Trump was voicing heartfelt solidarity with an authoritarian who has committed war crimes. No surprise, he was showing us that what most mattered to him about Putin was not his ruthless war in Ukraine or his totalitarian governance of Russia but their shared plight due to \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia.\u201d\n\nThis statement indicated something uniquely bizarre about Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin remains. There\u2019s no telling how that will influence how Trump handles the latest developments in Ukraine and how he responds to Putin\u2019s intransigence and horrific violence. As of this writing, Trump has griped about Putin\u2019s recent bombing. But he has yet taken no steps to further punish Russia. On Wednesday, he downplayed the possibility of slapping Moscow with no sanctions, saying. \u201cIf I think I\u2019m close to getting a deal, I don\u2019t want to screw it up by doing that.\u201d\n\nAs Trump seeks to implement autocratic and corrupt rule in the United States, his dealings with Putin are likely to be complex and, perhaps, erratic. He hates Zelenskyy. He admires Putin. He wants the war to go away. He foolishly promised he could make that happen in 24 hours. He doesn\u2019t know what to do, and Putin, still aiming to crush a democratic Ukraine, is not helping. The known history between the two\u2014and there could be important aspects that are unknown\u2014is complicated and still puzzling. But as pundits, politicians, and voters assess how Trump is faring with all this, they ought to keep foremost in mind that he\u2019s sitting in the White House partly because of Putin\u2019s skullduggery. That\u2019s the original sin of the Trump presidencies, and many in Ukraine and America are bearing its consequences.", "summary": "Donald Trump set off another social media eruption on Tuesday when he posted on his money-losing Truth Social site, &#8220;What Valdimir Putin doesn&#8217;t realize is that if it weren\u2019t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD.

With his co-author Alex Thompson, Tapper conducted 300 interviews for the book Original Sin that surely proved that.\n\nAs a result, they said, \u201cDemocrats are now in the wilderness, and they are trying to figure out how to regain the trust of the American people.\u201d\n\nMany news shows and stories used the book\u2019s launch to explore why the Democratic Party has such low approval now and what they must do to navigate a path back.\n\nBut you must be living in a bubble if you believe this \u201ccover-up\u201d is the main reason for the disastrous election last November.\n\nAt least two-thirds of voters were desperate for change in the election, and nothing was more important than their desperation about the sustained high prices for everything important to their family. In Democracy Corps\u2019s survey right after the election, fully two-thirds choose \u201cinflation and the cost of living\u201d as their top worry. That number stood out almost 20 points above the next problem, \u201cimmigration and the border.\u201d And those are the actual \u201coriginal sins\u201d that drive the distrust of Democrats.\n\nBiden\u2019s chief of staff Ron Klain understood that the president had to address the cost of living as prices spiked after the pandemic. To achieve that, he allowed me to edit the \u201cPrep Version\u201d of President Biden\u2019s remarks to the AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention on June 14, 2022. I made a few edits in track changes to the president\u2019s version to show his new priorities.\n\nI deleted \u201cThe fact is my plan is working for working Americans.\u201d I replaced it with \u201cThe fact is my plan has made working families more resilient in the face of spiking inflation and gas prices hitting them now.\u201d\n\nI cut \u201cwe are now living through the strongest\u2014fastest\u2014most widespread and equitable recovery in American history\u201d and substituted new text about helping working families \u201cfaced with post-pandemic global inflation.\u201d\n\nBut the president rejected those edits to this critical speech to the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe president went on to conduct many events on \u201cBidenomics.\u201d In January 2024, I wrote to his campaign team, \u201cYou have conducted an experiment\u2014speaking positively about the economy for two years. Your approval rating has only declined every month.\u201d The perception that we have a \u201cpoor economy\u201d only grows.\n\nThe president\u2019s insistence on lauding the economy over a two-year period even as people faced continued unaffordable prices led to growing anger with him. Biden was seen increasingly as uncaring, out of touch, and not on your side.\n\nIn fact, Biden is not vastly different from earlier Democratic nominees and presidents in talking up the American economy. President Barack Obama cheered the millions of new jobs created on his watch and in 2016 said, \u201cWe created 15 million new jobs, incomes are rising, poverty is falling.\u201d Hillary Clinton committed to \u201cbuild on the progress.\u201d Candidate Kamala Harris said, \u201cIt will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress.\u201d\n\nSome have suggested Democrats apologize for Biden getting the economy wrong. But you first must answer this: Why aren\u2019t Democrats more critical of an economy that has failed so many people? Why do so many economists and commentators describe the economy as \u201cthe envy of the world\u201d?\n\nBut as daunting as the problems with the economy are, so is the other original sin of President Biden: failing in his responsibility to manage the country\u2019s border and stem the flow of refugees into the country. In my poll, Trump securing \u201cthe border\u201d and deporting \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d was by far the top reason to vote for him. And the top reason to vote against Harris was Biden\u2019s \u201copen borders and illegal immigrants in all our cities.\u201d\n\nThe consuming worry in my survey if you imagined Harris winning was \u201cThe border being wide open to millions of impoverished immigrants, many are criminals and drug dealers who are overwhelming American cities.\u201d\n\nHow do you begin to be trusted after such a worry? Democrats might have taken a step if Harris had said, \u201cThis is an issue where I differ with the president.\u201d Imagine if she had acknowledged that we\u2019d lost control and should have changed course two years earlier.\n\nThat would have been a start, but today Democrats remain deep in the wilderness and continue to lose ground to Republicans on which party people register in and identify with.\n\nI worked to elect President Bill Clinton.

For certain infrastructure projects that are built, funded, or approved by the Federal Government, NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement, or EIS. The EIS must address the significant environmental effects of a proposed project and identify feasible alternatives that could mitigate those effects.\n\nNEPA was the first of several landmark environmental laws enacted by Congress in the 1970s. Subsequent statutes included the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, among others.\n\nUnlike those later-enacted laws, however, NEPA imposes no substantive environmental obligations or restrictions. NEPA is a purely procedural statute that, as relevant here, simply requires an agency to prepare an EIS\u2014in essence, a report. Importantly, NEPA does not require the agency to weigh environmental consequences in any particular way. Rather, an agency may weigh environmental consequences as the agency reasonably sees fit under its governing statute and any relevant substantive environmental laws.\n\nSimply stated, NEPA is a procedural cross-check, not a substantive roadblock. The goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking, not to paralyze it.\n\nIn this case, the U. S. Surface Transportation Board considered a proposal by a group of seven Utah counties for the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah. Under federal law, the Board determines whether to approve construction of new railroad lines. The railroad line here would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin\u2014a rural territory roughly the size of the State of Maryland\u2014to the national rail network. By doing so, the new railroad line would facilitate the transportation of crude oil from Utah to refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere. And the project would bring significant economic development and jobs to the isolated Uinta Basin by better connecting the Basin to the national economy.\n\nFor that proposed 88-mile Utah railroad line, the Board prepared an extraordinarily lengthy EIS, spanning more than 3,600 pages of environmental analysis. The Board's EIS addressed the environmental effects of the railroad line. But the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit nonetheless faulted the EIS for not sufficiently considering the environmental effects of projects separate from the railroad line itself\u2014primarily, the environmental effects that could ensue from (i) increased oil drilling upstream in the Uinta Basin and (ii) increased oil refining downstream along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.\n\nOn that basis, the D. C. Circuit vacated the Board's EIS and the Board's approval of the 88-mile railroad line. As a result, construction still has not begun even though the Board approved the project back in December 2021.\n\nWe reverse. First, the D. C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases. Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate intime or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line. But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue. Under NEPA, the Board's EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-milerailroad line. And the Board's EIS did so.", "summary": "Environmental Impact Statements do not have to consider upstream and downstream effects.", "url": "https://reason.com/volokh/2025/05/29/supreme-court-narrows-scope-of-nepa-review/", "image": "https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 14:34:11", "author": "Jonathan H.

Therefore, in the case of the Surface Transportation Board, which has expertise in transportation, it would not be required to consider the effects of oil drilling and refining. \n\n\u201cUnder NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible,\u201d Sotomayor said. \n\n\u201cHere, the Board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the Railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process,\u201d she said. \n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the ruling as he recused himself from the case.\n\nThe ruling was a major win for the Trump administration and Republicans, who have blamed NEPA for causing undue delays, excessive litigation, and additional costs within the permitting process for large-scale energy projects.\n\nSupporters of the law, enacted in 1970, have insisted that NEPA is critical to avoiding the endangerment of public lands and wildlife, as well as to efforts to combat climate change. \n\nThe law has remained at the forefront of the permitting reform debate in Washington, with both Republican members of Congress and President Donald Trump taking steps to simplify NEPA-required reviews. \n\nMost recently, Trump signed an executive memorandum aimed at quickening the permitting process by bolstering the technology used in issuing these environmental reviews.

Most of the children are adults now. One of them (my niece) was recently married and is asking if her new husband's sister (and possibly her boyfriend) can come to the reunion.\n\nWe don't have anyone other than immediate family attend, although we do have a special attendee this year. My brother-in-law's mother is here from South America. She will be coming only for the day rather than the whole weekend. How do I politely refuse my niece's request without hurting her feelings? \u2014 MORE OR MERRIER?\n\nDEAR M. OR M.: An exception has already been made for your brother-in-law's mother. I'm not sure you can refuse to include your niece's new husband's sister (and possibly her boyfriend) this time around without causing hurt feelings. Throw a few more hot dogs on the grill and cross your fingers that everyone will have a good time \"just this once.\"\n\nDEAR ABBY: I have been married for 34 years. My husband often accuses me of having cheated on him and being disrespectful to him throughout our marriage. I have said some things in ways I agree were disrespectful, especially after I have been accused of lying, etc. However, I have never cheated or lied to him, as he so often accuses me of. What do you advise? \u2014 HONEST IN GEORGIA\n\nDEAR HONEST: I wish you had written to me about this when it started. If you had, I would have pointed out that people who accuse their partners of lying to them and cheating on them often have done exactly that themselves. He's accusing YOU of disrespect? What do you think he has been doing? Tell your accuser/abuser that if he has proof of his accusations, he should come with you to a marriage and family therapist and discuss it, or you are going to leave him. Then, depending upon his response, follow through.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My grandson is transgender and gets very hurt when I misgender his name. I am nearly 80 and use \"she\" sometimes when talking to him. I wrote him a letter at college (we exchange letters all the time) and told him my brain is old, and if I keep saying \"she\" when we talk, maybe we should just keep writing and see each other less often if it keeps hurting him.

The company\u2019s profits fell 71% year-over-year in the first quarter, while market share slipped amid rising EV competition, especially from China\u2019s BYD (BYDDY). \n\nThis downturn led to intensified pressure from shareholders for Musk to commit to Tesla full time. On Wednesday, a group of top shareholders urged the board to require Musk to spend at least 40 hours a week on Tesla business.\n\nRecent reports suggesting Tesla might consider a leadership transition were denied by the company \u2014 but one analyst described the potential move to oust Musk as a \u201cwarning shot.\u201d Instead, Tesla is said to be negotiating a pay package that would lock Musk in.

He was 73.\n\n His agent, Theo Caesar, confirmed the death to Entertainment Weekly and noted his client was \"a great guy.\"\n\n In Big Trouble in Little China, the 1986 action comedy costarring Kurt Russell and Kim Cattrall, Kwong portrayed Rain, one of the Three Storms (the others are Carter Wong's Thunder and James Pax's Lightning) that Russell faces in his mission in what has become a cult classic.\n\n Also in 1986, Kwong appeared in The Golden Child, which costarred Eddie Murphy as a private detective looking for a special missing child.\n\n The actor's professional acting career began in the mid-\u02bc70s, with appearances on popular TV series such as Wonder Woman, Little House on the Prairie, Dynasty, 227, and Miami Vice.\n\n In his big year for film roles, Kwong was also cast in 1986's Never Too Young to Die, which starred a pre-Full House John Stamos as an action hero and costarred Gene Simmons and Vanity. (Kwong himself appeared on Full House in 1988.) He costarred alongside Christian Slater in the 1989 action drama Gleaming the Cube.\n\n Kwong's work in the late \u02bc80s and beyond was often on TV. He appeared on series such as The Wayans Brothers, Malcolm & Eddie, General Hospital, My Wife and Kids, JAG, and Drake & Josh. One of his final appearances was a 2020 episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\n In addition to acting, Kwong was \"a true champion of union rights,\" his agent noted. The actor served on various boards, including the SAG National Board of Directors for more than 10 years and for four years on the Television Academy Board of Governors, according to Deadline.\n\n In 2016, Kwong was one of the dozens of people who signed a letter protesting jokes made about Asians during the Oscars broadcast.\n\n \"I was there at the Academy Awards, and I was shocked because [Academy President] Cheryl Boone-Isaacs went up and talked about diversity and then right after that comes the jokes from Chris Rock and Sacha Baron Cohen,\" Kwong told Deadline of the offending incidents. \"Some people have the attitude, 'Why can't you have a sense of humor?' and 'in humor there are no boundaries.' It's because it gives people permission to not only continue it but to escalate it as well.\"\n\n The Academy of Motion Pictures, the organization behind the annual awards show, later apologized for the \"tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians.\"\n\n In 2023, Kwong was given the Snow Leopard Award for Outstanding Cinematic Achievement at the Asian World Film Festival.", "summary": "\"The Golden Child\" actor was also known for his union activism.", "url": "https://ew.com/actor-peter-kwong-of-big-trouble-in-little-china-dies-at-73-11744131", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/QMcCT1jVxi4FzRcG9U9JWv8HgAs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Peter-Kwong-in-BIG-TROUBLE-IN-LITTLE-CHINA-052825-a215494691304f09919a4593904e8fb6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-29 03:36:54", "author": "Raechal Shewfelt", "authors": ["Raechal Shewfelt"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.365}]}], "language": "en", "country": "us"}
