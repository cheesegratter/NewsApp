You have four five-letter words to guess and nine attempts to find them all. The catch is that you play all four words simultaneously.\n\nIf you get a letter in the right place for any of the four words, it will light up in green. If a word contains a letter from one of your guesses but it\u2019s in the wrong place, it will appear in yellow. You could always check out the practice games before taking on the daily puzzle.\n\nHere are some hints for today\u2019s Quordle game, followed by the answers:\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Quordle Hints?\n\nWord 1 (top left) hint \u2014 scold\n\nWord 2 (top right) hint \u2014 a teacher of Judaism\n\nWord 3 (bottom left) hint \u2014 windy\n\nWord 4 (bottom right) hint \u2014 weapon used by mounted knights\n\nOne word has a pair of repeated letters\n\nToday\u2019s words start with C, R, G and L\n\nPlay Puzzles & Games on Forbes\n\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes\u2122\n\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\n\nPinpoint By Linkedin\n\nGuess The Category\n\nQueens By Linkedin\n\nCrown Each Region\n\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\n\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Quordle Answers?\n\nSpoiler alert!

I hope you\u2019ve had a fabulous week so far.\n\nThis is a big day and not only because the Nintendo Switch 2 is finally out in the world. I reached a 99-game Connections winning streak yesterday. That\u2019s by far my longest streak (my previous best was 32). A win today will take me into double figures. That would be quite nice. Ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of the universe, but arbitrary numbers do something to our brains.\n\nI want to feel those endorphins hit hard as my streak counter tips over into double figures. I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nBefore we begin, we have a great little community on Discord, where we chat about NYT Connections, the rest of the NYT games and all kinds of other stuff. Everyone who has joined has been lovely. It\u2019s a fun hangout spot, and you\u2019re more than welcome to hang out with us.\n\nDiscord is also the best way to give me any feedback about the column, especially on the rare (or not-so-rare) occasions that I mess something up. I don\u2019t look at the comments or Twitter much. You can also read my weekend editions of this column at my new newsletter, Pastimes.\n\nToday\u2019s NYT Connections hints and answers for Thursday, June 5 are coming right up.\n\nHow To Play Connections\n\nConnections is a free, popular New York Times daily word game. You get a new puzzle at midnight every day. You can play on the NYT\u2019s website or Games app.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n\u2018Disgusting Abomination\u2019: Musk Turns On Trump\u2014Rips Policy Bill In New Angry Rant\n\nBitcoin \u2018Going To Take Over\u2019\u2014Tesla CEO Elon Musk Backs Shock $40 Trillion U.S. Dollar Collapse Warning Amid Price Boom\n\n\u2018NYT Mini\u2019 Crossword Hints For Wednesday, June 4: Clues And Answers For Today\u2019s Game\n\nYou\u2019re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.\n\nThere\u2019s only one solution for each puzzle, and you\u2019ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.\n\nEach group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.\n\nSelect four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you\u2019re incorrect, you\u2019ll lose a life. If you\u2019re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you\u2019re one word away from getting it right, but you\u2019ll still need to figure out which one to swap.\n\nIf you make four mistakes, it\u2019s game over. Let\u2019s make sure that doesn\u2019t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you\u2019re really struggling, today\u2019s Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it\u2019s easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.\n\nIf you have an NYT All Access or Games subscription, you can access the publication\u2019s Connections archive. This includes every previous game of Connections, so you can go back and play any of those that you have missed.\n\nAside from the first 60 games or so, you should be able to find our hints Google if you need them! Just click here and add the date of the game for which you need clues or the answers to the search query.\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Hints?\n\nScroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today\u2019s Connections groups, I\u2019ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.\n\nToday\u2019s 16 words are...\n\nAnd the hints for today\u2019s Connections groups are:\n\nYellow group \u2014 almost there...\n\nGreen group \u2014 water lot of stuff\n\nBlue group \u2014 Xzibit surely saw many of these on an MTV show he hosted in the 2000s\n\nPurple group \u2014 if it makes you happy, Steve McQueen, none of these are criminals. In fact, their talent is hot stuff\n\nOne Word For Each Connections Group\n\nNeed some extra help?\n\nBe warned: we\u2019re starting to get into spoiler territory.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at one word for each group.\n\nToday\u2019s Connections word hints are\u2026\n\nYellow group \u2014 EVE\n\nGreen group \u2014 PIPE\n\nBlue group \u2014 SPOILER\n\nPurple group \u2014 CROW\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Groups?\n\nToday\u2019s Connections groups are...\n\nYellow group \u2014 precipice\n\nGreen group \u2014 plumbing equipment\n\nBlue group \u2014 ways to modify a car\u2019s exterior\n\nPurple group \u2014 Best Female Rock Performance Grammy winners\n\nWhat Are Today\u2019s Connections Answers?\n\nSpoiler alert! Don\u2019t scroll any further down the page until you\u2019re ready to find out today\u2019s Connections answers.\n\nThis is your final warning!\n\nToday\u2019s Connections answers are...\n\nYellow group \u2014 precipice (BRINK, CUSP, EVE, VERGE)\n\nGreen group \u2014 plumbing equipment (PIPE, PLUNGER, SNAKE, WRENCH)\n\nBlue group \u2014 ways to modify a car's exterior (BUMPER, GRILLE, RIM, SPOILER)\n\nPurple group \u2014 Best Female Rock Performance Grammy winners (APPLE, CROW, SUMMER, TURNER)\n\nI found it quite interesting that both PIPE and APPLE carried over from yesterday\u2019s game! RIM could have gone with the car-related stuff but I thought it made more sense with VERGE, BRINK and CUSP. But no! I was one away from a group there. I realized a moment later that EVE should go with those three. I blame the EVE, SNAKE and APPLE red herring for me getting that wrong at first.\n\nNo more drama. It was all pretty straightforward from there. I got the greens then the blues no problem.\n\nI should have at least recognized the performers in the purples but alas, I did not. They refer to Fiona APPLE, Sheryl CROW, Donna SUMMER (who won for \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d which is more of a disco song, I'd say) and Tina TURNER.\n\nCrow, Turner and Pat Benatar each won this Grammy category four times before it was rightfully merged with the male equivalent into the Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance category (which itself was discontinued).\n\nAnyway, I am into triple digits with a Connections streak for the first time ever! I don't care that I got here without getting a perfect game at the end.\n\nIt feels like a nice little achievement to reach this point for the first time, especially after only looking up things once on this run (I had to Google those types of penguins a few weeks ago!). Anyway, for the record, here's how I fared with this one:\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it for today\u2019s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog tomorrow for hints and the solution for Friday\u2019s game if you need them.\n\nP.S. I'm gonna have to go with a song from one of the performers in the purple group. I really love \"Soak Up The Sun\" by Sheryl Crow. It's such a great summer song and it has a nice message about having a positive attitude.\n\nSomewhat ironically, I spent pretty much an entire summer listening to C'mon, C'mon (the album this is song is from), Come Away With Me by Norah Jones and Audioslave's self-titled debut while staying inside and playing a video game with my friends.\n\nI\u2019m gonna try to do a better job of taking the song\u2019s title to heart this summer (remember to wear sunscreen and take other heat precautions!):\n\nHave a great day! Stay hydrated! Call someone you love!\n\nPlease follow my blog for more coverage of NYT Connections and other word games, and even some video game news, insights and analysis. It helps me out a lot!

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.\nIt's playable for free via the NYT Games site on desktop or mobile.\n\nNYT Connections\n\nContributor\n\nJohnny is a freelance pop culture journalist who has been writing about the internet, music, football and famous people since the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye.

This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers.\u201d\n\nHow Have Other Countries Reacted To The Tariff Increase?\n\nEarlier this week, Olaf Gill, the European Commission\u2019s spokesperson on trade said: \u201cWe strongly regret the announced increase of steel tariffs from 25% to 50% by the U.S. We believe that this decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses.\u201d Gill said EU trade officials are set to meet their U.S. counterparts on Wednesday and if no resolution is reached \u201cboth existing and possibly additional\u201d EU countermeasures will \u201cautomatically take effect on July 14th or earlier.\u201d Canada, which is the largest foreign supplier of both steel and aluminum to the U.S., also criticized the move, calling it \u201cunlawful and unjustified.\u201d. A spokesperson from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s office told CTV News: \u201cCanada\u2019s new government is engaged in intensive and live negotiations to have these and other tariffs removed as part of a new economic and security partnership with the United States.\u201d\n\nHow Have Industry Groups Reacted?\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s announcement last week, Kevin Dempsey, the President and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group, praised Trump\u2019s tariffs and said: \u201cLed by China, global steel overcapacity and production continues to grow, even as overall global steel demand is being impacted by the sharp downturn in the Chinese construction sector\u2026Given these challenging international conditions that show no signs of improvement, this tariff action will help prevent new surges in imports that would injure American steel producers and their workers.\u201d The president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, Robert Budway, however, expressed strong opposition to the move, saying: \u201cDoubling the steel tariff will further increase the cost of canned goods at the grocery store. This cost is levied upon millions of American families relying on canned foods picked and packed by U.S. farmers, food producers, and can makers.\u201d The Canadian trade group, Aluminum Association of Canada, said the tariffs put the \u201cNorth American supply chain security\u201d at risk and \u201cwill impact workers on both sides of the border and disrupt key sectors including defense, construction and automotive.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Raises Steel Tariffs To 50%\u2014Here Are The 21 Times He\u2019s Changed His Mind (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

Late on Tuesday, Trump signed an executive proclamation to implement, starting Wednesday, his announcement last week to increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that had been in place since March from 25% to 50%. The new tax went into effect at 12:01 a.m. \"We started at 25 and then after studying the data more, realized that it was a big help, but more help is needed. And so that is why the 50 is starting tomorrow,\" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said at a steel industry conference on Tuesday. The increase applies to nearly all trading partners, with Britain the only exception, since it is the only country so far that has reached a preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. during a 90-day pause on a wider array of U.S. tariffs. Steel and aluminum imports from the U.K. will continue to be taxed at 25% until at least July 9. TRUMP ADMIN SEEKS COUNTRIES&apos; BEST OFFERS AHEAD OF TARIFF DEADLINE About a quarter of all steel used in the U.S. is imported, and the increased tariffs will hit strong U.S. trading partners Canada and Mexico particularly hard, Census Bureau data shows. The two U.S. neighbors rank number one and three, respectively, in steel shipment volumes to the U.S. Canada is even more impacted by the aluminum duties as the top exporter to the U.S. by far at roughly twice the rest of the top 10 exporters&apos; volumes combined. Prime Minister Mark Carney&apos;s office said Canada was \"engaged in intensive and live negotiations to have these and other tariffs removed.\" Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard emphasized that the tariffs were unsustainable and unfair, especially given that Mexico imports more steel from the U.S. than it exports to the country. \"It makes no sense for the United States to levy a tariff on a product in which you have a surplus,\" he said, adding that Mexico would seek an exemption from the increase. The U.S. receives about half of its aluminum from foreign sources. US ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECAST CUT SHARPLY DUE TO HIGHER TARIFFS The tariff increase shook the market for steel and aluminum this week, but particularly for aluminum, which has seen price premiums more than double so far this year. With little current capacity to boost domestic production, import volumes are likely to remain steady unless the price increases undercut demand. The White House also wants trading partners to submit their proposals on Wednesday for deals that might help them avoid Trump&apos;s \"Liberation Day\" tariffs from taking effect next month. Officials have been in active talks with several countries since Trump announced a pause on those tariffs, but the deal with Britain is the only one reached so far. But even that agreement is more of a preliminary framework for more talks. The Trump administration is now eager to reach more deals, with just five weeks until the tariffs take effect.

Economists warn that the latest tariffs will significantly squeeze the wallets of both companies and shoppers alike.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tariff rate on imported steel and aluminum now?\n\nSteel and aluminum imports are currently taxed at 25% \u2014 a rate that both metals have faced across the board since March 12 when Trump\u2019s order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum\u2019s levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes went into effect.\n\nThat\u2019s about to double. In a proclamation issued Tuesday, Trump confirmed that the U.S. will begin taxing nearly all steel and aluminum imports at 50% after the clock strikes midnight Wednesday. Steel and aluminum from the U.K., meanwhile, will continue to be levied at 25% due to a recent trade deal.\n\nWhy is Trump raising these tariffs?\n\nTrump says it\u2019s all about protecting U.S. industries. He reiterated that argument on Friday, when he first announced the 50% tariff during a visit with steelworkers in Pennsylvania, where he also discussed a \u201cplanned partnership\u201d between U.S. Steel and Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel.\n\nIn his speech at U.S. Steel\u2019s Mon Valley Works\u2013Irvin Plant in suburban Pittsburgh, Trump said that the tariff hike would \u201cfurther secure the steel industry in the U.S.\u201d Shortly after, he took the same tone when sharing plans to also raise tariffs on imported aluminum.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s proclamation, Trump also said that the higher tariffs would ensure that imported steel and aluminum would \u201cnot threaten to impair the national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my judgment, the increased tariffs will more effectively counter foreign countries that continue to offload low-priced, excess steel and aluminum in the United States,\u201d he said in the proclamation.\n\nHow is the industry responding?\n\nWhile some analysts have credited the tariffs Trump imposed during his first term with strengthening domestic production of steel and aluminum, many others have warned that stark new levies can make it difficult for the industry to adjust.\n\nSome organizations representing metal workers also note that tariffs aren\u2019t the only solution needed to boost U.S. manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWhile tariffs, used strategically, serve as a valuable tool in balancing the scales, it\u2019s essential that we also pursue wider reforms of our global trading system,\u201d David McCall, international president of the United Steelworkers union said in a statement, noting that work must be done \u201cin collaboration with trusted allies\u201d like Canada \u2014 the top exporter of steel and aluminum to the U.S. \u2014 to help \u201ccontain the bad actors.\u201d\n\nMatt Meenan, vice president of external affairs at the Aluminum Association, added that the trade group \u201cappreciates President Trump\u2019s continued focus on strengthening the U.S. aluminum industry,\u201d but that \u201ctariffs alone will not increase U.S. primary aluminum production.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need consistent, predictable trade and tariff policy to plan for current and future investment,\u201d Meenan said.\n\nWhat kinds of products could be impacted by heightened steel and aluminum tariffs?\n\nA range of businesses that rely on foreign-made steel and aluminum have already begun feeling the impacts of Trump\u2019s previously-imposed levies. But the latest anticipated hikes could drive up costs even more.\n\nSteel and aluminum are used in a range of products like washing machines, consumer electronics and cars. Much of the auto industry relies on a global supply chain. And even if you aren\u2019t in the market to buy a new vehicle, repairs could involve parts that use imports of either metal, driving up overall maintenance and ownership costs.\n\nIn the grocery aisle, steel and aluminum are ubiquitous in the packaging for many foods, including canned tuna, soup and nuts. Experts warn that hiking import taxes on these materials could led to higher grocery prices overall, further straining consumers wallets.\n\nThe aluminum and metal tariffs also carry wider implications for construction and transportation as a whole, as many key building parts and materials are made with these metals. Economists further warn of spillover impacts. Even if a product isn\u2019t directly packaged in steel or aluminum, there could be higher costs to build the shelf it\u2019s sold on, for example, or truck used to transport it to the store. And all of that could trickle down to the consumer down the road.\n\nIf foreign competition becomes \u201cpriced out\u201d due to these new tariffs, U.S. steel and aluminum producers may also find room to raise their own prices. As a result, even companies that don\u2019t buy these foreign metals could end up paying more.\n\nSteel prices have already climbed 16% since Trump became president in mid-January, according to the government\u2019s Producer Price Index. And as of March 2025, steel cost $984 a metric ton in the U.S., significantly higher than than in Europe ($690) or China ($392), per the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nWill there be any exceptions?\n\nThe new 50% tariff rate will apply to nearly all steel and aluminum coming into the U.S. from other countries. But the U.K., which recently reached a sweeping trade agreement with the U.S., will see an exception.\n\nAs part of trade deal reached between the two nations on May 8, the U.K. said that the U.S. had agreed to eliminate its current 25% duties on British steel and aluminum down to zero. That exemption had yet to go into effect in the weeks following \u2014 but in his proclamation issued Tuesday, Trump acknowledged that it was \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d to implement the deal, and would \u201caccordingly provide different treatment\u201d for these metals coming from the U.K.\n\nPer Trump\u2019s proclamation, the duty on British steel and aluminum will now stay 25%. But that rates could be adjusted starting on July 9 if the U.S. government determines that Britain has not complied with the framework.\n\nTrump\u2019s planned hikes for steel and aluminum tariffs for the rest of the world could spark retaliation from other trading partners. In response to levies imposed on these metals earlier in the year, for example, the European Union previously outlined countermeasures.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc later delayed those actions until July 14 in efforts to ease negotiations, but said on Monday that was preparing a list of measures to enact if a trade deal with the U.S. crumbles.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

The boosted levies went into effect at midnight EDT. Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on allies and adversaries alike -- including ones on imported steel and autos -- have strained U.S. ties with trading partners and sparked a flurry of negotiations to avoid the duties. And the pressure is mounting as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a 38-nation grouping of mostly developed countries, cut its global growth forecast on the back of the Trump levies. Trade, consumption and investment have been affected by the tariffs, OECD chief economist Alvaro Pereira earlier told AFP, warning that the U.S. economy will see the biggest repercussions. While some of Mr. Trump's most sweeping levies face legal challenges, they've been allowed to remain in place for now as an appeals process proceeds. Against that tense backdrop, the Paris-based grouping is holding a ministerial meeting that started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and European Union trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic were set to hold talks on the sidelines of the gathering, with the bloc seeking to stave off higher levies on its nations. Similarly, U.K. Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met with Greer Tuesday to try to avert the tariff hikes on steel and aluminum. Despite the doubling of those tariffs, imports from the U.K. will remain at 25 percent for now while both sides work out duties and quotas in line with the terms of their recently-announced trade pact. In their talks, Reynolds and Greer discussed a \"shared desire to implement\" the pact, including agreements on sectoral tariffs, as soon as possible, a U.K. readout said. But Mr. Trump's latest salvo raises tension with various partners. The EU has said it \"strongly regrets\" Mr. Trump's plan to raise metals tariffs, cautioning that it \"undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution\" with the U.S. The bloc added that it was ready to retaliate. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., has called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"illegal and unjustified.\" The Group of Seven advanced economies -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. -- is due to hold separate talks on trade on Wednesday. \"We need to come up with negotiated solutions as quickly as possible, because time is running out,\" German economy minister Katherina Reiche said Tuesday on the sidelines of OECD talks. French trade minister Laurent Saint-Martin added, \"We have to keep our cool and always show that the introduction of these tariffs is in no one's interest.\" Mexico will request an exemption from the higher tariff, Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said, arguing that it's unfair because the United States exports more steel to Mexico than it imports. \"It makes no sense to put a tariff on a product in which you have a surplus,\" Ebrard said. Mexico is highly vulnerable to Mr. Trump's trade wars because 80 percent of its exports go to the U.S., its main trading partner. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the Trump administration sent letters to trading partners to push for offers by Wednesday as a deadline approached. Besides imposing 10 percent tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners in early April, Mr. Trump had announced higher rates for dozens of economies including the EU and Japan as he sought to pressure countries to correct practices Washington deemed unfair. Those higher rates were paused for 90 days, but the halt is due to expire July 9. All eyes are also on rising tension around trade between Washington and Beijing. Mr. Trump has taken special aim at China this year, at one point imposing additional levies of 145 percent on Chinese imports andtriggering Beijing's counter tariffs of 125 percent on U.S. goods. Both sides agreed to temporarily de-escalate in May, but Mr. Trump accused China of violating the deal.Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social outlet that, \"I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\" The issue was China \"slow-walking the approval\" of critical mineral exports and rare earth magnets, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender told CNBC on Monday. But he maintained that Washington is making \"good progress\" overall in talks.", "summary": "A U.S. tariff on imports of steel and aluminum took effect Wednesday, doubling to 50% and casting a pall on a gathering of OECD ministers.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-steel-aluminum-doubled-50/", "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/04/bf73b4ce-cd05-4943-b838-01c07c545e72/thumbnail/1200x630/11d5df161a66c7c1f72730d03b4ca9f2/ap25153709771353.jpg?v=bf13c71e7181bf2db128edf777c4aecf", "video": "https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3797644_hls/master.m3u8", "publish_date": "2025-06-04 07:08:00", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.103}]}, {"news": [{"id": 327895138, "title": "Travis Kelce Celebrates Taylor Swift Buying Back Her Music Catalog: 'It's Finally Hers'", "text": "Travis Kelce is celebrating his girlfriend Taylor Swift buying back her music catalog.\n\n In a trailer for the upcoming episode of his New Heights podcast, Travis, 35, is seen dancing along to Swift's Red era hit \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" as guest Shaquille O'Neal plays the song on his phone.\n\n As the retired NBA star, 53, played the track, Kelce and his brother and podcast co-host Jason Kelce began to dance. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite song in the world, brother, I love it,\u201d O'Neal said, earning applause from the Kelce brothers.\n\n \u201cShout out to Tay Tay.

That staggering amount paid gave her the rights to her masters back.\nSo, that means she doesn\u2019t necessarily have to re-record Reputation and her self-titled debut album. Swift initially started the (Taylor\u2019s Version) series due to her dispute with her former record label, Big Machine Records.\nNow, she owns all of her music. It remains unclear what her next steps will be. Will she re-record Reputation or her debut album, or will she release something new?\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift\u2019s relationship\nKelce and Swift are one of the most high-profile couples in the world. They began dating in 2023 and have been going steady since.\nSpeculation began after Swift attended the Chiefs\u2019 Week 3 game against he Chicago Bears during the 2023 NFL season. They left the game together, and the rest is history.\nThey have supported each other\u2019s ventures since their relationship began. Swift attended 13 Chiefs games in 2023, including their Super Bowl 58 win over the San Fransisco 49ers. She was also present for several games in 2024, and she supported Kelce during his rough Super Bowl 59 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\nKelce has also been a big support of Swift\u2019s ventures. He went to a lot of Eras Tour shows while Swift was on the road. He was a mainstay of her European leg that took place during the summer of 2024.\nAdditionally, he went on stage with Swift during her June 23, 2024, concert in London, England.

Kennedy Airport in New York, one of the officials said. It was not immediately clear what Park was charged with or how he was connected to the investigation. Authorities believe the bomber died in the blast.\n\nFederal prosecutors are expected to release details at a news conference in Los Angeles. The arrest was first reported by NBC News. The law enforcement officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a criminal case that has not been publicly disclosed.\n\nThe attack on the fertility clinic was carried out by Guy Edward Bartkus, who was also killed in the explosion, according to the FBI. Officials said at the time they were investigating whether Bartkus had any help.\n\nAuthorities have described Bartkus as a member of the anti-natalist movement, a fringe group that opposes childbirth and population growth and believes people should not continue to procreate. Officials said he intentionally targeted the fertility clinic as an act of terrorism. He tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI says.\n\nThe blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.\n\nInvestigators haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.\n\nAuthorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus\u2019 hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base. Authorities haven\u2019t shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.\n\nA senior FBI official called the explosion possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d\n\nScott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.\n\nThose types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.\n\n\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d\n\nThe images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.", "summary": "Daniel Park, 32, of Kent, Washington, was arrested Tuesday night at JFK Airport.

PALM SPRINGS FERTILITY CLINIC BOMBER DOCUMENTED PLANS IN CHILLING ONLINE POSTS BEFORE ATTACK Last month, a 26-year-old suspect was identified as the perpetrator behind the bombing outside the American Reproductive Centers facility. Four people were injured and the primary suspect was killed in the blast. Surveillance footage and online postings show the primary suspect parking behind the building before ingesting drugs and detonating the explosive device. PALM SPRINGS BOMBING SUSPECT IDENTIFIED The primary suspect targeted the center in an attempt to destroy human embryos stored on-site after being motivated by a fringe \"pro-mortalism\" ideology movement. \"Pro-mortalism\" views human reproduction as immoral while believing death is preferable to life. ANTISEMITIC SHOOTING OF ISRAELI DIPLOMATS ADDS TO ALARMING RISE IN DOMESTIC TERRORISM The FBI has classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism while pointing to the suspect\u2019s ideological motivation as the cause for the violence. The organization previously confirmed none of the embryos were harmed in the attack. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I received a call saying there was a massive explosion that destroyed a couple of our buildings,\" the American Reproductive Centers wrote on Facebook after the attack. \"My biggest concern was obviously my staff and the embryos we have in storage,\" said Dr. Maher Abdallah, the clinic's director. \"Fortunately for us, our staff was unharmed and the IVF lab is intact, untouched, unharmed.

A reboot of the show, which Joss had already worked on, is set to start in August.\n\nJoss also had a recurring role on the television show \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series \u201cTulsa King\u201d in 2022.\n\nWhat was happening with Joss in the months before his death?\n\nJoss\u2019 childhood home, where he still lived, burned down in January. He lost all his belongings and his three dogs were killed in the blaze. A GoFundMe account had been set up to help Joss and his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, get back on their feet.\n\n\u201cWe may have lost our home, but not our hope. We\u2019re moving forward with love, humor, and a little elbow grease\u2026and we\u2019re incredibly grateful for every ounce of support,\u201d Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.\n\nBy the end of May, Joss was back in Texas, and on Saturday, he took part in a live music performance in Austin, located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of San Antonio.\n\nWho is accused of fatally shooting Joss?\n\nSigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 56, is accused by police of confronting Joss and his husband as they were checking their mail at the burned-down home Sunday night.\n\nIn a statement, de Gonzales alleged that when Ceja Alvarez opened fire, Joss pushed his husband out of the way and saved his life.\n\nCeja Alvarez was charged with murder. Court records indicate he was freed Monday on a $200,000 bond.\n\nCeja Alvarez\u2019s attorney, Alfonso Otero, did not immediately return a call or an email seeking comment.\n\nRobert Rios, a friend of Joss\u2019, told TV station KSAT that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.\n\nHow is Joss being remembered by friends, actors?\n\nActor Chris Pratt, who worked with Joss on \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d fondly remembered the actor in an Instagram story on Monday. Both actors had also appeared in the 2016 remake of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn. RIP Jonathan. Always such a kind dude,\u201d Pratt wrote. \u201cSad to see. Prayers up. Hug your loved ones.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post, San Antonio-based Our Lady of the Lake University, Joss\u2019 alma mater, called him \u201ca trailblazer in his field. His work and advocacy have left a lasting impact, and his legacy will continue to inspire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were more than a character \u2014 you were a storyteller, a dreamer, and a force that will never be forgotten,\u201d comedian Roy Alex Gomez, who was a friend of Joss, wrote in a Facebook post.", "summary": "While Joss\u2019 husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire, San Antonio police have said they\u2019ve found \u201cno evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss\u2019 murder was related to his sexual orientation.\u201d\n\n\nThe post What to know about fatal shooting of &#8216;King of the Hill&#8217; actor Jonathan Joss as co-stars pay tribute appeared first on Boston.com.", "url": "https://www.boston.com/culture/crime/2025/06/04/what-to-know-fatal-shooting-king-of-the-hill-actor-jonathan-joss/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Jonathan_Joss_Shooting_What_to_Know_09635-683f5cc7a349a-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-04 12:57:06", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.122}]}, {"news": [{"id": 328023062, "title": "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader rejects \u2018arrogant\u2019 US nuclear deal proposal", "text": "Iran\u2019s supreme leader on Wednesday blasted the US as \u201carrogant\u201d as he effectively rejected a revised nuclear deal that would allow Tehran to continue low-level uranium enrichment after it is signed.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei argued that abandoning uranium enrichment was \u201c100%\u201d against the country\u2019s interests and \u201ccan do spirit\u201d \u2014 as he ripped a central US demand amid talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cThe proposal that the Americans have presented is 100% against our interests\u2026 The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear program.

Whether Iran would have to entirely give up its enrichment program remains unclear, as Axios reported that Iran would be able to enrich uranium up to 3% purity for some time.\n\nA failure to get a deal could see tensions further spike in a Middle East already on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIran\u2019s long-ailing economy could enter a free fall that could worsen the simmering unrest at home.

And it has made officials in Washington increasingly nervous about other choke points where China could squeeze the United States, including pharmaceuticals or shipping.\n\nIn recent weeks, the airplane industry has emerged as both a weapon, and a victim, in this fight.\n\nThe jet engine technology that powers airplanes, and the navigation systems that control them, largely come from the United States, developed by companies like General Electric. In China\u2019s quest to build a viable competitor to Boeing, for example, it has had to source engine technology from GE Aerospace.\n\nBut a jet engine also cannot be made without China. Minerals that are processed there are essential for special coatings and components that help the engine operate smoothly at high temperatures, as well as other uses.\n\nBeijing restricted exports of those minerals, known as rare earths, in April after President Trump began imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe move has threatened to shutter what is left of advanced manufacturing in the United States \u2014 including the work done by many defense contractors. In May, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets it needed to build cars.\n\nThe United States responded with its own tech restrictions. Last week, U.S. officials suspended some licenses that allowed American companies to ship airplane technology to China, as well as others related to biotechnology and semiconductors, people familiar with the move say.\n\nAt the same time, officials in the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior and the National Security Council are accelerating efforts to find more domestic supplies of rare earths, including considering U.S. government funding for new mines and processing facilities, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nBut any such efforts could take years to come to fruition. On average, it has taken the United States 29 years to develop a single mine, according to statistics from S&P.\n\nThe Trump administration is also weighing further actions. It has been considering including major Chinese chipmakers, as well as units of Chinese technology giants like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, on a so-called entity list that prohibits them from engaging in trade with the United States, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe supply chain battle has been years in the making. And both countries have been trying to guard against the other\u2019s control of strategic goods by diversifying their own sources of supply.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump levied tariffs on China during his first term, many American companies established factories in countries outside of China, including Vietnam and Mexico. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, set out to make his country less reliant on foreign sources of energy and technology by pumping huge investments into factories making semiconductors, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nEven so, the economies remain deeply integrated, an intractable reality as hundreds of billions of dollars in trade flow across the Pacific each year. While both countries are resolved to reduce their dependencies on the other for national security reasons, doing so will be expensive and painful.\n\nSince 2022, for example, the United States has been steadily expanding a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and stop the technology from flowing to China. The rules have been aimed at restricting China\u2019s access to artificial intelligence and advanced computing needed to augment its military. But they have been met with fierce resistance from an industry that sees China as an important source of revenue.\n\nThe United States has extended these export controls around the world, even forbidding companies in other countries from selling products to China if they use American parts, technology or software to manufacture them. While some foreign governments have bristled at these rules, many have fallen in line.\n\nThis system rests on the idea that the United States should be the sole global power whose rules other countries need to abide by. But for China, rare earth minerals are a way to challenge the American assertion of dominance.\n\nBeijing set up a licensing system that allows it to monitor and approve sales of rare earths, and magnets made from them, to companies worldwide. When Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on China to 145 percent in April, Beijing responded by targeting shipments of rare earths, including pausing many of them.\n\nIn May, American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva to try to defuse their trade tensions. The Trump administration had several reasons to try to strike a truce. Companies had been warning of the risk of empty store shelves later this year because of plummeting imports from China, and stock and bond markets were flashing warning signs. But it was China\u2019s rare earth restrictions that appeared to put the most pressure on the United States to reach a resolution.\n\nNegotiators agreed in Geneva to lower tariffs. As part of the deal, China said it would \u201csuspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April,\u201d according to a joint statement.\n\nU.S. officials say Chinese shipments have yet to return to their previous levels. During an appearance on CNBC on Friday, Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative, said that the Chinese were \u201cslow-rolling their compliance\u201d and that American officials \u201chaven\u2019t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump was more blunt. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, he wrote that China had \u201cTOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d adding, \u201cSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusation in a briefing Tuesday, saying that China had \u201cearnestly implemented\u201d the consensus reached in Geneva. Chinese officials say it is the United States that broke the deal, including by issuing a notice saying that the use of chips made by Huawei, the Chinese technology firm, anywhere in the world violated U.S. law.\n\n\u201cThe U.S., without any factual basis, has smeared and accused China, imposed export controls on chips, suspended sales of chip design software to China and announced the cancellation of Chinese student visas \u2014 extreme measures that severely undermine the Geneva Consensus and harm China\u2019s legitimate rights and interests,\u201d Mr. Lin said.\n\nWhile some U.S. auto and electronics makers have recently received licenses from China for mineral shipments, the uncertainty and continued backlog of requests for the products are continuing to make companies nervous. China had also appeared to be giving preference to European companies over American ones.\n\nThe tensions are spilling over into other aspects of the United States\u2019 diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration has also proposed plans to \u201caggressively revoke\u201d visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Communist Party.\n\nSo far, it is unclear how the tensions can be defused. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Monday that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would likely speak in a call this week. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he had \u201cno information to offer\u201d on the call.\n\nDaniel H. Rosen, the co-founder of Rhodium Group, a research company, said that Beijing recognized years ago that rare earths would be central to advanced technologies and subsidized the build-out of those supplies. The United States, he added, \u201chorribly underestimated\u201d the demand for them.\n\nChina mines 70 percent of the world\u2019s rare earths, but it does the chemical processing for 90 percent of them. The country also makes more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s batteries, more than 70 percent of its electric cars, and about half of the world\u2019s steel, iron and aluminum, according to data from the International Energy Agency.\n\nSecuring an alternative supply would likely require the United States to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, Mr. Rosen said, and cooperation with global partners who were willing to work to set up supply chains outside of China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nWhile some shipments of minerals have restarted, many U.S. industries remain anxious about shortages of supplies. Paul Triolo, a partner at Albright Stonebridge Group, said the Chinese licensing system was cumbersome and that there had been a notable drop in shipments of critical minerals since the start of April, when Mr. Trump first issued astronomical tariffs on China.\n\nMr. Triolo said the United States had no choice except to negotiate with Beijing on the issue, as well as set up a long-term strategy with other countries to reduce its dependence on China over the next five to seven years.\n\n\u201cThis problem is deep and long lasting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not go away, or be easily solved.\u201d\n\nChris Buckley, Keith Bradsher and Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting and research.", "summary": "Experts said the move, which did not offer explicit guidance to hospitals, could discourage doctors from performing emergency abortions in states that ban or restrict them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/03/us/trump-news", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/03/multimedia/03trump-news-promo830p/03trump-news-header8p-fzvq-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-04 00:58:44", "author": "Amy Harmon,Ana Swanson,Benjamin Mullin,Catie Edmondson,David E.

Catcher Hunter Goodman, one of the lone bright spots so far, led the way with three RBIs.\nGoodman came through again for the Rockies on Tuesday, hitting a game-winning homer in the eighth inning. Colorado pitching held on for a 3-2 win in which their bullpen threw six scoreless innings. Their 162-game pace moved from 24.7 to 29.2 with the two wins. While this does not exactly put them in the playoff race, it\u2019s good for the team to feel some sort of momentum.\nThe Rockies were not trying to be good this year. Their one big contract, Kris Bryant, has been an unmitigated disaster. Their pitching is miserable, which is par for the course in Denver, and their young players are not blossoming. Still, they fired manager Bud Black after the dreadful start.\nThe National League West is going to be a gauntlet, with four teams fighting for playoff appearances. That means the Rockies are going to be a punching bag all season long. If they can become a spunky team, maybe they\u2019ll win some games that change the outcome of the season. But until then, the 2024 White Sox better watch out. Their record of 121 losses in a season is in danger.", "summary": "The Colorado Rockies heard the noise. Everyone pointed and laughed when Colorado hit 50 losses before getting their tenth win. They heard everyone say that golfer Scottie Scheffler had as many wins as they did from May 2 to June 1.

Sell or merge, that is. That has been a recurring question about U.K. TV giant ITV and its ITV Studios arm. One of the long-rumored potential buyers or merger partners is independent production giant Banijay Entertainment (Peaky Blinders, Black Mirror, Big Brother, Survivor, MasterChef). So it was no wonder that Banijay CEO Marco Bassetti was confronted with the ITV question at the inaugural SXSW London during a Wednesday appearance. \n\n Banijay has been reported to have been considering a possible takeover play for U.K. TV giant ITV, or its ITV Studios production business. Such a deal would bring together two of Europe\u2019s largest TV production companies. ITV\u2019s studio division has previously also attracted interest from such companies as RedBird IMI and its production giant All3Media, as well as private equity groups.\n\n \u201cNo, well\u2026,\u201d Bassetti said in response to a question about whether such a deal was in the works. He added that he wanted to speak rather about consolidation in general today.\n\n Asked by reporters after the session if these comments on stage meant a definite \u201cno\u201d to an ITV Studios deal, Bassetti declined to comment.\n\n But it is understood that Banijay has no immediate plans for an acquisition and that there are currently no discussions taking place about a potential deal.\n\n On stage, Bassetti had highlighted the benefits of size. \u201cTo be honest with you, we are living in a world where consolidation and scale are really important,\u201d he said, sharing that a few years ago, the firm had been afraid to be seen as \u201ctoo big, too powerful.\u201d But now, more consolidation is beneficial to industry players that need hit content, intellectual property, and production budgets in line with audiences\u2019 expectations, he concluded.\n\n The Banijay boss also addressed the role of AI in the media and entertainment industry, citing the need for \u201cvery strict rules in order to defend creativity,\u201d summarizing his team\u2019s role this way: \u201cHow can you defend the creative \u2026 from AI.\u201d The company tries \u201cto be transparent as much as possible,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWhen you are working for premium content, AI has a relative impact.\u201d\n\n Wednesday\u2019s session, entitled \u201cBuilding a Powerhouse,\u201d took place at the Rich Mix cinema and art hub in the Shoreditch neighborhood of the British capital and was part of the festival\u2019s first-ever European edition of SXSW.\n\n On the SXSW London stage, Bassetti was in conversation with Jordan Schwarzenberger, the manager of YouTube stars The Sidemen and co-founder of agency Arcade Media.\n\n The popularity of The Sidemen, famed for their videos of challenges, sketches, and video game commentaries across their YouTube channels, has continued to rise. Late last year, Netflix green-lit a second season, as well as a U.S. version, of the popular Sidemen reality series Inside. It features influencers and reality stars confined to a house for a week, vying for a million pounds ($1.26 million) prize.\n\n Bassetti asked Schwarzenberger about competition from the likes of MrBeast and potential concerns that YouTube could change its terms of trade to the detriment of The Sidemen. \u201cThe group dynamic is what\u2019s kept them going for that long,\u201d he said about The Sidemen. \u201cI think [regarding] MrBeast, with all credit to somebody who can handle 400 million subscribers on their shoulders and have it all on their back and all on their face and reputation, the instinct for creators has often been to put their face forward for everything. I think there\u2019s a world coming potentially when MrBeast produces [through] MrBeast Studios, and the channel becomes a platform without him.\u201d\n\n He added: \u201cThe way that he\u2019s built that actually is that he\u2019s not as integral to the success of the channel as maybe the instinct would seem. He could have other hosts on that platform. \u2026 With Beast Games, there\u2019s no reason why that can\u2019t transcend into something which doesn\u2019t have him hosting it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as integral to that format.\u201d\n\n Streamers give creators something that they don\u2019t have. \u201cGlobal editorial reach\u201d and push thanks to Netflix, something that \u201cYouTube cannot give,\u201d was a key reason for The Sidemen to strike a deal with the streaming giant, Schwarzenberger said. \n\n How about MrBeast\u2019s Amazon deal? Schwarzenberger argued that it is all about money. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to get any more audience on Amazon than he\u2019s going to get on his channels. He has 400 million subscribers \u2013 huge,\u201d he highlighted. \u201cBut [it is] to have 100 million [in money] to play with, even he doesn\u2019t have that in liquid cash to put into a show. So, Amazon can provide, you know, Bezos money and give him the funds to go and buy an island.\u201d\n\n SXSW London runs through June 7.

The two-child policy was not universally enforced, though members of the Communist party could face sanctions.\n\nAuthorities are now searching for ways to boost families, as Vietnam\u2019s birthrate fell to a record low of 1.91 children per woman in 2024, which is below replacement level.\n\nOfficials fear the trend could lead to an ageing society, creating labour shortages, putting pressure on social welfare systems and threatening the country\u2019s economic growth plans.\n\nBirthrates are especially low in urban centres, such as Ho Chi Minh City, where the rising cost of living was identified as barrier for young families. Its birthrate fell to 1.32 in 2023.\n\nLocal provinces are offering various rewards and subsidies to encourage couples to have children. This includes certificates of merit and a financial reward of about 1m dong (\u00a328) for women who have two children before the age of 35. Some provinces, such as Tien Giang in southern Vietnam, were also giving 30m dong to communes and wards in which 60% of couples of childbearing age had two children across three consecutive years, state media reported. Birthrates in the province are still falling, however.\n\nThe national birthrate of 1.91 children per woman recorded in 2024 was down from 2.11 children per woman in 2021, 2.01 in 2022 and 1.96 in 2023. Neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, have similar trends.\n\nIn Japan, the government released figures on Wednesday showing the number of births in 2024 had fallen below 700,000 for the first time on record.\n\nVietnam appeared to relax its two-child policy in 2003, but this was reversed in 2008.\n\nVietnam is also trying to tackle an imbalance in its sex ratio, driven by a historical preference for boys. On Tuesday the ministry of health proposed tripling a current fine to $3,800 \u201cto curb foetal gender selection\u201d, according to state media.\n\nThe gender ratio at birth, though improved, remains skewed at 112 boys for every 100 girls.\n China ended its strict \u201cone-child policy\u201d in 2016 and in 2021 permitted couples to have three children, though its population fell for the third year running in 2024.\n\n AFP contributed to this report.", "summary": "Authorities seek to increase number of births amid fear ageing society could threaten economic growth plans\n\nVietnam has scrapped a longstanding policy limiting families to two children, as the communist-run country grapples with a declining birthrate.\n\nState media announced on Wednesday that couples could make their own decisions about how many children to have, and how much time to wait between births, reversing a decades-old preference for one- or two-child families.\n\nAFP contributed to this report.\n\n Continue reading...", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/vietnam-two-child-policy-end-falling-birthrate", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c7660fab0dc8c43e0897a5971508d63dc3f46e/0_0_4233_3386/master/4233.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-04 11:30:09", "author": "Rebecca Ratcliffe", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.231}, {"id": 328088590, "title": "Vietnam Ends Two-Child Policy to Tackle Falling Birth Rates", "text": "Vietnam has abolished its long-standing two-child policy to tackle concerns about declining birth and fertility rates.The National Assembly Standing Committee approved a new regulation lifting the restriction, permitting couples to freely choose the timing, number, and spacing of their children on Tuesday, state media reports.Why It MattersThe fertility rate in Vietnam, Southeast Asia's third-most-populous nation, has fallen to 1.91 births per woman in 2024, according to the Vietnam General Statistics Office.This is well below the replacement threshold of 2.1 needed to maintain the population size.Vietnam's Two-Child Policy: Origins and PurposeVietnam introduced its two-child policy in 1988 to curb rapid population growth, when the average woman had more than four children.The law restricted most families to one or two children, with exceptions in special cases.Enforcement was stricter for Communist Party members, who faced penalties including warnings, reduced bonuses, or dismissal from positions for violations.What To KnowVietnam's decision to scrap its two-child policy followed a steady decrease in birth rates since 2022, when the fertility rate dropped to 2.01 and declined again to 1.93 in 2023. Health officials have expressed concern that the nation's population of nearly 100 million may begin to contract by mid-century. Authorities have also cited gender imbalances and the ongoing shift toward a \"super-aged society,\" with projections that over 20 percent of Vietnamese will be age 65 or older by 2049.Under the new regulation, all families\u2014regardless of Party membership\u2014can now choose freely how many children to have and when.Vietnam's policy shift aligns with recent moves in other Asian countries also experiencing plunging fertility rates and rapid aging.China saw a slight uptick in its birth rate in 2024, attributed mainly to cultural factors such as the Year of the Dragon, despite wide-ranging pro-natal measures and the end of restrictive family policies. Meanwhile, the country's overall population has continued to shrink for the third consecutive year.Japan, facing a decades-long population decline and with nearly 30 percent of its population over age 65, is preparing to make childbirth free as early as April 2026.The Japanese government proposes that public health insurance cover all delivery costs nationwide, attempting to alleviate financial burdens on families. What People Are SayingThe United Nations Population Fund says: \"Vietnam is in the period of population aging. The process of population aging is progressing rapidly, caused by mortality and fertility declines, and life expectancy at birth increase and that transition from an 'aging' to an 'aged' population will occur within just 20 years.\"What Happens NextThe Vietnamese Ministry of Health is expected to submit a new population law to the National Assembly in 2025, aimed at sustaining fertility rates near replacement level while monitoring the ongoing demographic transition and the effects of the relaxed family planning rules.", "summary": "The move responded to a record-low birth rate that has persisted below population replacement levels for three years,", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/vietnam-two-child-policy-birth-rates-2080941", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2656747/vietnam-birth-rate.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-04 15:49:38", "author": "Jordan King", "authors": ["Jordan King"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.096}]}, {"news": [{"id": 327883448, "title": "Couple suffering amid tragic loss of grandchild", "text": "DEAR ABBY: We recently suffered the loss of our first grandchild.

If you\u2019re looking to watch it live on a free channel, you\u2019re one of millions of tennis fans. The tournament is typically broadcast on premium channels.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a free channel that streams the French Open, including this match. This will let you tune in for free, enjoy the Clash of the Titans, and not lose a cent. In this guide, we\u2019ll explain everything you need to know about it.\n\nWhich Free Channel Is Broadcasting Zverev \u2013 Djokovic Live?\n\nWatching Zverev vs Djokovic for free online is possible on 9Now.\n\n9Now is an Australian on-demand streaming service. It allows you to stream multiple TV channels that belong to the 9Now brand. As you might know, 9Now broadcasts the entire Roland Garros live, in Full HD and English commentary.\n\nThis, in turn, means it\u2019ll cover the highlight of the event, i.e., Zverev vs Djokovic. Please note that you\u2019ll also need a free account on 9Now to watch the match. The problem with 9Now is availability. Australians abroad won\u2019t be able to access it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you already have an account. It\u2019s the same.\n\nOnce you\u2019re abroad, 9Now will show you a geo-restriction message. It implies that you\u2019re outside Australia and, therefore, can\u2019t access the content you want. Fortunately, 9Now can be unblocked abroad with a simple trick.\n\nHow to Unblock 9Now Outside Australia\n\nNow, we come to the nitty-gritty of this guide.\n\nPeople more intelligent than us have already found ways to access this channel anywhere. They used a VPN, in particular NordVPN, to unblock 9Now. NordVPN, being the most popular option, offers hundreds of servers in Australia.\n\nVPNs work by altering your IP address. In turn, they make you appear somewhere else online. If a user connects to a VPN server in Australia, they\u2019re assigned an Australian IP.\n\nThis unblocks all Australian TV channels everywhere.\n\nNordVPN doesn\u2019t only let you do that. It\u2019s a premium service with 10 Gbps server ports, unrestricted bandwidth, and industry-leading speeds. As a result, it\u2019s a frequent choice for watching sports in Full HD or even Ultra HD.\n\nNordVPN is a paid VPN, but it boasts a 30-day money-back guarantee. It\u2019s a refund opportunity that allows you to watch Zverev vs Djokovic on a free channel and be reimbursed when the match ends. This makes the VPN free.\n\nAnother thing you can do is keep using the VPN and enjoy the entire French Open. Then, you can also receive a full refund and lose nothing. NordVPN works on all devices, making it easy to tune in to this event, even on the go.\n\nAre There Other Free Channels I Can Use?\n\nVery few free English-speaking channels broadcast the French Open, and by extension, this match is not available for free on them. You can opt for premium platforms, such as Sling TV or ESPN+, but they\u2019re priced ludicrously.\n\nYou can, however, access Zverev vs Djokovic on free channels, such as:\n\nServusTV, Austria\nRTBF, Belgium\nFrance TV, France\n\nAll three are 100% free, and most of them don\u2019t require an account, except for France TV. As you can guess, they broadcast the match in their respective languages. Moreover, they\u2019re also region-locked to their native countries.\n\nYou can, of course, use a VPN, but if you\u2019re an English speaker, you\u2019d be better off with 9Now. If you\u2019re currently in one of these countries, there\u2019s no need to use a VPN. You can catch up with the match in just a few seconds.", "summary": "This French Open quarterfinal promises to be electric.

I am hopeful.\u201d\n\nPer Miller\u2019s lawsuit, first reported by TMZ, it was during a second surgery in November 2020 that the catheter incident occurred.\n\n\u201cDr. Melamed, in particular, attributed her symptoms to post-surgical scar tissue and offered no further investigation, no imaging was ordered, including a failure to examine the site of the pain,\u201d the docs claim.\n\nMiller declared that she was cancer-free in 2019, per People, but the disease left her unable to walk and bound to a wheelchair.\n\nLewis, her lawyer, further alleges to Page Six, \u201cAs a paraplegic woman with a life sentence in a wheelchair, Abby lives with daily pain in the aftermath of her Burkitt Lymphoma diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThis is not just medical battery, it reflects a larger, devastating truth: women\u2019s pain is too often ignored or dismissed by the very professionals sworn to care for them.

He took the loss on Monday night but retired the side in order this time. That allowed the Dodgers to score the game-winning run on Freddie Freeman\u2019s RBI double in the bottom of the 10th and walk off with a 6-5 victory over the New York Mets on Tuesday night.\n\nThat gave the Dodgers something to celebrate after watching Clayton Kershaw labor for each of the 14 outs he recorded.\n\nFor most of his career, hitters were eager to swing early against Kershaw for fear of the wipe-out stuff they would have to deal with if he got two strikes on them.\n\nThings no longer come as easily for Kershaw. He got two strikes on eight of the first 12 batters he faced but struck out just one. Instead, he gave up costly hits on two-strike pitches and had to throw 58 pitches in the first three innings.\n\nWith one out in the first inning, he had Starling Marte down 0-and-2. Marte singled.\n\nAfter a wild pitch moved Marte into scoring position with two outs, Pete Alonso drove him in with an RBI single on a 1-and-2 slider from Kershaw.\n\nTwo innings later, Kershaw threw his fastest pitch of the season so far \u2013 a 91.2 mph fastball \u2013 on a full count to Juan Soto. Soto crushed it, launching it into the right field seats for a two-run home run.\n\nThat all but washed away the 4-1 lead the Dodgers had given Kershaw after the first inning.\n\nBack in the lineup for the first time since last Wednesday, Mookie Betts singled with one out and scored from first base when Freeman doubled into the right-field corner \u2013 showing no ill effects from the fractured toe that had sidelined Betts for four games.\n\nFreeman went to third when Mets second baseman Jeff McNeil mishandled the relay throw and then scored on a ground out. Muncy capped the four-run first inning with a two-run home run, his fourth homer in the past four games.\n\nWhile Muncy\u2019s bat has come to life over the past month, his glove still remains a problem.\n\nWith one out in the fifth inning, Kershaw walked Francisco Lindor on four pitches. He got Marte to hit a ground ball right at Muncy but the ball had some odd spin on it and went right through Muncy. Kershaw got Soto to pop out for the second out of the inning, but Alonso lined a slider to the wall in left-center for a game-tying double.\n\nThe go-ahead run was a time-release headache for Kershaw. Nimmo bounced a ground ball to Freeman and Kershaw raced Nimmo to first base, grabbing the feed from Freeman on the way. First-base umpire Jansen Visconti called Nimmo out, ending the inning. But the Mets challenged the call and replay review showed Nimmo reaching the bag just before Kershaw. The call was overturned, giving Nimmo a go-ahead RBI infield single and ending Kershaw\u2019s night after 4\u2154 innings.\n\nMets starter Tylor Megill retired 16 of 17 Dodgers batters following Muncy\u2019s home run in the first inning. A two-out double by Andy Pages in the fourth was their only hit until the eighth inning, when Betts followed a walk of Shohei Ohtani with his second single of the night.\n\nA wild pitch advanced Ohtani to third with the tying run. Freeman struck out and, with the infield in, Teoscar Hernandez bounced a grounder to Ronny Mauricio at third base. He threw home and Ohtani was tagged out in a rundown. Smith struck out to end the inning. But Muncy took Huascar Brazoban deep to tie the score in the ninth and Freeman drove in the game-winning run in the 10th.\n\nMore to come on this story.", "summary": "Clayton Kershaw lets an early lead get away, but Max Muncy\u2019s second homer of the night ties it late, and Freddie Freeman drives in the winning run with a 10th-inning double for a 6-5 victory.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/03/dodgers-rally-to-tie-the-game-in-9th-beat-mets-in-10th/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25155200656873.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-04 05:30:42", "author": "Bill Plunkett", "authors": ["Bill Plunkett"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.206}, {"id": 327927790, "title": "Dodgers rally in ninth, push past Mets in 10th", "text": "Freddie Freeman drove in the winning run with a 10th-inning double after Max Muncy tied it with a homer in the ninth as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied for a 6-5 victory over the visiting New York Mets on Tuesday.\n\nMuncy's second home run of the game came against Huascar Brazoban.\n\nAn inning later, Freeman hit a double to the warning track in left field against Jose Butto (2-1) to score automatic runner Tommy Edman from second base.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Muncy now has five home runs in four games, including a pair of multi-homer games in the stretch.

The Oilers will dread the possibility of falling behind the Panthers again, and Florida will need to be ready for the pace that Edmonton will bring from the drop of the puck. \n\nThat should create a more helter-skelter, frenetic pace to Game 1 than you\u2019d think you\u2019d see in such a high-pressure environment. \n\nYou\u2019d think that a back-and-forth affair would favor the Oilers, but it\u2019s the Panthers who should thrive in that kind of environment. \n\nFlorida can beat you in a number of ways, but the Cats are incredibly adept at keeping their composure amidst chaos. \n\nThey\u2019re not going to chase you around and try to force the issue, but will sit back and wait for their opportunity to hit on the counter. \n\nThey trust that Bobrovsky and their defense will keep them in the game until they can strike. \n\nGiven how I project this game to play out \u2014 with these teams trading chances and Florida coming out the better for it \u2014 why not build a same-game parlay correlated to that script? \n\nThe first leg is to back the Over 1.5 goals in the first period at -134. I think this thing flies off the handle early. \n\nWith that being the case, we\u2019ll also throw in the Over 6.5 goals, as a wide-open first period should lead to more of the same in the next 40 minutes. \n\nFrom there, we\u2019ll add Panthers -1.5 at +250. If this game is going to be full of chances, there\u2019s a good chance that it will be decided by multiple goals. \n\nBetting on the NHL? \n\nCheck out the best NHL betting sites\n\nRead our expert guide on how to bet on the NHL\n\nTo add some serious juice to this nearly 100/1 parlay, we\u2019ll add Anton Lundell (+400) as an anytime goal scorer for the Cats. \n\nLundell\u2019s line has been superb throughout the postseason, and he should get a favorable matchup with both coaches playing cat and mouse with Aleksander Barkov, McDavid and Draisaitl. \n\nFinally, we\u2019ll back McDavid to record Over 4.5 shots on goal at +320. McDavid leads the playoffs with 59 shots, and if things do go off the rails, he should have every chance to clear this mark. \n\nIf you wrap all five legs together in a same-game parlay, it would pay out 97/1. \n\nNot a bad way to start the Stanley Cup Final.", "summary": "The Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will renew acquaintances in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final on Wednesday evening.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2025/06/04/betting/stanley-cup-final-pick-oilers-vs-panthers-game-1-prediction-odds-best-bets/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/AP_Stanley_Cup_Oilers_Hockey_80498-0f014-0.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-06-04 13:00:00", "author": "Michael Leboff", "authors": ["Michael Leboff"], "language": "en", "category": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.291}, {"id": 328049136, "title": "NHL Predictions: Stanley Cup Final Game 1 Florida Panthers vs Edmonton Oilers", "text": "Welcome back to another NHL Predictions.

Don\u2019t forget to check out more NHL Predictions, as our writers continue this series throughout the 2025 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nNHL Predictions\n\nFlorida Panthers vs. Edmonton Oilers\n\nSeason Head-to-Head: Panthers 2-0 Oilers\n\nTime: 8:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)\n\nTV: TNT, TruTV, CBC, Sportsnet, TVAS; Max\n\nThe big day has finally arrived and we\u2019ve reached the 2025 NHL Stanley Cup Final. This round of NHL predictions takes a look at the opening game in the rematch of last year\u2019s championship series. Florida defeated Edmonton in seven games last season, but Game 1 will be at Rogers Place.\n\nThe Oilers will have the home-ice advantage. However, the Panthers have been road warriors this postseason with an 8-2 mark away from Sunrise, Fla. The Cats only losses away from home were against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round.\n\nEdmonton is looking to end its own (1990) and Canada\u2019s (1993) Stanley Cup drought. The Montreal Canadiens were last Canadian team to hoist the vaunted silver chalice. A whole country has put its faith in the Oilers.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the stats, storylines and matchups in this set of NHL predictions.\n\nThe Panthers Story\n\nFlorida took out the Carolina Hurricanes in five games to book its third straight appearance in the Cup Final. The Panthers have looked like the defending champions at many points in their third consecutive post-season.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky really locked in during the second round of the series. The Russian did have some struggles against the Maple Leafs at time. However, he looked like the goalie that played a massive hand in Florida\u2019s first championship.\n\nDepth-scoring has been something the Panthers have hung their hat on this post-season. Aleksander Barkov leads the team in points with 17, but 10 different players have at least 11 points heading into the Final.\n\nThe Oilers Story\n\nEdmonton is looking to get revenge from last year\u2019s Game 7 loss against Florida after taking down the Dallas Stars in five games. The Oilers had some nervy moments in the first round against the Los Angeles Kings. However, things turned around quickly for the defending Western Conference champions.\n\nStuart Skinner is seemingly locked in after some rough patches in the opening portion of the playoffs. Skinner can be a streaky goalie, but he seems to be playing well at this points.\n\nConnor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl are leading the way with 26 and 25 points, respectively. The team will be without Zach Hyman and will need to get depth scoring if the Oilers have designs on winning a Stanley Cup.\n\nThe Oilers are 6-1 at home while the Panthers are 8-2 away from home. Both teams are well-rested and there could be some rust going into this game. The opening part of the game could tell the story in this one.\n\nGoaltending and depth are in Florida\u2019s favour and that should carry it to a Game 1 win in a hostile environment.\n\nPrediction: Panthers win 4-2.\n\nProp Bets of the Night\n\nWe close out NHL predictions with some prop bets of the night. The over/under for this game is 6.5 and we feel the under gets the nod by a slight margin.\n\nAs for individual prop bets, go with Matthew Tkachuk to get a point in this game for the Panthers. On the Oilers\u2019 side of things, go with Evan Bouchard to get a power-play point in this game.\n\nPlease play responsibly. Check your local rules and age restrictions.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: The Pokemon Company)\n\nThe Switch 2 is officially out tomorrow, and with it, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are getting a free update to improve their performance on the new console, with improved draw distance to load in even more wild Pokemon, as well as a boosted frame rate, finally bringing the adventures to 60fps.\n\nConsidering how notoriously poorly Scarlet and Violet run on the original Switch \u2013 with problems like frame drops and stuttering still an issue over two years since launch \u2013 this is a massive deal, and the first gameplay footage and extended preview looks shown ahead of release have fans in a frenzy. Not only does everything look buttery smooth, but it remains that way even when embarking on Casseroya Lake.\nIf you've spent any time at all in Scarlet and Violet's Paldea region, you'll know why this is a big deal. While far from the only location in the games to experience performance issues, it's largely considered one of the worst \u2013 stuttering and considerable frame rate drops while traveling across the water are commonplace. Or, at least, they were on the OG Switch, because Nintendo has jumped at the opportunity to show off what exploring the lake looks like now.\n\nYou may like\n\nNintendo finally shows gameplay footage of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet on Switch 2, and the frame rate boost is honestly a lot nicer than I expected\n\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet's free Switch 2 update promises to steal hundreds more hours from me as shiny hunting looks easier than ever with more wild encounters\n\nBreath of the Wild's Korok Forest might actually hit 60fps on the Switch 2 re-release, and Zelda fans can't wait for \"an actual stable frame-rate\" in Hyrule's most infamous region\n\nAs one stunned fan puts it, \"the Casseroya Lake footage literally made me get up and stare at the screen like a 60-year-old father witnessing his football team score a goal on TV.\" Another adds that \"showing the notorious frame drop lake at a crisp framerate was such a power play,\" while one fan argues that \"this is the best possible advertisement they could have done for the Switch 2 oh my god.\"\n\nthe casseroya lake footage literally made me get up and stare at the screen like a 60 year old father witnessing his football team score a goal on tv https://t.co/zqoyQPyOoXJune 2, 2025\n\nAgain, it's not just a frame rate boost, as improved draw distance means a lot more wild Pokemon now populate the screen than ever before (potentially a huge boon for shiny hunters, might I add). Former Pokemon world champion Wolfe \"Wolfey\" Glick suspects that \"if you tried to put that many Pokemon in the lake on my Switch from 2017 I think it would actually explode.\"\nAll of these reactions were to the few short seconds of footage posted on the Nintendo Today app earlier this week, but since then, the owner of Pokemon news site Serebii, Joe Merrick, has shared even more from a preview event. His footage takes things to the next level, because that 60fps apparently remains consistent even in the rain, folks. \"It is so beautiful,\" Merrick adds.\n\nCasseroya Lake. In the rain.

Among those are Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, the most recent games in the Pok\u00e9mon series, and it looks like developer Game Freak has gone all out with the updates.A number of press previews for the Switch 2 updated version of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet went live overnight, and the game is looking and running significantly better than it did on the Nintendo Switch. Preview footage for the update shows the game running above 1080p, up from a dynamic 1080p on Switch 1, at a locked 60fps, more than double what was possible with the game on the Switch.Fans have also noticed that the spawn distance and number of spawns available on screen has significantly increased, with some saying the number is as high as 30, up from a hard limit of 16 on Switch.The news has come as a shock to fans who were expecting more modest upgrades from Game Freak. Many were expecting the update to lock the resolution to 1080p \u2013 it previously typically hovered at around 900p when docked \u2013 and a stable 30fps. The game on Switch had well-documented performance problems, including frequent frame drops below its 30fps target.The performance issues for Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet were immediately noticed at launch, with fans outraged by the state of the game. In addition to performance issues, the games frequently suffered from bugs and glitches, and Nintendo, the game's publisher, had to apologise for the state it launched in.Now, it looks like Game Freak has made good on the game, finally delivering acceptable performance and a much higher resolution.

Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns \u2b1b\ufe0f, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. \ud83d\udfe8 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. \ud83d\udfe9 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.\nYour second go should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above.\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures.

U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.The measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.In his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.Walker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201dAlso Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.RELATED STORY | 1 in 5 Americans get their news from social media influencers, study saysWhile siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.Matt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"RELATED STORY | Virginia enacts law limiting social media use for kids under 16 to one hour dailyA spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201dIn Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201dTotenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"Winkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted.

It was her third straight clean sheet. \n\nWhile Tullis-Joyce didn\u2019t face any shots on goal, it has been important for her to build connections with her teammates, Hayes said. \n\n\u201cWhen you play in goal for this team, your behaviors have to be that you wait for one moment, and you have to be alert to that. I can see the progress is being made in Phallon\u2019s game, and I\u2019m quite happy that she had a really quiet evening,\u201d Hayes said. \n\nJamaica, which has never beaten the U.S, started two sets of sisters \u2014 Allyson and Chantelle Swaby, and Kalyssa and Amelia Van Zanten. \n\nThe U.S. was coming off a 3-0 victory over China on Saturday in St. Paul, Minnesota. The national team was originally scheduled to play a pair of matches against China, but Chinese officials in April pulled out of the second game and Jamaica filled the spot. \n\nBefore the game, the United States honored Sauerbrunn, who retired from soccer late last year.\n\nThe St. Louis native, whose international career spanned 16 years, is a two-time Women\u2019s World Cup winner and an Olympic gold medalist. Fans, who received a bobblehead in her image, gave her a standing ovation and chanted her name in a pregame ceremony. \n\nSauerbrunn, who recently announced that she is expecting her first child with partner Zola Short, also served in her new role as a television commentator for the match. \n\nThe United States next plays a pair of matches against Ireland, the first on June 26 in Commerce City, Colorado, and the second on June 29 in Cincinnati.

This outing was just his sixth start since returning to the mound. He delivered six scoreless innings, showing sharp command and poise throughout.

In the fourth, Jos\u00e9 Altuve singled and stole second, but Skenes struck out Christian Walker and got Yainer D\u00edaz to ground out.\nSkenes pitched eight full innings.

Despite the loss, Skenes further cemented his reputation as one of the league\u2019s best young arms.\nMcCullers\u2019 dominant return and Walker\u2019s clutch blast proved to be the difference in a game ruled by elite pitching.

Dismissed at the time of its production as \u201cDisney\u2019s Folly,\u201d by the time it went into general release in 1938, it quickly became the highest grossing film of 1938, the highest grossing sound film of all time and held the record for the most successful animated movie of all time for the next 55 years. At the Academy Awards, Walt Disney was awarded an honorary, full-sized Oscar, along with seven miniature Oscars, symbolizing the dwarfs.\n\nIf you missed this new \u201cSnow White,\u201d now is your time to watch and weigh in. Will you feel that it\u2019s too tied to the animated original (or maybe not tied to that original film enough?). And will the surrounding controversies negatively impact your viewing experience?

The update adds a new questline, new recipes, rare fish to collect and display in your C.A.M.P., and of course, a chill new pastime that can be enjoyed anywhere across the map. Fishing can be unlocked through the new Casting Off questline, which can be accessed through a new location in the Mire known as Fisherman's Rest. The questline will give players the base-level fishing rod, which can then be upgraded through Tinker's Workbench. The fishing rod isn't an item that needs to be manually equipped; instead, just go up to any body of water and select the \"Fish\" command when it shows up on screen. Fishing isn't contained to just the new area. You can fish anywhere across the map with a handy mantra: If you can swim in it, you can fish in it. There are a number of fish to be caught in Fallout 76, from generic fish to regional fish that have differing levels of rarity from common to super rare. The rarest catch is a super-cute axolotl--there are twelve of them to be caught, with one unique axolotl available to be caught every month. You'll have to upgrade both your bait and your rod to have a chance at catching rarer fish, and the weather will play a part in what you can catch, too. Fish you catch can be eaten as is, broken down into Fish Bits that can be used in recipes, or saved and displayed in your C.A.M.P. with a new fish-display item. The Gone Fission season also adds a heap of new fishing-related items. Check out everything new in seasonal content here. While the fishing additions make up the majority of the latest patch, Bethesda is continuing with major combat balance changes first initiated in last year's Skyline Valley update.

The update adds a new questline, new recipes, rare fish to collect and display in your C.A.M.P., and of course, a chill new pastime that can be enjoyed anywhere across the map.\n\nFishing can be unlocked through the new Casting Off questline, which can be accessed through a new location in the Mire known as Fisherman's Rest.
