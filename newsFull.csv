225109966,Scottie Scheffler is a free man. Early on Friday_ May 17_ the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) placed Scheffler under arrest and charged him with four crimes_ which included assaulting a police officer to the second degree�a felony. However_ a report from Terry Meiners_ a radio personality from Louisville_ Kentucky_ indicates that police will drop these charges. This announcement comes six days after Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel addressed the media and released two videos that detailed the incident. Another press conference featuring Jefferson County Attorney Mike O�Connell and Scheffler�s defense attorney_ Steve Romines_ is set for Wednesday. Since this session with media is scheduled five days before Scheffler�s arraignment_ early indications pointed to prosecutors dropping this case altogether. It makes sense for them to do so_ considering the videos released made things look as if Scheffler did nothing wrong. Scheffler tried maneuvering around traffic and entering Valhalla�s front gates before his second-round tee time that morning. A tragic fatal accident had occurred earlier_ thus leading to the logjam and an increased police presence. But the two-time Masters champion did not realize that someone had lost their life. He only wanted to get to the course to warm up. Other PGA Tour players admitted to doing the same thing_ but Scheffler had a �big miscommunication� with the police. Given the time of day and the rainy conditions_ eyewitnesses on the scene_ namely ESPN�s Jeff Darlington_ who broke the story_ also reported how difficult it was to see. Another video released early Wednesday also included Scheffler�s perspective. Within that_ Scheffler initially did not realize that the officer directing traffic was a police officer. Nevertheless_ it looks as if everyone involved in this case can move on from the matter. Jack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation�s Playing Through.

225012756,Giant pandas are set to return to the National Zoo in Washington_ D.C._ by the end of the year_ officials announced Wednesday. China will send a new pair of giant pandas_ male Bao Li and female Qing Bao_ under a 10-year breeding and research agreement_ the zoo said in a press release. Both bears are 2 years old. �We�re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears_ including a descendent of our beloved panda family_ to Washington_ D.C._� the zoo�s director_ Brandie Smith_ said in a release. �This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact. Through this partnership_ we have grown the panda population_ advanced our shared understanding of how to care for this beloved bear and learned what�s needed to protect wild pandas and preserve native habitat.� Chinese ambassador Xie Feng is scheduled to make brief remarks on Wednesday morning. Smith and other zoo officials are set to address the media_ as well_ the zoo said in a press release. The announcement comes six months after the National Zoo�s three iconic pandas returned to China as a conservation agreement expired_ leaving just a few pandas in United States zoos. In February_ China announced plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. One of the bears headed to D.C. has family ties to the National Zoo�s panda family. Bao Li is the offspring of Bao Bao_ who was born at the National Zoo in 2013. That makes Bao Li the grandchild of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian_ the zoo said. The name means "treasure" and "energetic" in Mandarin Chinese. The female bear_ Qing Bao_ was born in China on Sept. 12_ 2021_ the zoo said. Her name means "green" and "treasure_" the zoo said. Giant pandas were a staple at D.C.�s National Zoo for over 50 years The National Zoo�s longstanding resident pandas_ Tian Tian and Mei Xiang_ departed D.C. last fall_ along with their youngest offspring_ Xiao Qi Ji_ who was born at the zoo in 2020. After an emotional goodbye_ the three went to new homes in the China Wildlife Conservation Association_ leaving the National Zoo's giant panda habitat vacant for the first time in decades. Pandas first arrived at the National Zoo in the 1970s and evolved into D.C.'s unofficial mascots. The black-and-white bears appeared on Metro cards_ street signs and statues around the District. The panda conservation program flourished after Tian Tian and Mei Xiang arrived 20 years ago. Mei Xiang gave birth to four surviving cubs_ Tai Shan_ Bao Bao_ Bei Bei and Xiao Ji Qi � the first panda in the U.S. born after his mother was artificially inseminated with frozen_ instead of fresh_ semen. The agreement keeping Tian Tian and Mei Xiang was extended several times. The panda program has always served as a gesture of friendship and a sort of soft diplomacy between China and the United States_ so the pullback of pandas at the National Zoo and other zoos in the United States caused some concern. Currently_ there are only four pandas in the country � all at Atlanta�s zoo. But in February_ news that China plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo signaled the return of panda diplomacy. Despite the links to U.S.-China diplomacy_ the negotiations are researcher-to-researcher and not based in politics_ Smith_ the National Zoo's director_ told News4 last summer. "We're a bunch of scientists; we're a bunch of animal people_" Smith said. "This is not a political conversation. This is absolutely a conversation between colleagues talking about_ what's best for the overall program_ and also_ what can be best for individual animals?" Want to know what's up for your weekend?

Neither incident merits his recusal_ he wrote. �I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request_� he wrote.

225031922,DETROIT (AP) � Nissan is urging the owners of about 84_000 older vehicles to stop driving them because their Takata air bag inflators have an increased risk of exploding in a crash and hurling dangerous metal fragments. Wednesday�s urgent request comes after one person in a Nissan was killed by an exploding front-passenger inflator_ and as many as 58 people were injured since 2015. �Due to the age of the vehicles equipped with defective Takata air bag inflators_ there is an increased risk the inflator could explode during an air bag deployment_ propelling sharp metal fragments which can cause serious injury or death_� Nissan said in a statement. Nissan said the �do not drive� warning covers certain 2002 through 2006 Sentra small cars_ as well as some 2002 through 2004 Pathfinder SUVs_ and 2002 and 2003 Infiniti QX4 SUVs. Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall or infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers_ and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available. �Even minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering_ gruesome injuries_� the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. �Older model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk_ as the age of the air bag is one of the contributing factors.� Nissan originally recalled 736_422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84_000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators. The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018_ the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra_ according to Nissan. The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators_ which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force_ blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia_ Australia and the U.S. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history_ with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata into bankruptcy. Honda_ Ford_ BMW_ Toyota and Stellantis and Mazda have issued similar �do not drive� warnings for some of their vehicles equipped with Takata inflators.
224779450,NEW YORK � Josh Gibson became Major League Baseball�s career leader with a .372 batting average_ surpassing Ty Cobb�s .367_ when Negro Leagues records for more than 2_300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project. Gibson�s .466 average for the 1943 Homestead Grays became the season standard_ followed by Charlie �Chino� Smith�s .451 for the 1929 New York Lincoln Giants. They overtook the .440 by Hugh Duffy for the National League�s Boston team in 1894. Gibson also became the career leader in slugging percentage (.718) and OPS (1.177)_ moving ahead of Babe Ruth (.690 and 1.164). �This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible_� baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. �Their accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson�s 1947 Dodger debut.� A special committee on baseball records decided in 1969 to recognize six major leagues dating to 1876: the National (which launched in 1876)_ the American (1901)_ the American Association (1882-1891)_ Union Association (1884)_ Players� League (1890)_ and Federal League (1914-1915). It excluded the National Association (1871-75)_ citing an �erratic schedule and procedures.� MLB announced in December 2020 that it would be �correcting a longtime oversight� and would add the Negro Leagues. John Thorn_ MLB�s official historian_ chaired a 17-person committee that included Negro Leagues experts and statisticians. �The condensed 60-game season for the 2020 calendar year for the National League and American League prompted us to think that maybe the shortened Negro League seasons could come under the MLB umbrella_ after all_� Thorn said. An updated version of MLB�s database will become public before the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants play a tribute game to the Negro Leagues on June 20 at Rickwood Field in Birmingham_ Alabama. Baseball Hall of Fame President Josh Rawitch said statistics on Cooperstown plaques would remain the same because they reflect the information available at the time of a player�s induction. Standards for season leaders is the same for Negro Leagues as the other leagues: 3.1 plate appearances or one inning for each game played by a player�s team. Gibson�s .974 slugging percentage in 1937 becomes the season record_ and Barry Bonds� .863 in 2001 dropped to fifth_ also trailing Mules Suttles .877 in 1926_ Gibson�s .871 in 1943 and Smith�s .870 in 1929. Bond�s prior OPS record of 1.421 in 2004 dropped to third behind Gibson�s 1.474 in 1937 and 1.435 in 1943. Willie Mays gained 10 hits from the 1948 Birmingham Black Barons_ increasing his total to 3_293. Minnie Minoso surpassed 2_000 hits_ credited with 150 for the New York Cubans from 1946-1948 that boosted his total to 2_113. Robinson_ who broke MLB�s color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers_ was credited with 49 hits with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs that increased his total to 1_567. Among pitchers_ Satchel Paige gained 28 wins that raised his total to 125. The committee met six times and dealt with issues such as when compiled league statistics didn�t make sense_ such as a league having more wins than losses and walks that were missing. Researchers had to identify whether players with the same name were one person or separate_ tracking dates of birth_ and identify people listed by nicknames. Documenting transactions and identifying ballparks in a time when neutral sites often were used is ongoing_ along with uncovering statistics for independent teams. Kevin Johnson and Gary Ashwill_ researchers who had spent nearly two decades helping assemble the Seamheads Negro Leagues Database_ were included in the project. Thorn estimated 72% of Negro Leagues records from 1920-1948 are included and additional research might lead to future modifications. Thorn said a four-homer game by Gibson in 1938 and a home run by Mays in August 1948 could not be included because complete game accounts have not been found. �Without a box score_ we can�t really balance the statistics_� Johnson said. �Those games are kind of in limbo at the moment.� Records include the first Negro National League (1920-31)_ Eastern Colored League (1923-28)_ American Negro League (1929)_ East-West League (1932)_ Negro Southern League (1932)_ second Negro National League (1933-48) and Negro American League (1937-48). Some game details were obtained from newspapers that covered the Black communities. Johnson said while complete accounts were found for about 95% of games in the 1920s_ coverage dropped off during the Great Depression in the 1930s and never fully recovered.

Here’s how it works.  Elden Ring Nightreign review  Nightreign isn't the Elden Ring co-op experience you'd expect_ but it's kind of brilliant anyway.  Tyler Colp   28 May 2025  (Image: © Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Our Verdict  Elden Ring Nightreign is just as confusing and abrasive as FromSoftware's other games_ but there's really nothing else like it.  PC Gamer's got your back  Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review_ to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.  Need to Know  What is it? A co-op action RPG battle royale hybrid set in the Elden Ring universe Release date May 30_ 2025 Expect to pay $40/£35 Developer FromSoftware Publisher Bandai Namco Reviewed on RTX 5090_ Intel Core i9 12900K_ 16GB RAM Multiplayer Yes Steam Deck Untested Link Official site In the fight against Elden Ring Nightreign's riff on Mothra_ I never expected it would eventually touch down and mount the head of its partner_ a giant stick bug with claws_ like a mech. For the rest of the fight they were operating in unison_ a kaiju cowboy with orbital lasers piercing the sky. That's a problem pesticide can't solve_ but_ as it turns out_ three guys with bows absolutely can.  There's nothing like fighting a boss in a FromSoftware game that is designed to be a joke with you as the punchline—and defying fate with your own ridiculous strategy. Elden Ring Nightreign is a game about losing a fistfight over and over until you luck or strategize your way into an opportunity to bring three guns. The harder you've been hit the more glorious the payback_ and Nightreign is a merciless bully. Even if you've played Elden Ring_ Nightreign will surprise you. Imagine the Lands Between as a stadium filled with familiar monsters and a team of three players as its contestants. It's an action RPG as a sport_ cranked up to two times speed_ and designed to be replayed every 30 minutes. Randomized loot and an ever-tightening battle royale-style circle apply constant pressure that you're only released from at the end of the match_ whether you survive or not.  You may like  Elden Ring Nightreign's story is told in part through playable memories_ so FromSoftware really is delivering lore through whacking things  The First Berserker: Khazan review – Smart soulslike combat and boss design despite somewhat samey missions  Elden Ring Nightreign PC performance analysis: A bare-bones console port with glitches a-plenty  Nightreign is the most peculiar game FromSoft has made since the '90s. It's also its most abrasive.  Even now after putting well over 30 hours into it_ I believe Nightreign is both a trend-defying remix of Elden Ring and also a pile of complete bullshit that I shouldn't have to deal with in the year 2025.  (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods I can't help but respect the fact that it works_ however. Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods_ and yet that is exactly what I've been doing in Nightreign. We've been "looting churches_" "clearing camps_" and "popping crab" for the past week. Some of my most heated_ frustrating moments—like when a boss "invaded" my run to steal entire levels from me before peacing out—were cooled by the fact that I was palling around Elden Ring like it was Fortnite. There were also plenty of times I was convinced that maybe Nightreign is actually a terrible idea. Elden Ring didn't need a time limit_ nor did it need a randomized loot system. The randomization often feels designed—or under-designed—just to screw you over. There's a difference between mistiming a dodge on a fatal attack and spending 10 minutes on a grueling boss fight because the map refused to cough up a holy weapon for a boss who is weak to holy. This game has optional events where you can spend half of a run fighting for a bonus reward that will be irrelevant to the final boss you've targeted for that session—or any boss for that matter. And the ability to meaningfully buildcraft is in constant tension with Nightreign's pace and its UI_ which obfuscates key information around damage scaling and weapon abilities. Do you know the difference between Dragon Communion Incantations and Dragon Cult Incantations? I don't either_ but you have five seconds to figure it out before the circle consumes you. Nightreign is kind of a mess. FromSoftware's inscrutable terminology and uneven balance makes the learning curve much steeper than it needs to be. Or maybe that's the beauty of it: A game not trying to entice you with daily login bonuses or battle passes_ but a language to learn over the course of hundreds of runs. In that way_ it emulates the joys of gaining acuity with any of the studio's other games. But that might also be why the structure of Nightreign falls apart for me. If you hated running back to a boss in Elden Ring_ try doing that with a whole-ass battle royale to survive on the way there. It's hard to enjoy the journey when the destination is the only thing you're meaningfully rewarded for. Each character in Nightreign can equip three Relics with passive benefits that range from unnoticeable (dexterity +2) to game-changing (item effects or healing flasks are shared with all players). Most of them are trash and will have little to no bearing on whether or not you can kill the final boss_ let alone reach them. But that's all that you get to take home after each run. Build-brained  Nightreign's major bosses tend to be extremely mobile_ so get ready to sprint a lot. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware) Nightreign wants you in it for the love of the game_ and while I can appreciate that in a sea of games that practically bribe you to keep playing_ it can also make the routine moments of a run kind of boring. Elden Ring has its punishing sections_ but there's always something else to do. In Nightreign_ you just fight bosses until you're strong enough to fight a different boss. When my team cut down the final one_ I couldn't think of many reasons compelling me to do it all over again. But later_ I watched a recording of the fight and saw that the final sliver of health on a boss we'd attempted at least six times was extinguished by the tiny magical daggers summoned by my sword's passive effect. And that's when the gears started turning. What if I found that weapon again and actually played the right character with the right items to emphasize that technique? What other effects have I ignored that could inspire entirely new strategies? I immediately wanted to go for another run as an experiment.  A rare_ precious item allowing you to revive once after death. Good luck getting one. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. Uh oh. It's possible Nightreign rules_ actually. The combinations of weapons and effects you can put together in a run frequently activate my "RPG build" neurons. Part of the reason we even made it to the point where the final boss was nine magic glintblades away from death is that I discovered the "successive attacks negate damage" passive effect. On most of Nightreign's eight playable characters it's hard to activate_ but it naturally synergizes with the dual-wielding knife specialist Duchess' playstyle. Though she's normally one of the squishiest nightfarers_ a flurry of stabs into a boss and I could tank an attack that would take my teammates out in one hit. Paired with a Relic that automatically activates her skill to repeat damage done to a boss after landing several hits in a row and I was playing an immortal god. The problem is you won't find those buffs every run—or on the right character. But when you do_ the thrill of having that kind of power in a FromSoft game is delicious_ especially when the difficulty is as brutal as Nightreign's. The RNG of it all and the number of bosses standing between you and the end demands a high level of execution and_ frankly_ luck. You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. In Fortnite_ the odds are stacked against you. One hundred players enter a match and only one comes out a winner. In Nightreign the odds are the same_ except most of the time the game wins. This feels backwards to how I've always approached FromSoft games_ but the elation of finally getting a win can be tantalizing. And that's all it takes to pull me back in. It doesn't matter whether it's a silly weapon I want to try again or a different character I want to learn_ like the witch who can yank magic out of enemies to buff her allies. Every time I get a taste of victory_ I forget the misery of spending 30 minutes to lose to a boss and hit the button to do it again anyway. Brutal but brilliant  Lucking into a great weapon drop can make all the struggle feel worth it. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played All of Nightreign's faults fade when the brutal difficulty and the randomized nature of it creates something beautiful_ like when you discover the skeletons summoned by the little necromancer girl can revive you when you're downed. Or when you're fighting a jellyfish god from another planet and your buddy in Skyrim armor screams as he rises into the sky on a giant rock_ saving you from a big attack. Or when you're low on healing flasks and praying for an easy boss and out from the dark portal steps a nightmare from an entirely different game_ one you thought you'd never have to face again. Sometimes Nightreign is so cruel all you can do is laugh as it shoves your nose in the dirt. But then it turns around and delivers catharsis. Everyone cheered in voice chat when Centipede Demon_ the boss nobody remembers from Dark Souls_ showed up to get obliterated by 14 years of action RPG combat advancement. When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played. I just wish it wasn't so hard to play—not because the bosses are tough_ but because of how indifferent it is to helping you experience everything that's so endearing about it. All the work is on you to find something that draws you back in_ to find a reason to try again. For me that's a new build or a new character to focus on with a game-changing Relic setup. For others it can be helping out a friend struggling with the brutal difficulty. And for something as experimental and as weird as Nightreign is_ that might be enough. Nightreign is light on story_ but it carries with it my favorite theme core to all of FromSoft's games: The irresistible nature to persevere against what feels like impossible odds. That I can spend three hours getting pummeled by a game as impenetrable as this and still feel the urge to give it another go has me annoyed that the same trick's working on me again. Nightreign may be kind of a mess_ but it's a mess made just for me.

325600490,Kyle Chrisley is happy his parents are coming home from prison.    On Tuesday_ May 27_ shortly after his younger sister Savannah Chrisley_ 27_ announced that dad Todd Chrisley and step-mom Julie Chrisley received a pardon from President Donald Trump_ the 33-year-old shared his reaction.    "I'm ecstatic_" Kyle told E! News. "Truly. I just found out a little bit ago and I still just can't believe it."   His biological mother is Todd’s ex-wife_ Teresa Terry.   "I know Savannah had been working at this for so long and she never gave up_" he continued. "So I'm just grateful to her and to President Trump for making this happen for my dad and Julie."   Todd_ 56_ and Julie_ 52_ were indicted in August 2019 and later sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison after being convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The couple had been appealing their case ever since.   Kyle_ who only appeared on the first season of Chrisley Knows Best as he became estranged from his father_ told E! News he is hopeful for the future.   "I know they can't wait to get home and just be with family_ and I'm going to remain hopeful that another reconciliation is possible_" Kyle told the outlet.   During a July 2024 episode of her Unlocked podcast_ Savannah explained why their father chose not to speak with Kyle.   “My dad has every reason not to speak to Kyle_” she said. “Just because it’s your child doesn’t mean that you have to accept abuse. It doesn't mean you have to accept manipulation and hate and all these things.”   After saying she and her father had the “strongest relationship_” she spoke out against her sibling.   “People will do anything for a little bit of fame or attention_” Savannah claimed_ saying Kyle provides statements about their father on social media and to the press. “What I don't process well is having Kyle play the victim to life circumstances he's created. What I don't do well with someone who has abused people his entire life now trying to play victim_ trying to get people to feel bad for him.”   She continued_ “Yes_ my father has not spoken to him and that is because now_ we are all at a place where we don't have to be abused any further. We are allowed to create boundaries for ourselves.”   On Tuesday_ Savannah said Trump called her personally to let her know he would be pardoning her parents.    Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Thank you Mr President for bringing my family back_" he wrote on his Instagram Story over a photo of Trump sitting in the Oval Office.

325813908,Hamas’s chief in Gaza_ Mohammed Sinwar_ has been killed_ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on May 28.  Speaking before the Knesset_ Israel’s Parliament_ Netanyahu said that the Jewish state has “eliminated Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif_ Yahya Sinwar_ and Mohammed Sinwar.”  Haniyeh was Hamas’s political leader when he was taken out by Israel in Tehran in July 2024. Deif was the head of Hamas’s military wing when he was killed by Israel in Gaza that same month. Yahya Sinwar_ who was the leader of Hamas_ was the mastermind behind Hamas’s Oct. 7_ 2023_ terrorist attack on Israel. He was killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza in October 2024. He was succeeded by his brother_ Mohammed.  Mohammed Sinwar_ 49_ was taken out by an Israeli strike in the Gaza city of Khan Younis_ where he once commanded the town’s brigade.  “In the last two days_ we’ve been executing a dramatic plan toward the complete defeat of Hamas_” Netanyahu said. “We’re taking control of their food distribution and money machine. This is what destroys their governing capabilities. That’s what we promised.”  Mohammed Sinwar’s history of terrorism includes being involved in the Hamas group that captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006_ who was held for five years before being released as part of an exchange that resulted in the release of more than 1_000 Palestinian terrorist prisoners. In the previous decade_ he spent nine months behind bars in Ramallah before escaping in 2000.

325587004,Elon Musk says he is "disappointed" by the price tag on the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House last week and heavily backed by President Trump_ the billionaire who recently stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE_ told "CBS Sunday Morning" in an exclusive broadcast interview."I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk said.Musk's comments appear to put him at odds with Mr. Trump_ who has championed the massive spending package. The legislation — which still needs to pass the Senate — would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts_ boost border security spending_ impose work requirements on Medicaid and roll back clean energy tax credits.The tax provisions of the package_ titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" after Mr. Trump's name for the bill_ would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034_ according to the Congressional Budget Office."I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_" Musk told CBS News_ "but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion."Musk was a near-constant presence in the early months of the Trump administration_ with his DOGE staffers sweeping through virtually every government agency to make widespread cuts — drawing concern from Democrats and even some Trump allies_ as well as numerous legal challenges. Musk_ who is also the CEO of Tesla_ SpaceX and the social media platform X_ has said he will dial back his involvement in government.See more of the interview with Elon Musk on "CBS Sunday Morning" on June 1.

325577048,It’s clear that Terry Bradshaw isn’t about to suggest Aaron Rodgers should wear the number 12 jersey for the Steelers. It’s even more obvious that Rodgers wouldn’t agree to it.  Bradshaw was blunt_ as he often is_ regarding the Steelers’ decision to wait indefinitely on Rodgers.  “That’s ridiculous_” Bradshaw remarked on 103.7 The Buzz in Little Rock_ Arkansas (as reported by CBSSports.com). “I find that notion laughable. What_ bring him in for just a single season? Are you serious? . . . . He should remain in California. Head out there_ munch on some tree bark_ and have conversations with the spirits.”  Bradshaw believes the Steelers should have given 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett more of a chance.  “I was a fan of Kenny Pickett_” Bradshaw mentioned. “I appreciated his play at Pitt. I know him and understand his character. When Pittsburgh got him_ here’s what they failed to do: They didn’t offer him protection…they didn’t provide a solid offensive line. They were focused on running the ball without a line capable of proper defense_ and they also lacked weapons. He virtually had no notable wide receivers.”  “And then they throw a kid in there for two years and you’ve got an offense that doesn’t fit and doesn’t work_ and they can’t run because their offensive line’s not even good enough for a run blocking team. And therefore they say Pickett was a failure. He wasn’t a failure_ the Steelers were a failure.”  The Steelers are willing to give Rodgers as much time as he wants because they believe_ with Rodgers at quarterback_ they won’t fail in 2025.   It all depends on what counts as success. Making the playoffs? Winning a playoff game? Getting to the conference championship?  Rodgers simply needs a season strong enough to cause his 2024 experience with the Jets to be viewed as an aberration. The Steelers and their fans could be aiming a lot higher than that.
325708928,May 28 (UPI) -- The Czech Republic accused China on Wednesday of being responsible for a "malicious cyber campaign" that targeted an unclassified network of the foreign ministry.  Little information about the cyberattack was made public_ the Czech government said it began in 2022_ affected an institution designated as Czech critical infrastructure and that it was perpetrated by well-known China-backed hackers APT31.  "The Government of the Czech Republic strongly condemns this malicious cyber campaign against its critical infrastructure_" the Czech foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.  "Such behavior undermines the credibility of the People's Republic of China and contradicts its public declarations."  APT31_ which stands for Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31_ is a collection of China state-sponsored intelligence officers_ contract hackers and support staff that conduct cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government.  Seven Chinese nationals were charged in the United States in late March for their involvement in APT31_ which federal prosecutors said has targeted U.S. and foreign critics of the Chinese government_ business_ and political officials over the last 14 years.  The Czech government said Wednesday it tied APT31 to the cyberattack through an "extensive investigation_" which "led to a high degree of certainty about the responsible actor."  "The Government of the Czech Republic has identified the People's Republic of China as being responsible_" it said.  NATO and the European Union -- both of which Czech is a member of -- were quick to condemn China following Prague's revelation.  "We stand in solidarity with the Czech Republic following the malicious cyber campaign against its Ministry of Foreign Affairs_" the security alliance said in a statement.  NATO did not blame China but acknowledged the Czechs' accusation of Beijing for the attack and said that it has observed "with increasing concern the growing pattern of malicious cyber activities stemming from the People's Republic of China."  Similarly_ the EU did not directly point the finger at China for the attack on the Czech Republic_ but said there have been cyberattacks linked to Beijing targeting EU and its member stats.  "In 2021_ we urged Chinese authorities to take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from their territories. Since then_ several Member States have attributed similar activities at their national level_" the EU's high representative_ Kaja Kallas_ said in a statement.  "We have repeatedly raised our concerns during bilateral engagements and we will continue to do so in the future."

325964330,While FromSoftware released a fairly impressive-looking launch trailer for Elden Ring Nightreign_ it has another that may resonate with fans on a deeper level. It showcases more gameplay with the Revenant_ the eighth and final Nightfarer to be revealed_ set to the tune of “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence. Yes_ seriously. Check it out below.  One of the Revenant’s abilities involves raising her downed allies_ which could very well be her Ultimate Art (and is the entire reason for the song).

325944054,Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday evening that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students_ including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields.”  He added that the State Department was revising visa criteria to “enhance scrutiny” of all future applications from China_ including Hong Kong.  The move is certain to send ripples of anxiety across university campuses in the United States and spur recriminations in China. China is the country of origin for the second-largest group of international students in the United States_ and many universities rely on Chinese and other international students paying full tuition for a substantial part of their annual revenue.  American universities have also benefited over many decades by drawing some of the most talented students from China and other countries. Chinese students and researchers are represented in large numbers in university science laboratories.
326084092,The dollar_ which has been under pressure since Mr. Trump started a trade war with U.S. trading partners_ rose on Wednesday. Oil prices_ which have dipped on fears that a slowdown in trade would hamper economic growth_ also jumped. The price of gold_ which has set a series of record highs as investors flocked to the traditional haven in times of turmoil_ slipped.  Investors sold U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 30-year Treasury note_ a focus for investors after Mr. Trump’s bill to cut taxes deepened worries about debt and deficits_ rose back above 5 percent. A significant reduction or cancellation of a chunk of U.S. tariffs “would be bad news for Treasuries since it would reduce a significant source of income and widen the budget deficit over the coming decade_” analysts at Panmure Liberum wrote in a note.  They added that the court ruling suggests that in the long run_ “extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely to happen going forward_ which reduces uncertainty somewhat.” But in the short term_ they said_ the ruling and subsequent challenges to it “will add significant uncertainty to the mix_ making it even harder for U.S. businesses to plan.”  That suggests markets could continue to veer up and down on tariff developments_ as investors now parse court rulings and appeals in addition to Mr. Trump’s threats_ delays and concessions.

325955376,May 28 (UPI) -- Elon Musk_ who personally spent $277 million to bring Donald Trump back to the White House_ said Wednesday night he is leaving the Trump administration after working to slash the size of the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency.  Musk_ the world's richest man with a net worth of $421.2 billion_ according to Forbes_ can work for 130 days in a calendar year as a special employee. His full-time tenure would end on Friday after joining Trump in the White House for the Jan. 20 inauguration.  Musk posted to X_ the social media platform he owns: "As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end_ I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government."  Musk told reporters earlier this week that he plans to focus more on his businesses: Tesla_ SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI_ which now includes X.  Musk said he will keep a small office in the White House as an unofficial adviser.  During a Tesla earnings call in April_ Musk said he would spend a "day or two per week" on government work until the end of Trump's term in January 2029.  There are around 100 DOGE employees_ including many embedded in agencies. Their status wasn't announced.  Musk told reporters last week that he had worked in Washington_ D.C._ on his DOGE initiative "seven days a week_ or close to seven days a week" during Trump's first 100 days in office. He frequently traveled on Air Force One with Trump to the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach_ Fla._ and recently to the Middle East.  This has meant less attention to his companies_ including publicly held Tesla_ the company that makes electric vehicles_ solar panels/shingles and energy storage devices.  "It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side_ and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks_" he said in an interview with Ars Technica.  Tesla released its first-quarter financial data on April 22.  Tesla's revenue was its lowest in three years: $19.3 billion total_ down 9% compared with the same time last year. The company's profit was $3.15 billion_ which is a 15% decline. And its earnings of 27 cents a share was a drop of 70% from 45 cents a year ago.  In the first quarter_ Tesla produced more than 362_000 vehicles.  On Wednesday_ pension fund leaders sent a letter to Tesla's board demanding that Musk must put in 40 hours per week_ at a minimum_ to attain any future CEO pay package.  Protests were mounted at dealerships nationwide as people opposed Musk's program and worker cuts.  He said his efforts have been far more challenging than expected and DOGE had become "the whipping boy for everything."  During an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday_ Musk said "something bad would happen anywhere_ and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it. People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That's really uncool."  Musk originally said he would slash $2 trillion in spending but now he says $175 billion in taxpayer money has been saved but experts say that number is greatly inflated.  He also became at odds with Trump on Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package going through Congress.  "I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk told CBS Sunday Morning. "I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_ but I don't know if it can be both."  He spoke to reporters from SpaceX headquarters in Texas before Tuesday night's Starship test flight.  "People want to have the chill vibes_ and SpaceX is sort of ultra hardcore. But if we're not ultra hardcore_ how are we going to get to Mars? You're not going to get to Mars in 40 hours a week_" Musk told The Post.  Besides sending astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station_ SpaceX has launched 8_774 Starlink satellites from Florida and California since May 2019.  Starlink is used by several federal agencies_ including the State Department_ Coast Guard_ Interior Department and the Space Force. The Federal Aviation Administration is exploring whether to use Starlink to replace its aging telecommunications system.
325964290,By AARON BEARD AP Sports Writer  RALEIGH_ N.C. — Carter Verhaeghe broke a tie off a feed from Aleksander Barkov with 7:39 left and the defending champion Florida Panthers advanced to their third straight Stanley Cup Final_ beating the Carolina Hurricanes_ 5-3_ on Wednesday night in Game 5.  The Panthers beat the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference final for the second time in three seasons. The Panthers will face the winner of the Western final between Edmonton and Dallas_ with the Oilers leading 3-1 in that best-of-seven series to put them within a win of a rematch with Florida for the Cup.  Sam Bennett added an empty-net goal with 54 seconds left by skating down a loose puck straight out of the penalty box after Florida had held up against a critical late power play for the Hurricanes.  That capped a wild night that saw the Hurricanes jump to a 2-0 lead_ then Florida answer with three second-period goals_ only to see Carolina’s Seth Jarvis beat Sergei Bobrovsky midway through the third to tie it at 3.  When it was over_ the Panthers posed for pictures on Carolina’s home ice during the presentation of the Prince of Wales Trophy for the conference winner. Some Hurricanes fans remained defiant_ offering scattered “Let’s go_ Oilers!” chants.  The angst is appropriate considering how Florida has now twice ended Carolina’s push to its first Cup Final since winning the franchise’s lone title in 2006 when now-coach Rod Brind’Amour was captain.  Florida had won the first three games of this series but lost 3-0 at home Monday night as the Hurricanes averted a second straight sweep against Florida. But by the final horn Wednesday_ the Panthers had won all three games in Raleigh in the series_ pushed their road winning streak in these playoffs to five games and earned an eighth postseason road win overall.  Matthew Tkachuk_ Evan Rodrigues and Anton Lundell scored on consecutive shots during Florida’s second-period flurry_ while Bobrovsky finished with 20 saves.  Barkov’s assist on Verhaeghe’s winner also stood out as its own terrific individual effort. Florida’s captain was jostling with Carolina’s Dmitry Orlov in a battle near the boards on the left side when he turned toward the crease_ stepped inside of Eric Robinson and sent the puck over to Verhaeghe for the finish that silenced a Hurricanes home crowd in full-throated roar after Jarvis’ tying score.  Sebastian Aho scored twice in the first period for Carolina_ both on neutral-zone giveaways – the first being one from Gustav Forsling that hit Aho in stride for a a breakaway chance that ended up in the net. Aho added another off a giveaway from Niko Mikkola with little more than a minute left in the first for a 2-0 lead.  Carolina has won at least one postseason series in its current run of seven straight playoff appearances_ though three have now ended in the Eastern final.  More to come on this story.
325949166,Sean Duffy first made a name for himself in 1997 as a housemate on The Real World: Boston.  He shares nine children with The Real World: San Francisco alum Rachel Campos-Duffy_ whom he met competing on Road Rules: All Stars in 1998 and married the following year.  Duffy spent eight years as Ashland County District Attorney in his home state of Wisconsin before serving in Congress from 2011 to 2019. He resigned from office that August_ citing his yet-to-be-born ninth child's health issues.  "After she’s born_ whether it’s two to six months after life_ she’s going to need open-heart surgery_" he explained on Fox & Friends. "They gotta crack her open and fix the heart."  Duffy added_ "I love politics_ but I love my family_ and I think it’s always a balance. The schedules are grueling. I’m out in D.C. four days a week_ and then I’m back with Rachel." Traveling around his district meeting people_ he said_ "we get beat up a little bit as members of Congress. We’re a favorite punching bag."  On The Real World_ "I was forced to live with people who were so different than me_" he told NCTA in May 2019. "When I first got there_ I saw the stark differences I had with my roommates. But when I left_ I realized I had way more in common with them than I ever imagined."  He compared the experience to crossing the aisle in Congress: "It's amazing the kind of legislation you can work on together and how many points of agreement you actually have."
325938970,President Trump on Wednesday commuted the sentence of notorious former Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover_ who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover_ 74_ the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples_ was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for the 1973 murder of 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer William "Pooky" Young_ when he was convicted of federal charges in 1997_ and sentenced to six life terms. Hoover was among 39 Gangster Disciples leaders indicted in August 1995 in Operation Headache_ a six-year effort by the feds to infiltrate Gangster Disciples. Federal prosecutors had accused him of leading a criminal enterprise to continue overseeing the gang while in prison in Illinois. Hoover is currently serving six life sentences in a maximum security prison in Colorado_ according to federal prison records. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody_ but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois_ dating back to 1973 for Young's murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at ADX Florence_ a maximum security prison in Colorado that they described as "the most restrictive_ draconian supermax prison in the United States."In a statement_ Hoover's attorneys_ Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore_ said they are "thrilled" to see he will be released from federal custody. "The Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover's considerable growth and complete rehabilitation. Despite the Court's unwillingness to do the right thing_ Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters. Thankfully_ Mr. Hoover's pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover."When Hoover was up for parole by the State of Illinois in 2022_ his parole was denied. An Illinois Department of Corrections order says Hoover would have to be turned over to the state to serve the remainder of his state sentence if released from federal custody. In 1993_ Hoover spoke to former CBS News Chicago reporter John Davis. At the time_ Hoover was 42 years old and had already served 20 years in prison."I've done my time_" Hoover said in the 1993 interview. "I paid my debt to society."In the interview with Davis_ the leader of the Gangster Disciples and convicted murderer he'd had a lot of time to think about ways to stop the gang violence on the streets of Chicago."One teenager don't like the other teenager because of the way he wear his hat_ because his ideology is different from his; a Disciple don't like a Vice Lord_" Hoover said in the interview. "We're all Black people. There's no difference."At that time_ Hoover_ also known as King Larry_ admitted being part of a fragile gang truce in the city and organizing a protest over plans to close healthcare clinics in African American neighborhoods. Ron Safer_ the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial_ expressed disappointment in the news of Hoover's sentence being commuted. "I was disappointed_" Safer said. "I do not think that this is an appropriate end to the Larry Hoover story â at least the federal part of it."Safer said Hoover was perhaps the most notorious criminal the state of Illinois has ever known. "He was convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise that had approximately 30_000 members across 28 states_ selling over $100 million worth of drugs in the state of Illinois alone each year_" said Safer_ "and he ran that entire operation with ruthless efficiency from prison_ where he was serving a state sentence for double murder."Safer also emphasized that about Hoover had been recorded saying teenagers needed to sell drugs for his criminal organization. The recording was made a year after the Gangster Disciples leader was interviewed on CBS Chicago."There was another tape where Larry Hoover said_ 'You have to share your drugs with these children â and I'm talking about 12 years old_ 13 years old_ 14 years old â so that they can sell it_ and they can have something'_" Safter said_ "and he said_ 'Make them know that with you_ they are somebody_ and without you_ they are nobody.'"Again_ Safer said those comments were made by Hoover after the Gangster Disciples said he was redeemed_ and said he understood that all of the violence in the city should be stopped.

327172888,The authorities said they were investigating an attack in Boulder_ Colo._ on Sunday as an act of terrorism_ after a man used a “makeshift flamethrower” to attack demonstrators honoring Israeli hostages in Gaza.  Six people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries_ and two of them were in serious condition_ officials said.  Witnesses said the man threw an incendiary device into the crowd in a downtown pedestrian mall_ according to the authorities. The suspect_ identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs_ yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack_ the witnesses said. Mr. Soliman_ 45_ had not been charged as of late Sunday night.  The attack may intensify deep unease in the Jewish community in the United States. In recent months_ two Israeli embassy aides were murdered in Washington_ and a man set fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania_ who is Jewish.
327326166,By LINDSAY WHITEHURST_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — A split Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a challenge to a state ban on assault weapons_ semiautomatic rifles that are popular among gun owners and that have also been used in multiple mass shootings.  The majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the case_ as is typical. But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement_ and a fourth said he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional.  Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken the case_ and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.  “I would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America_” Thomas wrote. “That question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR–15 owners throughout the country.”  Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now_ but he said that he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue “in the next term or two.”  The Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15_ one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.  Several states have similar measures_ and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15.  The case comes three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country.  Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws_ covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004.

327393126,The man accused of injuring eight people Sunday on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall with a “makeshift flamethrower” and Molotov cocktails researched and planned the attack for more than a year_ according to federal court documents.  Mohamed Sabry Soliman_ a 45-year-old man whom federal officials said was living in Colorado illegally at the time of the attack_ has been charged with a federal hate crime_ according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest affidavit.  Soliman threw two lit Molotov cocktails at the crowd of Run for Their Lives demonstrators_ burning eight people_ the affidavit stated. Investigators found another box with at least 14 unlit Molotov cocktails inside nearby.  Run for Their Lives is a national movement calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The local Boulder chapter was hosting their weekly walk on Pearl Street when they were attacked by Soliman outside of the courthouse.  The walk was scheduled for 1 p.m. Soliman told federal officials he arrived at 12:55 p.m. and waited for them to arrive.  “No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin_ and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice_” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”  The Molotov cocktails were made with bottles and jars_ contained clear liquid and had red rags hanging out_ according to the document. A backpack weed sprayer was also discovered near the box of explosives.  Federal officials said the jars and weed sprayer were all filled with gasoline.  Soliman told investigators that he planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives chapter_ which he called a “Zionist group_” federal officials said.  Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again_ according to the FBI arrest affidavit.

327230032,Nationalist Karol Nawrocki_ backed by U.S. President Donald Trump_ clinched the Polish presidency in a tight run-off race that spells trouble for the country's current pro-EU government.  A final count showed Nawrocki_ who stood for the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost its majority in 2023_ secured 50.89% of votes against the 49.11% of rival Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Early results released before polls closed had put the liberal in the lead.  Nawrocki will succeed fellow conservative Andrzej Duda — who himself won the leadership with a razor-thin advantage against Trzaskowski in 2020 — for a five-year term and can then stand for re-election once.   The Polish election was closely watched in Europe_ the United States and battling Eastern European neighbors Russia and Ukraine as it raises questions over the solidity of Warsaw's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv.  The head of state's role in Poland is overshadowed by that of parliament_ but the president retains a critical veto over legislation. Duda has exercised this to block several reforms spearheaded by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition.  Eurosceptic Nawrocki can likewise deliver considerable setbacks to former European Council President Tusk's pro-EU government_ which repaired fractured relations with Brussels and last year unlocked payments of up to 137 billion euros ($156 billion) of EU funds that had been frozen over rule-of-law concerns.  The country of 37 million and the EU's sixth-largest economy was the largest net beneficiary of EU funds in 2024.  "I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland. We are all stronger together in our community of peace_ democracy_ and values_" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Monday on the X social media platform. "So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home."   A previously staunch supporter of Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion to date_ Poland has offered extensive security and logistical aid to Kyiv and earlier in January assumed the rotating one-year EU presidency from the Kremlin's chief European ally Hungary under the motto "Security_ Europe!"  Nawrocki has taken a more critical stance toward Kyiv during his campaign_ citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's alleged poor treatment of Poland. He also ruled out the embattled country's long-held ambition of adhering to NATO — a move feared to pit the military coalition against Russian hostilities.
327235828,Chinese authorities on Monday accused the U.S. of violating a recent trade pact that both agreed to in Geneva last month_ as they dismissed President Donald Trump’s allegation about Beijing breaching the agreement_ a move that could signal a further escalation in trade tensions between the two countries_ which could potentially jeopardize last month’s tariff truce.  China's Commerce Ministry accused the U.S. of violating a trade deal agreed in Geneva by imposing ... More additional chip restrictions and canceling Chinese student visas. AFP via Getty Images  In a press briefing_ a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson dismissed Trump’s comments accusing China of violating the agreement_ saying Beijing has worked “to strictly implement and actively safeguard the Geneva deal.”  The spokesperson noted that China had acted in accordance with the deal to cancel or suspend “relevant tariffs and non-tariff measures” it had taken as retaliation against the U.S. government’s reciprocal tariffs.  The spokesperson then accused the U.S. of introducing “ a number of discriminatory restrictive measures against China” after the talks_ citing expanded export controls on AI chips and other chip-building technology.  The official also criticized the U.S. government’s crackdown on Chinese student visas_ saying these actions violated the consensus reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on January 17.  The spokesperson then warned that if the U.S. continues to take actions that damage China_ Beijing will “take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”  What Had Trump Said About China Violating The Geneva Deal?  In a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday_ Trump said: “China_ perhaps not surprisingly to some_ HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US_” without specifying how it had done so. The president then signalled that the U.S. may retaliate against this alleged non-compliance_ saying: “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” In his post_ the president claimed his tariffs had put China in “grave economic danger” and he made a “FAST DEAL” in Geneva_ “in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation.”  What Do We Know About The Current State Of U.s.-China Trade Talks?  In an interview with Fox News last week_ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that trade talks with China were “a bit stalled_” but said he believes U.S. officials will be “having more talks with them in the next few weeks.” Bessent did not specify any sticking points that have prevented the talks from progressing_ but noted that he believes a direct call between Trump and Xi will be needed to close the deal. “I think that given the magnitude of the talks_ given the complexity_ that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other_” the treasury secretary said. Bessent then added that Trump and Xi have a “very good relationship” and he was “confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known.”  Key Background  U.S. and Chinese officials met in Geneva last month to discuss a resolution to a spiraling trade war between the two countries_ triggered by President Donald Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs.” After the meeting both sides announced they had agreed to significantly cut back tariffs placed on each other’s goods for at least 90 days_ while continuing discussions on a broader trade deal. As part of the agreement_ both sides agreed to lower their “reciprocal tariffs” on each other from 125% to 10%. However_ a separate 20% tariff on Chinese goods imposed by Trump earlier this year—over China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis in the U.S.—would remain in effect_ keeping the overall tariffs on Chinese goods at 30%. The talks came after both sides engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war which saw U.S. levies on China hit 145% while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were raised to 125%. While announcing the deal_ Bessent acknowledged that the spiraling tariffs were equivalent to a trade embargo and said “neither side wants that.”  What To Watch For  No meetings have taken place between the two sides since the Geneva talks. In their joint statement_ both sides had agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations.” Bessent and Greer will represent the U.S. side in these discussions_ while Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side. These future talks were set to be held alternately in China and the U.S. or in a third country that both sides agree upon. It is unclear how these proposed meetings will be handled amid the latest round of tensions. After the Geneva deal announcement_ Trump also said he was looking forward to talk with Xi_ but that also hasn’t happened so far.

327173224,WARSAW_ Poland — Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election_ according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski_ who received 49.11%.  The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday_ revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.  An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later.  The outcome indicates that Poland can be expected to take a more nationalist path under its new leader_ who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.  The role of a president in Poland  Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However_ the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and to veto legislation.  Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda_ a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.  A headache for Tusk  Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 at the end of a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide — so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises_ such as loosening the restrictive abortion law.  But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.  Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises_ which he had made both to voters and to the EU.  A former boxer_ historian and political novice  Nawrocki_ a 42-year-old historian_ was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.  The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023_ when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback_ and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.  Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance_ which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland_ and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list_ according to Polish media reports.  Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional_ patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends_ including LGBTQ+ visibility_ have embraced him_ viewing him as a reflection of the traditional values they grew up with.  The Trump factor  Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.  The conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland last week to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem_ the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally_ strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.  The U.S. has about 10_000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.  A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore "normality_" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies_ and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.
327140658,Two Oregon high school athletes refused to share the podium with a transgender competitor at the state’s track and field championships_ footage shows.  The female students — Tigard High School’s Alexa Anderson and Sherwood High School’s Reese Eckard — stepped down from the high jump podium as the winners of the competition were being announced across the Eugene stadium Saturday night.  Anderson and Eckard had finished in third and fourth place_ while Ida B. Wells High School’s trans student Lia Rose tied for fifth.  Rose had competed in boys’ track and field divisions as recently as 2024 and 2023_ according to Fox News.  Crowds were cheering for the athletes throughout the ceremony_ and it remains unclear how the audience reacted to the protest.  A race official showed up shortly after Anderson and Eckard stepped down and ushered them away as they stood with their backs to the podium.  It remains unclear if their standing at the competition was affected by the move.  But the incident quickly gained attention online_ especially after women’s sports advocate Riley Gaines — who is staunchly opposed to transgender athletes competing in women’s sports — posted footage from it on X.  “Watch this. Two female athletes in Oregon refused to stand on the podium because a boy was awarded a place_” Gaines wrote.   “Girls have had enough_” she added.  The video was also picked up by other accounts — including “Libs of TikTok” — which praised the athletes’ act of defiance.  It was just the latest incident where women’s athletes have protested against transgender competitors in their division.   In April_ women’s fencer Stephanie Turner took a knee rather than competing with a trans person during a Maryland match_ and was put on a year-long probation by USA Fencing for the move.  And in May_ 16-year-old high schooler Reese Hogan finished second to a trans athlete in California’s CIF Southern Section Finals triple jump competition — but stepped up to the first place spot on the podium after her competitor stepped down.
327320366,By SAM McNEIL_ Associated Press  BARCELONA_ Spain (AP) — The European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration’s surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.  EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal_ but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side_” European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.  “In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome_ the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures_ including in response to this latest tariff increase_” Gill said.  He said the EU is finalizing an “expanded list of countermeasures” that would “automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier.” That’s the date when a 90-day pause_ intended to ease negotiations_ ends in tariffs announced by the two economic powerhouses on each other. About halfway through that grace period_ Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.  Trump’s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs_ with levies threatened_ added and_ often_ taken away. Top officials at the EU’s executive commission says they’re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods. Negotiations will next continue on Wednesday in Paris in a meeting between the EU’s top trade negotiator_ Maroš Šefčovič_ and his counterpart_ U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.  The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S._ as well as lower duties on cars_ but it isn’t likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — or open up the EU to American beef.  The EU has offered the U.S. a “zero for zero” outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides for industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that but EU officials have said it’s still on the table.  The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are also so ubiquitous in packaging that they’re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.
327343944,Washington â The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term_ which begins in October_ with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time_ place and manner of federal elections.If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue_ their lawsuit could proceed. The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted. Bost_ who was first elected to Congress in 2014_ and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes_ infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments_ and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023_ finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue_ a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year_ agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court_ arguing that in recent years_ the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts."The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations_" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court_ adding that it is "vitally important" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court."It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time_ place_ and manner regulations affecting their elections_" the Republicans wrote. "Aside from the interests of the litigants_ it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly_ not arbitrary_ fashion."But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal_ arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day_ but arrive after."They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future_" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. "Rather_ petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates_ on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time_ place_ and manner of conducting an election."

327858142,Jessie J is providing an update on her health.  The "Bang Bang" singer shared that she was diagnosed with breast cancer over two months ago and has been "in and out of tests" this year.   "I was diagnosed with early breast cancer_" Jessie said in an Instagram video June 3. "Cancer sucks in any form_ but I'm holding on to the word 'early.'"  The 37-year-old said she will undergo surgery after performing at the Summertime Ball 2025 concert in London on June 15.   "It's a very dramatic way to get a boob job_" she explained. "I am going to disappear for a bit after Summertime Ball to have my surgery_ and I will come back with massive tits and more music."  While Jessie—who shares son Sky_ 2_ with basketball player Chanan Safir Colman—noted that she hesitated to announce her diagnosis publicly_ she decided to be "open" for multiple reasons.  "One_ because_ selfishly_ I do not talk about it enough_" she continued. "I'm not processing it because I'm working so hard. I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I'm an open book."

328071010,NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI has made an arrest in New York in connection with an explosion of a Palm Springs_ California fertility clinic_ three law enforcement officials familiar with the matter said Wednesday.  Federal prosecutors are expected to release details about the case at a news conference in Los Angeles.  The arrest_ which was first reported by NBC News_ took place at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Tuesday evening_ according to the officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a criminal case that has not been publicly disclosed.  The arrest stems from an apparent car bomb detonation of a fertility clinic last month by a man who authorities said had nihilistic writings. The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect and said he was believed to have died in the explosion. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.  Officials said at the time that they were investigating whether Bartkus had any help.  The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palms Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene_ with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street.  A senior FBI official called the explosion possibly the “largest bombing scene that we’ve had in Southern California.”  Bartku attempted to livestream the explosion and left behind writings that communicated “nihilistic ideations” that were still being examined to determine his state of mind_ the FBI said. U.S. Attorney Bilal “Bill” Essayli_ the top federal prosecutor in the area_ called the message “anti-pro-life.”
328005216,For the leaders of U.S. Jewish institutions_ the recent attacks in Boulder_ Colorado_ and Washington_ D.C._ are stark reminders of their responsibility to remain vigilant despite years of hardening their security measures and trying to keep their people safe.  Now_ they’re sounding the alarm for more help after a dozen people were injured in Boulder while demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza on Sunday. And just over a week earlier_ two Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot outside a Jewish museum in Washington.   After that shooting_ 43 Jewish organizations issued a joint statement requesting more support from the U.S. government for enhanced security measures. Specifically_ they asked Congress to increase funding to the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to $1 billion.  “Every Jewish organization has been serious about security for years. We have to be_” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs_ president of the Union for Reform Judaism. “The grants are to harden the buildings_ for things like cameras and glass_ and some kind of blockage so they can’t drive a truck into the building.”  “These are the everyday realities of Jewish life in the 21st century in America. It’s a sad reality_ but it is an essential responsibility of leadership to make sure that people are first and foremost safe.”  Shira Hutt_ executive vice president at The Jewish Federations of North America_ said existing federal funds were inadequate_ with only 43% of last year’s applicants to the grant program receiving funding.  Citing the attack in Boulder_ she said increased funding for local law enforcement is also crucial.  “Thankfully_ the attack was stopped before even further damage could have been done_” she said. “This is really now a full-blown crisis_ and we need to make sure that we have all the support necessary.”  One of the Jewish Federation’s state-based affiliates_ JEWISHcolorado_ on Tuesday launched an emergency fund to raise $160_000 in support of the Boulder community. Its goals include enhancing safety and security measures for Jewish institutions and events.  Strengthening alliances and pushing for results  Leaders of Jewish Federation Los Angeles urged government_ business and philanthropic groups to “supercharge an alliance so we can build mutual understanding_ dispel conspiracy theories_ and provide rapid response when any group is under threat.”  “Jews here in Los Angeles are terrified but determined_” said the federation’s president_ Rabbi Noah Farkas. “We do not need more community meetings_ we need results and we are counting on our local government and our law enforcement partners to do more.”  The security costs at 63 Jewish day schools have risen on average 84% since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct_ 7_ 2023_ according to the Teach Coalition_ the education advocacy arm of the Orthodox Union_ an umbrella group for Orthodox Judaism.  The coalition is advocating for more state and federal security funding for Jewish schools and camps_ as well as synagogues.   The attacks in Washington and Boulder only heighten the urgency_ said its national director Sydney Altfield.  “Some people see this as an isolated instance_ whether it is in Colorado_ whether it’s in D.C._” she said. “But we have to step up and realize that it could happen anywhere. … It is so important that our most vulnerable_ our children_ are secure to the highest extent.”  In Florida_ Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of Congregation Beth Am said members of the Reform synagogue in the Tampa Bay area “are feeling very nervous right now and having some additional security might make people a little bit more comfortable.”  He said that “there’s a definite sense that these attacks are not isolated events_ that these attacks are_ in part_ the result of a lot of the antisemitic rhetoric that we’ve been hearing in society for years now.”  However_ he said part of his message as a faith leader in such a climate has been to encourage resilience.  “We can’t let this define us. … We can’t stop doing what we do; we can’t stop coming to synagogue; we can’t stop having our activities_” he said. “Our job is to add holiness to our lives and to the world_ and we can’t let this stop us from focusing on sacred work.”  Security concerns inside and outside  Jacobs_ the Reform Judaism leader_ said the latest attacks in Washington and Boulder signaled that new security strategies were needed.  “Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were murdered outside of the event at the D.C. Jewish Museum_” he said.  “And that presented a whole additional sort of challenges for law enforcement and for each of our institutions doing security_ which is: you can’t just worry about who comes in; you actually have to worry about who’s lurking outside_ and so_ that is part now of our protocols.”  The attack in Boulder_ he said_ took place during a “peaceful protest” where demonstrators were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.  “We have to worry about what happens inside our institutions. … We also have to be thinking and working with law enforcement about what happens outside.”  Jacobs recalled that when a Christian leader recently visited a Reform synagogue_ he was “stunned by the security protocols_” which included procedures that Jacobs likened to passengers passing through airport security.  “I said_ ‘Well_ what do you do in your churches?’ and he said_ ‘Well_ we like to be welcoming.’ And I said: ‘We don’t have that luxury. We want to make sure our people feel safe_ otherwise people will stop coming.’”  Associated Press reporter Tiffany Stanley contributed to this report.

327840856,By Juan A. Lozano | Associated Press  HOUSTON — What prompted the fatal shooting of Jonathan Joss_ a Native American voice actor best known for his work on the animated television series “King of the Hill_” remained unclear Tuesday.  While Joss’ husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled “violent homophobic slurs” before opening fire_ San Antonio police have said they’ve found “no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss’ murder was related to his sexual orientation.” Police did not respond to multiple emails on Tuesday seeking additional information on the cause of the shooting.  Since Joss’ killing_ friends_ actors Joss worked with and fans have honored the actor’s memory with tributes and fond remembrances.  Here’s what to know about Joss_ his career and his shooting:  Who was Joss?  Joss_ 59_ grew up in San Antonio and graduated from the communications and theater program at Our Lady of the Lake University in 1990.  Joss was best known as the voice of John Redcorn_ a Native American character on the popular “King of the Hill” animated series_ which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show_ which Joss had already worked on_ is set to start in August.  Joss also had a recurring role on the television show “Parks and Recreation_” playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series “Tulsa King” in 2022.  What was happening with Joss in the months before his death?  Joss’ childhood home_ where he still lived_ burned down in January. He lost all his belongings and his three dogs were killed in the blaze. A GoFundMe account had been set up to help Joss and his husband_ Tristan Kern de Gonzales_ get back on their feet.  “We may have lost our home_ but not our hope. We’re moving forward with love_ humor_ and a little elbow grease…and we’re incredibly grateful for every ounce of support_” Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.  By the end of May_ Joss was back in Texas_ and on Saturday_ he took part in a live music performance in Austin_ located about 80 miles northeast of San Antonio.  Who is accused of fatally shooting Joss?  Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez_ 56_ is accused by police of confronting Joss and his husband as they were checking their mail at the burned-down home Sunday night.  In a statement_ de Gonzales alleged that when Ceja Alvarez opened fire_ Joss pushed his husband out of the way and saved his life.  Ceja Alvarez was charged with murder. Court records indicate he was freed Monday on a $200_000 bond.  Ceja Alvarez’s attorney_ Alfonso Otero_ did not immediately return a call or an email seeking comment.  Robert Rios_ a friend of Joss’_ told TV station KSAT that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.  How is Joss being remembered by friends_ actors?  Actor Chris Pratt_ who worked with Joss on “Parks and Recreation_” fondly remembered the actor in an Instagram story on Monday. Both actors had also appeared in the 2016 remake of “The Magnificent Seven.”  “Damn. RIP Jonathan. Always such a kind dude_” Pratt wrote. “Sad to see. Prayers up. Hug your loved ones.”  In a Facebook post_ San Antonio-based Our Lady of the Lake University_ Joss’ alma mater_ called him “a trailblazer in his field. His work and advocacy have left a lasting impact_ and his legacy will continue to inspire.”  “You were more than a character — you were a storyteller_ a dreamer_ and a force that will never be forgotten_” comedian Roy Alex Gomez_ who was a friend of Joss_ wrote in a Facebook post.
328023062,Iran’s supreme leader on Wednesday blasted the US as “arrogant” as he effectively rejected a revised nuclear deal that would allow Tehran to continue low-level uranium enrichment after it is signed.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei argued that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100%” against the country’s interests and “can do spirit” — as he ripped a central US demand amid talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.  “The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100% against our interests… The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear program. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?” he said in a televised speech.  Khamenei’s remarks come just days after the US presented Iran with the proposal for a new nuclear deal.  The proposal outline_ first reported Monday by Axios_ was submitted Saturday by White House special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.  If agreed_ it would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium domestically_ but only for civilian use.   Tehran will also have to temporarily reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% — well below weapons-grade levels of 90%.  After five rounds of talks_ several hard-to-bridge issues still remain — including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil.  Khamenei_ who has the final say on all matters of state_ stopped short of saying the talks should be halted.  He did_ however_ say that the latest proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’.”  “Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear program and the enemies have focused on the enrichment_” Khamenei said.

327837128,The supply chain warfare_ which comes on top of tariffs the two countries have inflicted on the other’s imports_ has alarmed companies that say they cannot make their products without components sourced from both. And it has made officials in Washington increasingly nervous about other choke points where China could squeeze the United States_ including pharmaceuticals or shipping.  In recent weeks_ the airplane industry has emerged as both a weapon_ and a victim_ in this fight.  The jet engine technology that powers airplanes_ and the navigation systems that control them_ largely come from the United States_ developed by companies like General Electric. In China’s quest to build a viable competitor to Boeing_ for example_ it has had to source engine technology from GE Aerospace.  But a jet engine also cannot be made without China. Minerals that are processed there are essential for special coatings and components that help the engine operate smoothly at high temperatures_ as well as other uses.  Beijing restricted exports of those minerals_ known as rare earths_ in April after President Trump began imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports.  The move has threatened to shutter what is left of advanced manufacturing in the United States — including the work done by many defense contractors. In May_ Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets it needed to build cars.  The United States responded with its own tech restrictions. Last week_ U.S. officials suspended some licenses that allowed American companies to ship airplane technology to China_ as well as others related to biotechnology and semiconductors_ people familiar with the move say.  At the same time_ officials in the Department of Defense_ the Department of the Interior and the National Security Council are accelerating efforts to find more domestic supplies of rare earths_ including considering U.S. government funding for new mines and processing facilities_ people familiar with the matter said.  But any such efforts could take years to come to fruition. On average_ it has taken the United States 29 years to develop a single mine_ according to statistics from S&P.  The Trump administration is also weighing further actions. It has been considering including major Chinese chipmakers_ as well as units of Chinese technology giants like Alibaba_ Tencent and Baidu_ on a so-called entity list that prohibits them from engaging in trade with the United States_ people familiar with the discussions said.  The supply chain battle has been years in the making. And both countries have been trying to guard against the other’s control of strategic goods by diversifying their own sources of supply.  After Mr. Trump levied tariffs on China during his first term_ many American companies established factories in countries outside of China_ including Vietnam and Mexico. Xi Jinping_ China’s leader_ set out to make his country less reliant on foreign sources of energy and technology by pumping huge investments into factories making semiconductors_ solar panels and electric vehicles.  Even so_ the economies remain deeply integrated_ an intractable reality as hundreds of billions of dollars in trade flow across the Pacific each year. While both countries are resolved to reduce their dependencies on the other for national security reasons_ doing so will be expensive and painful.  Since 2022_ for example_ the United States has been steadily expanding a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and stop the technology from flowing to China. The rules have been aimed at restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence and advanced computing needed to augment its military. But they have been met with fierce resistance from an industry that sees China as an important source of revenue.  The United States has extended these export controls around the world_ even forbidding companies in other countries from selling products to China if they use American parts_ technology or software to manufacture them. While some foreign governments have bristled at these rules_ many have fallen in line.  This system rests on the idea that the United States should be the sole global power whose rules other countries need to abide by. But for China_ rare earth minerals are a way to challenge the American assertion of dominance.  Beijing set up a licensing system that allows it to monitor and approve sales of rare earths_ and magnets made from them_ to companies worldwide. When Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on China to 145 percent in April_ Beijing responded by targeting shipments of rare earths_ including pausing many of them.  In May_ American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva to try to defuse their trade tensions. The Trump administration had several reasons to try to strike a truce. Companies had been warning of the risk of empty store shelves later this year because of plummeting imports from China_ and stock and bond markets were flashing warning signs. But it was China’s rare earth restrictions that appeared to put the most pressure on the United States to reach a resolution.  Negotiators agreed in Geneva to lower tariffs. As part of the deal_ China said it would “suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April_” according to a joint statement.  U.S. officials say Chinese shipments have yet to return to their previous levels. During an appearance on CNBC on Friday_ Jamieson Greer_ the United States Trade Representative_ said that the Chinese were “slow-rolling their compliance” and that American officials “haven’t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they’re supposed to be doing.”  Mr. Trump was more blunt. In a post on Truth Social on Friday_ he wrote that China had “TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US_” adding_ “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”  Lin Jian_ a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs_ denied the accusation in a briefing Tuesday_ saying that China had “earnestly implemented” the consensus reached in Geneva. Chinese officials say it is the United States that broke the deal_ including by issuing a notice saying that the use of chips made by Huawei_ the Chinese technology firm_ anywhere in the world violated U.S. law.  “The U.S._ without any factual basis_ has smeared and accused China_ imposed export controls on chips_ suspended sales of chip design software to China and announced the cancellation of Chinese student visas — extreme measures that severely undermine the Geneva Consensus and harm China’s legitimate rights and interests_” Mr. Lin said.  While some U.S. auto and electronics makers have recently received licenses from China for mineral shipments_ the uncertainty and continued backlog of requests for the products are continuing to make companies nervous. China had also appeared to be giving preference to European companies over American ones.  The tensions are spilling over into other aspects of the United States’ diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration has also proposed plans to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students_ including those with ties to the Communist Party.  So far_ it is unclear how the tensions can be defused. Karoline Leavitt_ the White House press secretary_ said Monday that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would likely speak in a call this week. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he had “no information to offer” on the call.  Daniel H. Rosen_ the co-founder of Rhodium Group_ a research company_ said that Beijing recognized years ago that rare earths would be central to advanced technologies and subsidized the build-out of those supplies. The United States_ he added_ “horribly underestimated” the demand for them.  China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths_ but it does the chemical processing for 90 percent of them. The country also makes more than 80 percent of the world’s batteries_ more than 70 percent of its electric cars_ and about half of the world’s steel_ iron and aluminum_ according to data from the International Energy Agency.  Securing an alternative supply would likely require the United States to invest hundreds of billions of dollars_ Mr. Rosen said_ and cooperation with global partners who were willing to work to set up supply chains outside of China.  “It’s going to be expensive_” he said. “We have a long way to go.”  While some shipments of minerals have restarted_ many U.S. industries remain anxious about shortages of supplies. Paul Triolo_ a partner at Albright Stonebridge Group_ said the Chinese licensing system was cumbersome and that there had been a notable drop in shipments of critical minerals since the start of April_ when Mr. Trump first issued astronomical tariffs on China.  Mr. Triolo said the United States had no choice except to negotiate with Beijing on the issue_ as well as set up a long-term strategy with other countries to reduce its dependence on China over the next five to seven years.  “This problem is deep and long lasting_” he said. “It will not go away_ or be easily solved.”  Chris Buckley_ Keith Bradsher and Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting and research.
277437292,Justin Baldoni filed a bombshell $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times after they published a story about his “It Ends With Us” co-star Blake Lively’s sexual harassment allegations.  According to Variety_ the actor filed the 87-page complaint in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday after the Times published the article “We Can Bury Anyone”: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine” on Dec. 21.   The filing lists his 10 plaintiffs_ including his publicists Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan_ who accused the outlet of “libel and false light invasion of privacy.”  “It Ends With Us” producers Steve Sarowitz and Jamey Heath allege the Times “cherry-picked and altered communications” without providing “necessary context.”  The lawsuit also accused the outlet of “promissory fraud and breach of implied-in-fact contract” with an argument against the claims written in their story about Lively_ per Variety.  “The Times story relied almost entirely on Lively’s unverified and self-serving narrative_ lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives_” the complaint alleges.   The lawsuit also points out that Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni on Dec. 21 rather than a lawsuit_ which the latter’s filing referred to as “a choice that spared her from the scrutiny of the discovery process_ including answering questions under oath and producing her communications.  “This decision was no accident_” the lawsuit states.   The “Gossip Girl” alum_ however_ also filed a lawsuit against Baldoni on Tuesday_ accusing him of emotional distress.  Reps for Lively and the New York Times weren’t immediately available to Page Six for comment.  Earlier this month_ Lively spoke to the Times after filing a complaint against Baldoni_ accusing him of sexual harassment.   “I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted_” she told the outlet.  The two worked together on the film adaption of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel about domestic violence from 2023 to early 2024.   Per the filing obtained by Page Six_ the “A Simple Favor” star claimed a meeting about Baldoni’s behavior on set as the movie’s antagonist and director.   In the meeting — which was also attended by Lively’s husband_ Ryan Reynolds — Baldoni was allegedly warned to stop talking about his porn addiction and showing the actress “nude videos or images of women.”  The movie producer was also allegedly told not to discuss the “cast and crew’s genitalia_” Lively’s weight or her late father. Baldoni was allegedly prohibited from adding more sex scenes to the film  According to the complaint_ Lively also accused her co-star of coordinating a smear campaign to ruin her reputation.  The “Jane the Virgin” star and Lively notably worked with intimacy coordinators on set to ensure they could “all feel safe.”  His and Wayfarer Studios’ lawyer_ Bryan Freedman_ also denied the allegations put forth by the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” star_ referring to them as “serious and categorically false.”  “These claims are completely false_ outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media_” he told us.  Freedman also claimed that his client was forced to hire a crisis manager because of Lively’s “multiple demands and threats_” which allegedly included threatening to not return to set or promote the film “if her demands were not met.”  When “It Ends With Us” was released in August_ sources told Page Six Baldoni allegedly made the mom of four feel “uncomfortable” on set.   Lively reportedly felt insecure about her figure and thought Baldoi_ who had previously experienced a back injury_ “fat-shamed” her when he asked how much she weighed so he could prepare to lift her for a scene.  Lively_ however_ came under fire when promoting the film and was criticized for her approach to questions about the movie’s theme of domestic violence.

At a news conference_ New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell described the killings as a “terrorist attack” and the city’s police chief said the act was clearly intentional.  Police Commissioner Anne Kirkpatrick said the driver was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”  “It was very intentional behavior. This man was trying to run over as many people as he could_” Kirkpatrick said.  FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan said officials were investigating the at least one suspected improvised explosive device at the scene.  The area is known as one of the largest New Year’s Eve destinations.  Crowds in the city were ballooning in anticipation of Wednesday night's Sugar Bowl college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome between Georgia and Notre Dame.  Kirkpatrick said police officers would work to ensure safety at the Sugar Bowl_ indicating that the game would go on as scheduled.  Kevin Garcia_ 22_ told CNN that he saw a truck slamming into people on a sidewalk and heard gunshots.  “A body came flying at me_” he said.  Whit Davis told the network that he heard people yelling and running to the back as he was leaving a nightclub.  “When they finally let us out of the club_ police waved us where to walk and were telling us to get out of the area fast. I saw a few dead bodies they couldn’t even cover up and tons of people receiving first aid_" said Davis_ 22.  The injured were taken to five hospitals_ the city’s emergency preparedness department said.  The White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed_ and the Justice Department said Attorney General Merrick Garland was also briefed.  The attack is the latest example of a vehicle being used as a weapon to carry out mass violence_ a trend that has alarmed law enforcement officials and that can be difficult to protect against.  A 50-year-old Saudi doctor plowed into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg last month_ killing four women and a 9-year-old boy. A man who drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee in 2021 is serving a life sentence after a judge rejected arguments from him and his family that mental illness drove him to do it. Six people were killed.  An Islamic extremist was sentenced last year to 10 life sentences for killing eight people with a truck on a bike path in Manhattan on Halloween in 2017. Also in 2017_ a self-proclaimed admirer of Adolf Hitler slammed his car into counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville_ Virginia and is now serving a life sentence.

Each January brings a quiet promise -- an invitation to start fresh_ to grow and to live more fully. Approach that promise with open hearts and gentle determination.  The new year often tempts us to aim for perfection -- to craft long lists of resolutions and demand drastic change overnight. But life isn’t about perfection. It’s about progress. It’s about showing up every day_ no matter how imperfectly_ and doing the best with what is available. This year_ focus on the idea that small_ steady steps forward are just as powerful as giant leaps.  Think about where you are right now. Challenges once thought impossible have already been overcome. Those triumphs_ both big and small_ are the foundation for the year ahead_ proof that anything can be tackled. It’s a cinch by the inch and a trial by the mile.  When setting goals this year_ start by asking yourself what makes you smile. What brings you joy and purpose? Instead of striving for external markers of success_ consider deeper goals that align with your values. Perhaps it’s cultivating more meaningful relationships_ prioritizing self-care or finding moments of gratitude in each day. Success isn’t about doing more; it’s about living more fully.  Give yourself permission to rest. The world often glorifies busyness_ but rest is essential. It’s in those quiet moments of reflection and renewal that clarity and strength are found. Allow yourself the grace to recharge. Rest isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s an act of self-compassion.  Redefine how setbacks are viewed. They aren’t failures but opportunities to learn and grow. Every stumble is a step closer to understanding_ every detour a chance to discover new paths. Be patient with yourself. Growth takes time_ and every effort counts. Celebrate progress_ no matter how small_ and trust that movement is happening in the right direction.  Remember the power of connection. Life isn’t meant to be navigated alone. Reach out to loved ones_ nurture relationships and lean on your support system when needed. Just as importantly_ extend kindness to those around you. A simple act of compassion can ripple outward in ways unimaginable_ making the world a brighter place for everyone.  Standing on the threshold of this new beginning_ choose hope over fear_ resilience over doubt_ and grace over judgment. Commit to living with intention_ savoring the present and embracing the messy_ beautiful journey of growth.

277564124,Gypsy-Rose Blanchard is officially a mom.   The reality TV star_ 33 — whose experience as a victim of Munchausen by proxy made national headlines — and her boyfriend Ken Urker have welcomed their first baby together_ a daughter named Aurora Raina Urker.   Urker shared a snap of the new mom cradling their baby in an Instagram post on Wednesday_ Jan. 1_ with the caption_ "Welcoming 2025 with the greatest gift of all 👼."   The photo shows Blanchard laying in a hospital bed as she and Urker hold their newborn. The two parents are looking down lovingly at their baby_ who is wearing a pink hat.   Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.    While chatting with PEOPLE in December_ Blanchard said that she can't take credit for her baby girl's name.   "Ken came up with that_" she said of Urker's idea to name their daughter Aurora Raina. "There's a whole backstory to it."   "Some people think that it's because of the Disney princess_" said Blanchard_ referencing Sleeping Beauty. Into her early 20s_ Blanchard was made to believe she was a child_ and made frequent trips to Disney parks due to fraudulent claims her mother made to children's charities.   "Some people think that it's because Kristy's dog is named Aurora Grace_" Blanchard said of her stepmom. "It's not because of that." The name_ she explained_ was inspired by something else.   The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!   "Back whenever Ken and I were together seven years ago_ both of us have a fascination with the Northern Lights_ and the proper term is the Aurora Borealis_" she shared of when she and Urker first dated during her prison stay. (Blanchard spent eight years in prison for her role in the 2015 murder of her mother Dee Dee_ who subjected her daughter to years of painful medical procedures she never needed.)   "I think it was maybe in 2018_ we wrote each other's future kid's name on pieces of paper and Aurora is what we both picked without even knowing each other was picking it_" Blanchard recalled.   She said they held on to that name and that memory even after she and Urker split and she married Ryan Anderson. "When we had broken up [it was like] 'Oh_ Aurora is never going to be born.' A lot of people think the origin is one thing_ but they don't know that little story."   Now back together with Urker and officially divorced from Anderson_ Blanchard is happy to be nesting and making meaningful plans for her growing family. "Some day we're going to see it_" she said of the natural light display that inspired their baby name choice. "After I'm off parole we're going to go. We're going to go to Sweden."   "For this upcoming year_ I'm really excited just to kind of obviously bring her into the world and have a lot of family time together_" said Blanchard_ author of new memoir My Time to Stand. "Obviously_ I'll be celebrating being off of parole_ so Kristy and dad are going to be the babysitter while Ken and I go to a nice vacation somewhere."   Blanchard and Urker first shared in July that they're expecting their first baby together after having rekindled their romance. Blanchard had filed to divorce her estranged husband Ryan Anderson in April.   Blanchard took a renatal paternity test and publicly confirmed on Nov. 5 that Urker is the father of her baby and not Anderson.
277524696,KYIV_ Ukraine — Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers that pass through the country_ almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor_ after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of last year.  At a summit in Brussels last month_ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn "additional billions ... on our blood_ on the lives of our citizens." But he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.  Ukraine's energy minister_ Herman Halushchenko_ confirmed on Wednesday morning that Kyiv had stopped the transit "in the interest of national security."  "This is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses. Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas_ and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today_" Halushchenko said in an update on the Telegram messaging app.  Russia's Gazprom said in a statement on Wednesday morning that it "has no technical and legal possibility" of sending gas through Ukraine_ due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.  Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in 2022_ Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country's pipeline network — set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union — to Europe_ under a five-year agreement. Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.  Before the war_ Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems_ one under the Baltic Sea_ one through Belarus and Poland_ one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.  After the war started_ Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines_ citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage_ but details of the attack remain murky.  The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship_ not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the U.S. filled the gap_ becoming the two largest suppliers.  Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. The move  Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023_ according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia_ which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.  Gazprom halted supplies to Austria's OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute_ but gas flows through Ukraine's pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan_ and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.  Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova_ which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.  Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire_ Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1_ citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies_ a figure the country has fiercely disputed_ citing international audits.  Moldova_ Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.  On Wednesday_ Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a "victory" for Russia's opponents. On a post on X_ Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to "blackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies_" including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany.  Moscow can still send gas to Hungary_ as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia_ through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.  Natural gas is used to generate electricity_ power industrial processes_ and in some cases to heat homes.  Separately_ overnight into New Year's Day_ Russia launched a drone strike on Kyiv that left two people dead under the rubble of a damaged building_ according to the city administration. At least six people were wounded across the Ukrainian capital_ according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.
277570574,President-elect Donald Trump denounced the New Orleans truck attack that left 10 people dead in the early hours of New Year’s Day as an “act of pure evil” — and implied the suspect had entered the US illegally.  “When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country_ that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media_ but it turned out to be true_” Trump_ 78_ posted on his Truth Social. “The crime rate in our country is at a level that nobody has ever seen before.”  “Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones_ including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!” the incoming president vowed.  This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

277747050,NEW ORLEANS -- A U.S. Army veteran driving a pickup that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wrought carnage on New Orleans' raucous New Year's celebration_ killing 15 people as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.  The FBI said it is investigating the attack early Wednesday as a terrorist act and does not believe the driver acted alone. Investigators found guns and what appeared to be an improvised explosive device in the vehicle_ along with other devices elsewhere in the city's famed French Quarter.  President Joe Biden said Wednesday evening that the FBI found videos that the driver had posted to social media hours before the attack in which he said he was inspired by the Islamic State group and expressed a desire to kill.  The rampage turned festive Bourbon Street into a macabre mayhem of maimed victims_ bloodied bodies and pedestrians fleeing for safety inside nightclubs and restaurants. In addition to the dead_ dozens of people were hurt. A college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome was postponed until Thursday.  The victims included Ni'Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux_ 18_ of Gulfport_ Miss._ who was set to start nursing school this month; Reggie Hunter_ 37_ a warehouse manager from Baton Rouge and father of two; and Tiger Bech_ a standout Louisiana high school athlete who played college football at Princeton University.  "Love you always brother!" Jack Bech_ Bech's brother and a football player at Texas Christian University_ wrote in a social media post about his family's loss. "You inspired me everyday now you get to be with me in every moment."  Dr. Dwight McKenna_ the New Orleans coroner_ said in an interview Wednesday evening that the number of fatalities could increase in the days ahead.  Zion Parsons_ 18_ of Gulfport_ Miss._ said he saw the truck "barreling through_ throwing people like in a movie scene_ throwing people into the air."  "Bodies_ bodies all up and down the street_ everybody screaming and hollering_" said Parsons_ whose friend Nikyra Dedeaux was among the people killed.  Video clips posted by witnesses on social media showed Bourbon Street emptied of crowds_ who had fled as the attack unfolded. Bodies of victims lay sprawled in the street_ near gutters littered with empty cups and broken strands of colorful Mardi Gras beads. Stunned bystanders looked down from second-floor balconies.  The attack_ by an assailant "set on hurting as many people as he could_" had targeted an area where crowds can be found at any hour_ said Jason Williams_ the district attorney who represents New Orleans.  "New Orleans is a place that doesn't close_" Williams said_ adding: "There's always people_ there's always people out."  As law enforcement officers swept through the French Quarter searching out suspicious packages and other potential threats and evidence Wednesday_ authorities urged the public to send tips to aid in the investigation_ and vowed to track down everyone involved in the attack.  For residents watching events unfold_ the day felt both frightening and surreal. Brian O'Brien_ 57_ a tour guide who lives a block from Bourbon Street_ said he woke Wednesday to find a state trooper inspecting a cooler about 100 feet from his stoop. According to O'Brien_ the officer said the cooler contained pipes_ tape and lots of nails_ and a bomb squad arrived soon after to detonate the contents.  O'Brien recalled hearing a shout of_ "Fire in the hole!" while he sat_ with his ears covered_ at a safe distance. "I'm still in shock_" he said.  "This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil_" New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said.  The driver "defeated" safety measures in place to protect pedestrians_ Kirkpatrick said_ and was "hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did."  The FBI identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Jabbar_ 42_ a U.S. citizen from Texas_ and said it is working to determine his potential associations with terrorist organizations.  "We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible_" FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan said at a news conference.  Investigators found multiple improvised explosives_ including two pipe bombs concealed within coolers and wired for remote detonation_ according to a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.  The bulletin_ relying on preliminary information gathered soon after the attack_ also said surveillance footage showed three men and a woman placing one of the devices_ but federal officials did not immediately confirm that detail and it wasn't clear who they were or what connection they had to the attack_ if any.  Jabbar drove a rented pickup onto a sidewalk_ going around a police car that was positioned to block vehicular traffic_ authorities said. A barrier system meant to prevent vehicle attacks was being repaired in preparation for the Super Bowl in February.  Jabbar was killed by police after he exited the truck and opened fire on responding officers_ Kirkpatrick said. Three officers returned fire. Two were shot and are in stable condition.  Investigators recovered a handgun and AR-style rifle_ according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  There were also deadly explosions in Honolulu and outside a Las Vegas hotel owned by President-elect Donald Trump. Biden said the FBI is looking into whether the Las Vegas explosion was connected to the New Orleans attack but had "nothing to report" as of Wednesday evening.  A photo circulated among law enforcement officials showed a bearded Jabbar wearing camouflage next to the truck after he was killed. The intelligence bulletin obtained by the AP said he was wearing a ballistic vest and helmet. The flag of the Islamic State group was on the truck's trailer hitch_ the FBI said.  "For those people who don't believe in objective evil_ all you have to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning_" U.S. Sen. John Kennedy_ a Louisiana Republican_ said. "If this doesn't trigger the gag reflex of every American_ every fair-minded American_ I'll be very surprised."  Jabbar joined the Army in 2007_ serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010_ the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.  Jabbar had converted to Islam and acted erratically in recent months_ said Dwayne Marsh_ who married Jabbar's ex-wife. Records showed that he had been married twice and had reported financial problems to his ex-wife's lawyer in 2022.  Before authorities identified the driver as an American citizen and an Army veteran_ some early reports suggested the vehicle had come across the border from Mexico. President-elect Donald Trump quickly asserted on social media that his condemnations of immigrants in the country without legal permission had been validated.  "When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country_ that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media_ but it turned out to be true_" Trump said on his website_ Truth Social.  Attorney General Merrick Garland said federal investigators were treating the attack as an act of terrorism. The use of the truck as a weapon_ along with the discovery of an improvised bomb in a cooler near the crashed vehicle_ led officials to conclude that the driver's goal had been to inflict civilian casualties.  "My heart is broken for those who began their year by learning people they love were killed in this horrific attack_" Garland said. He vowed to "deploy every available resource" to the investigation.  Hours after the attack_ several coroner's office vans were parked on the corner of Bourbon and Canal streets_ cordoned off by police tape with crowds of dazed tourists standing around_ some trying to navigate their luggage through the labyrinth of blockades.  Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry urged people to avoid the area_ which remained an active crime scene.  "We looked out our front door and saw caution tape and dead silence and it's eerie_" said Tessa Cundiff_ an Indiana native who moved to the French Quarter a few years ago. "This is not what we fell in love with_ it's sad."  Nearby_ life went on as normal in the city known to some for a motto that translates to "let the good times roll." At a cafe a block from where the truck came to rest_ people crowded in for breakfast as upbeat pop music played. Two blocks away_ people drank at a bar_ seemingly as if nothing happened.  Biden_ speaking from the presidential retreat at Camp David_ called the attack a "despicable" and "heinous act." Addressing the victims and the people of New Orleans_ he said: "I want you to know I grieve with you. Our nation grieves with you as you mourn and as you heal."  "My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday_" Biden said in an earlier written statement. "There is no justification for violence of any kind_ and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities."  The attack is the latest example of a vehicle being used as a weapon to carry out mass violence and the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years.  FBI officials have repeatedly warned about an elevated international terrorism threat due to the Israel-Hamas war. In the last year_ the agency has disrupted other potential attacks_ including in October when it arrested an Afghan man in Oklahoma for a supposed Election Day plot targeting large crowds.

The suspect died at the scene.  According to the president_ the FBI has found that the alleged killer_ Shamsud-Din Jabbar_ was an American citizen born in Texas.  “He served in the United States Army on active duty for many years; he also served in the Army reserve until a few years ago_” he said.  “The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack_ he posted videos on social media_ indicating he was inspired by ISIS_ expressing a desire to kill.”  Biden noted that an ISIS flag was found in the rented vehicle used for the attack. Explosives were also found in the truck and nearby.

277792900,The person who authorities believe died in the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters outside President-elect Donald Trump’s Las Vegas hotel was an active-duty U.S. Army soldier_ three U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Thursday.   Two law enforcement officials identified the man inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck as Matthew Livelsberger. The law enforcement officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.   Three U.S. officials said Livelsberger was an active-duty Army member_ who spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg_ a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to Army special forces command. The officials also spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of his service.   The truck explosion came hours after a driver_ 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar_ rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day_ killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone.  Jabbar_ a U.S. Army veteran_ also spent time at Fort Bragg_ but one official said so far there is no overlap in their assignments there.

277703846,NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A U.S. Army veteran who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year’s revelers in New Orleans_ killing 15 people_ had posted videos to social media hours before the carnage saying he was inspired by the Islamic State group and expressing a desire to kill_ the president said.  The FBI said it was investigating early Wednesday’s attack in which the driver steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police as a terrorist act and did not believe he acted alone.   Investigators found guns and what appeared to be an improvised explosive device in the vehicle — which bore the flag of the Islamic State group — along with other explosive devices elsewhere in the city’s famed French Quarter.  President Joe Biden said Wednesday evening that the FBI found the videos the driver posted to social media. He called the attack a “despicable” and “heinous act.”   The rampage turned festive Bourbon Street into a macabre scene of maimed victims_ bloodied bodies and pedestrians fleeing for safety inside nightclubs and restaurants. In addition to the dead_ dozens of people were hurt. A college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome was postponed until Thursday.  Zion Parsons_ 18_ of Gulfport_ Mississippi_ said he saw the truck “barreling through_ throwing people like in a movie scene_ throwing people into the air.”  “Bodies_ bodies all up and down the street_ everybody screaming and hollering_” said Parsons_ whose friend Nikyra Dedeaux was among the people killed.  “This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil_” New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said.  The attack is the latest example of a vehicle being used as a weapon to carry out mass violence and the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years.   The driver “defeated” safety measures in place to protect pedestrians_ Kirkpatrick said_ and was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”  The FBI identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Jabbar_ 42_ a U.S. citizen from Texas_ and said it was working to determine any potential associations with terrorist organizations.  “We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible_” FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan said at a news conference.  Investigators found multiple improvised explosives_ including two pipe bombs that were concealed within coolers and wired for remote detonation_ according to a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.  The bulletin_ relying on preliminary information gathered soon after the attack_ also cited surveillance footage that it said showed three men and a woman placing one of the devices_ but federal officials did not immediately confirm that detail and it wasn’t clear who they were or what connection they had to the attack_ if any.  Jabbar drove a rented pickup truck onto a sidewalk_ going around a police car that was positioned to block vehicular traffic_ authorities said. A barrier system meant to prevent vehicle attacks was being repaired in preparation for the Super Bowl in February.  Jabbar was killed by police after he exited the truck and opened fire on responding officers_ Kirkpatrick said. Three officers returned fire. Two were shot and are in stable condition.  Investigators recovered a handgun and AR-style rifle_ according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  There were also deadly explosions in Honolulu and outside a Las Vegas hotel owned by President-elect Donald Trump. President Joe Biden said the FBI was looking into whether the Las Vegas explosion was connected to the New Orleans attack but had “nothing to report” as of Wednesday evening.  A photo circulated among law enforcement officials showed a bearded Jabbar wearing camouflage next to the truck after he was killed. The intelligence bulletin obtained by the AP said he was wearing a ballistic vest and helmet. The flag of the Islamic State group was on the truck’s trailer hitch_ the FBI said.  “For those people who don’t believe in objective evil_ all you have to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning_” U.S. Sen. John Kennedy_ a Louisiana Republican_ said. “If this doesn’t trigger the gag reflex of every American_ every fair-minded American_ I’ll be very surprised.”  Jabbar joined the Army in 2007_ serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010_ the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.  Hours after the attack_ several coroner’s office vans were parked on the corner of Bourbon and Canal streets_ cordoned off by police tape with crowds of dazed tourists standing around_ some trying to navigate their luggage through the labyrinth of blockades.  Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry urged people to avoid the area_ which remained an active crime scene.  “We looked out our front door and saw caution tape and dead silence and it’s eerie_” said Tessa Cundiff_ an Indiana native who moved to the French Quarter a few years ago. “This is not what we fell in love with_ it’s sad.”  Nearby_ life went on as normal in the city known to some for a motto that translates to “let the good times roll.” At a cafe a block from where the truck came to rest_ people crowded in for breakfast as upbeat pop music played. Two blocks away_ people drank at a bar_ seemingly as if nothing happened.  Biden_ speaking from the presidential retreat at Camp David_ addressed the victims and the people of New Orleans: “I want you to know I grieve with you. Our nation grieves with you as you mourn and as you heal.”  “My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday_” Biden said in an earlier written statement. “There is no justification for violence of any kind_ and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities.”  FBI officials have repeatedly warned about an elevated international terrorism threat due to the Israel-Hamas war. In the last year_ the agency has disrupted other potential attacks_ including in October when it arrested an Afghan man in Oklahoma for an alleged Election Day plot targeting large crowds.  Tucker reported from Washington_ D.C. and Mustian reported from Black Mountain_ North Carolina. Associated Press reporters Stephen Smith_ Chevel Johnson and Brett Martel in New Orleans; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; Alanna Durkin Richer_ Tara Copp and Zeke Miller in Washington_ D.C.; Darlene Superville in New Castle_ Delaware; Colleen Long in West Palm Beach_ Florida; and Michael R.

277920904,U.S. President Joe Biden has decided to block Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion takeover bid of U.S. Steel_ The Washington Post reported on Friday_ citing two unnamed administrative officials who did not have permission to speak about the matter.  The White House is expected to announce Biden’s decision as soon as Friday_ according to The Washington Post.  The decision on whether to let the deal proceed was referred to Biden on Dec. 23 after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States failed to reach a consensus_ said U.S. Steel.  Biden had 15 days to approve or block the deal after the CFIUS evaluation reached his desk_ which prompted Nippon Steel to extend the transaction’s deadline to the first quarter of 2025 from the third or fourth quarter of 2024.  The CFIUS was concerned that_ following the acquisition_ Nippon Steel could cut the production capacity of U.S. Steel_ which would pose a risk to the national security of the United States.  “Potential reduced output by U.S. Steel could lead to supply shortages and delays that could affect industries critical to national security_” The Washington Post reported the CFIUS as stating in its evaluation.  To assuage that worry_ Nippon Steel on Tuesday offered the U.S. government the ability to veto any reductions to the company’s steel production.  Nippon Steel had previously offered a number of concessions regarding the transaction_ such as keeping U.S. Steel headquartered in Pittsburgh_ Pennsylvania_ and staffing the board of directors of U.S. Steel with U.S. citizens.  The deal was backed by U.S. Steel shareholders_ who voted in April for it to go through.  “The overwhelming support from our stockholders is a clear endorsement that they recognize the compelling rationale for our transaction with NSC_” said U.S. Steel President and CEO David B. Burritt.  But those factors were not enough to sway Biden_ who has long publicly opposed the deal. In March_ Biden released an official statement saying that “it is vital for [U.S. Steel] to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.”   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also voiced his resistance to Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition.  “I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company_ in this case Nippon Steel of Japan_” Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Dec. 2.  Japan-listed Nippon Steel shares were last up 1.2% at 1 a.m. Eastern Time.  — CNBC’s Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.

277897762,SEOUL_ South Korea (AP) — South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a nearly six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It’s the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.  The country’s anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon’s residence for hours due to concerns about their safety. The agency expressed “serious regret about the attitude of the suspect_ who did not respond to a process by law.”  Yoon_ a former prosecutor_ has defied investigators’ attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12_ when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation_ making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.  Investigators from the country’s anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon_ apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament_ declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.  Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14_ accusing him of rebellion_ while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.   A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday_ but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.   Yoon’s lawyers_ who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday_ say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.   The office said it will discuss further actions_ but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.  Yoon’s lawyers have also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials_ which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators_ lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said that police officers don’t have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon_ and could face arrest by either the “presidential security service or any citizens.” They didn’t elaborate further on the claim.   If investigators manage to detain Yoon_ they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise_ he will be released after 48 hours.  Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon’s residence on Friday_ forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved subfreezing temperatures for hours_ waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans vowing to protect him. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.  Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon’s detention_ but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon’s lawyers_ Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il_ were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn’t immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.   Seok Dong-hyeon_ one of several lawyers on Yoon’s legal team_ said the agency’s efforts to detain Yoon were “reckless” and showed an “outrageous discard for law.”  South Korea’s Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service_ which controls the residence itself_ refused to comment. South Korea’s YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.   As the standoff prologned_ the liberal opposition Democratic Party called on the country’s acting leader_ Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok_ to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn’t immediately comment on the situation.   “Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime_” said Jo Seung-lae_ a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must “remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility_” Jo said.   Yoon’s defense minister_ police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.  Yoon’s presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court_ which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office.  The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo_ who became acting president after Yoon’s powers were suspended_ over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of Yoon’s case.   Facing growing pressure_ the new acting president_ Choi_ appointed two new justices on Tuesday_ which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon’s impeachment.

278091578,By MICHAEL R. SISAK and JENNIFER PELTZ  NEW YORK (AP) — In an extraordinary turn_ a judge Friday set President-elect Donald Trump’s sentencing in his hush money case for Jan. 10 — little over a week before he’s due to return to the White House — but promised not to jail him.  The development marks yet another twist in the singular case.  Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in 2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong.  After Trump’s Nov. 5 election_ Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.  Trump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would otherwise pose unconstitutional “disruptions” to the incoming president’s ability to run the country.  Prosecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency_ but they insisted the conviction should stand.  They suggested various options_ such as freezing the case during his term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal defendants die while appealing their cases.  Trump takes office Jan. 20.
277887610,Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit filed over its Siri voice assistant_ according to a newly filed court document.  Lawyers for people who sued Apple after they said Siri recorded their conversations and shared the conversations with advertisers told a federal court in California that Apple does not oppose their proposed settlement_ which features a payment of $95 million.  Plaintiffs said that some of their conversations in their home that should not have been recorded were used by Apple and its partners to target them with advertisements for Olive Garden_ Air Jordans_ and other products.  “Because the intercepted conversations took place in private to the exclusion of others_ only through Apple’s surreptitious recording could these specific advertisements be pinpointed to Plaintiffs Lopez and A.L_” the suit stated.  Apple said in filings that Siri lets users know when it is recording and that the court should dismiss the suit.  A federal judge only threw out part of the suit_ leading to the new proposed settlement.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the court should certify a class that includes all people who own or owned a Siri device_ live in the United States and its territories_ and whose confidential communications were obtained by Apple “as a result of unintended Siri activation” between Sept. 17_ 2014_ and the date of the settlement. The former date is when Apple introduced the “Hey_ Siri_” activation feature.  A notice sent to owners and former owners would direct them to submit a claim form through a website to get a chunk of the $95 million.  The lawyers for the plaintiffs can seek up to $29.6 million for fees and expenses_ according to the proposed settlement.  As part of the settlement_ Apple will confirm within six months that it has permanently deleted Siri audio recordings collected by the company prior to October 2019. Apple must also post a webpage explaining how users can opt in to an option to improve Siri on Siri devices_ and detailing what information Apple stores from users who decide to opt in.  Apple and a lawyer representing the plaintiffs did not return The Epoch Times’ requests for comment.  U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White must still approve the settlement.

Coach Sean McDermott has already said he plans to rest numerous starters_ with Josh Allen scheduled to take the first offensive snap — and not many more — for the purpose of extending his consecutive games starting streak to 115 (including playoffs). That means Trubisky will get his most extensive opportunity to run the offense this season.

Buffalo has matched the NFL single-season record with 13 players scoring at least one touchdown receiving.  Patriots player to watch  QB Drake Maye. He has thrown a touchdown pass in eight consecutive games_ the longest streak by a rookie in franchise history. He also has a 66.8% completion rate so far.

The Bills are 8-2 in their past 10 meetings_ including the playoffs_ in a stretch that coincides with Tom Brady leaving New England for Tampa Bay following the 2019 season.

The Bills have already set single-season records for most points (509)_ touchdowns scored (63) and 40-point outings (four). ... Since 2018_ Buffalo has scored 40 or more points 13 times with Allen starting — and 14 including a 2018 start by backup Matt Barkley.

The Patriots are 2-6 in one-score games this season. ... Maye has at least one turnover in eight consecutive games. ... TE Hunter Henry enters the week fifth on New England’s list among tight ends with 19 TD catches. With one more he will be the fifth Patriots tight end to reach 20. ... S/ST Brendan Schooler was the lone player selected to the initial Pro Bowl Games roster. He has a team-leading nine special teams tackles this season.

278439046,WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees_ affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers_ firefighters_ police officers and in other public service jobs.  Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity_ though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds_ which face a looming insolvency crisis.   The bill rescinds two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources_ including public retirement programs from a state or local government.  The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023_ there were 745_679 people_ about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries_ who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people_ or about 3% of all beneficiaries_ were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380_000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses_ according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1_190 for 390_000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.  Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security’s regular cost-of-living adjustments.  The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond_ meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner “shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account” changes in the law. It’s not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.  Edward Kelly_ president of the International Association of Fire Fighters_ said firefighters across the country are “excited to see the change — we’ve righted a 40-year wrong.” Kelly said the policy was “far more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.”  The IAFF has roughly 320_000 members_ which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.   “Now firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire_” Kelly said.  Sherrod Brown_ who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years_ lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders_ president of the American Federation of State_ County and Municipal Employees labor union_ thanked Brown for his advocacy.  “Over two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into_” Saunders said in a statement. “Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.”  National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is “a historic victory that will improve the lives of educators_ first responders_ postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.”   And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation_ others_ including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota_ Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina_ voted against it. “We caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis_” Tillis told The Associated Press last month.   Still_ Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees.  The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people_ including retirees_ disabled people and children_ receive Social Security benefits.   The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration_ which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency_ currently under a hiring freeze_ has a staff of about 56_645 — the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever.  The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program’s insolvency date by about half a year. ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.

278352964,Mars Conceals the Motive  The Mars retrograde emphasizes how useful it is to know what people want. The ones that tell you up front honor you with the directness of their honesty_ saving you time and making your options obvious. Those who hide what they want may want too much_ or they want something that is not in your best interest to give. As always_ heed intuition.  CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Originality will count for many points today and could make the difference between being chosen or not. Luckily_ uniqueness is your strength. No one else carries your exact blend of hopes_ memories or fears. What you have can’t be replicated.  AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Sometimes when you sense tensions that others don’t seem to be aware of_ you think you might be imagining it. You’re not imagining it. But it’s not just you who is sensitive to subtle conflicts. It’s just that no one is letting on.  PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Telling your story well will put you in a position to win friends and business. But beyond the connections_ storytelling is how you remind yourself of your own power and purpose. Others will listen_ root for you and see themselves in your success.  ARIES (March 21-April 19). Brevity flatters almost anything you pick up today. Make quick work of tasks and communications and you’ll breeze through the dutiful part of the day_ leaving plenty of room to stretch your time around the enjoyable parts.  TAURUS (April 20-May 20). Belonging isn’t about fitting together seamlessly_ rather it’s a willingness to seek harmony in the imperfect and tolerate the edges that don’t quite align. The ideal moment to start friendship is the moment you think to do it. Seize the day.  GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You trust the one you’re following. You trust the universe. You trust yourself. And yet_ moving forward still may seem a bit scary. It’s OK to fling your arms wide open and keep your eyes shut.  CANCER (June 22-July 22). Just a reminder: You’re inherently interesting and worthy_ so you don’t need impress anyone_ nor should you attempt to hide anything about yourself out of fear of being uncool. Embrace your quirks. They’re your superpower.  LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). A return on investment is not a selfish thing to want. Maybe you should even expect it today. After all_ you gave everything that was asked of you. If you gave in the right direction_ you’ll either get back or feel like you don’t need to.  VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). While you’re deeply moved by recent developments_ it feels incomplete unless you know someone else is sharing in the benefits. This is why you’ll reach out and share the bounty at every mile marker of your journey.  LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). A reputation is like a pet or a child. It’s called “yours_” but it has a life of its own. You didn’t create it_ and you don’t total control it_ but there’s much you can do to influence it. That’s the work of the day_ which you’re well equipped to take on to successful effect.  SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). You’re really onto something. And when you start to get a little tired_ push past it. The good stuff is on the other side_ after the slump and the arrival of your second wind.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). One way to rev up the stress levels is to think life should be something other than what it is. One way to calm the stress levels is to think the way things are is mighty fine with you_ and perhaps even mighty fine in general.  TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 5). Hard challenges are for you. Your drive to make a difference has you claiming them on purpose_ knowing you’re up for it_ sensing they’ll make you great -- and you’re right. With legendary resilience_ you’ll keep coming back to the task in a new way until you’ve figured it out. More highlights: an intriguing mystery_ tender connections_ and rewards that surpass your expectation. Scorpio and Pisces adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 8_ 13_ 39_ 2 and 1.

278549596,Lefty Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation from office this week_ according to a report.  Three sources told the Globe and Mail_ a Canadian outlet_ on Sunday that Trudeau_ 53_ could reveal he’s leaving as Liberal Party Leader before a critical national caucus meeting on Wednesday.  It was unclear what day he could announce his resignation_ but it reportedly could happen as early as Monday_ the sources said.  The bombshell report comes as an embattled Trudeau has faced increasing calls for his resignation as a Donald Trump presidency – and the threat of 25% tariffs on all products north of the border – looms large.  The prime minister was struck with a devastating blow after his then-finance minister_ Chrystia Freeland_ quit last month over a deepening divide between the two over the future of Canada’s economy.  One of the sources told the Globe and Mail Trudeau knows he needs to announce his resignation before the Liberal caucus meets on Wednesday so it doesn’t appear he was pushed out by his own members.  It was unknown if Trudeau_ who has led Canada for nearly a decade_ would stick around as prime minister until a new leader is picked or leave right away_ according to the outlet.  A fourth source said he would only step down because he believes the caucus no longer supports him and not because he doesn’t think he can still do the job.   The Liberal Party is widely expected to lose power to the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilevre in an election that must be held by late October based on public polling.  Trudeau has consistently been needled by Trump since the Republican won November’s presidential election. The incoming commander in chief even suggested Canada become the United States’ 51st state.

278629526,Before the 2021 riot_ Mr. Trump addressed his supporters at the Ellipse near the White House_ telling them: “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell_ you’re not going to have a country anymore_” encouraging them to march to the Capitol. In the end_ eight Senate Republicans and 139 House Republicans objected to certifying the election results.  This year_ Democrats and Republicans alike are hoping for a smooth process. House Republicans on Friday managed to put aside their divisions and re-elect Speaker Mike Johnson to his post_ in part because they wanted to ensure a smooth certification of Mr. Trump’s electoral victory.  And Democrats_ from the president on down_ have telegraphed that they plan to lead by example. Mr. Biden in November extended to Mr. Trump some of the traditions that he was deprived of four years earlier_ inviting the president-elect to the White House to acknowledge his victory and telling him that the administration would do “everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated_ have what you need.”  In her concession speech in November_ Ms. Harris said that she had spoken to Mr. Trump and “congratulated him on his victory” and “told him that we will help him and his team with their transition.”  On Monday_ Ms. Harris will take on the largely ceremonial role that four years ago put Mr. Pence in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump and the mob of his supporters_ some of whom chanted “hang Mike Pence” as they marched through the Capitol.

Zendaya and Holland_ both 28_ confirmed their romance when they were spotted kissing in July 2021 — years after being cast as love interests in 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”  They have been the subject of engagement speculation several times_ with Zendaya herself speaking out about the rumors in 2023 after fans were convinced they took the next step when she shared a selfie with a ring on that finger.   “I can’t post anything … I posted [the photo] for my hat_ like_ not for the ring on my right finger you guys!” she clarified in a since-deleted video. “Seriously_ you think that’s how I would drop the news?”  Notably_ the Disney Channel alum has worn a ring on her left ring finger multiple times_ including for her April 2024 Vogue cover.  While it’s no secret they’re head over heels for one another_ Zendaya has previously explained why she prefers to keep her romance with the “Uncharted” actor private.   “Parts of my life_ I accept_ are going to be public. I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love_” she told Elle in 2023. “But also_ I do have control over what I choose to share.  “It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun_ either. I am navigating it more than ever now.”  Holland did not attend the Golden Globes with Zendaya_ who is nominated for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture musical or comedy for her role in “Challengers.”  He explained why he doesn’t usually walk red carpets with her in his Men’s Health cover story released this week.  “It’s not my moment_ it’s her moment_ and if we go together_ it’s about us_” he said.   Zendaya arrived at the Golden Globes in a satin burnt-orange dress from Louis Vuitton. She styled her hair in a bob with Old Hollywood curls.   After her “Challengers” nomination was announced in December 2024_ she gushed that her “heart was so full.”  “I’m so deeply grateful to be nominated among such incredible talent_” she added. “I admire each one of them and their absolutely brilliant work.”

278666352,WASHINGTON (AP) — Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s decision to block a proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel..  The suit_ filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia_ alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies’ due process.   “From the outset of the process_ both Nippon Steel and U. S. Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the Transaction will enhance_ not threaten_ United States national security_ including by revitalizing communities that rely on American steel_ bolstering the American steel supply chain_ and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry against the threat from China_” the companies said in a prepared statement Monday. “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”  Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel’s aging blast furnace operations in Gary_ Indiana_ and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers_ our nation is less strong and less secure_” he said in a statement.   While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to Japan’s relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S. president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm.   Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks.   The president’s decision to block the deal comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States_ known as CFIUS_ failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month_ and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15 days to reach a final decision.  In a separate lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania_ the companies accused steel-making rival Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and its CEO_ Lourenco Goncalves of “engaging in a coordinated series of anticompetitive and racketeering activities” to block the deal.   In 2023 before U.S. Steel accepted the buyout offer from Nippon_ Cleveland-Cliffs offered to buy U.S. Steel for $7 billion. U.S. Steel turned the offer down and ended up accepting the nearly $15 billion all-cash offer from Nippon Steel_ which is the deal that Biden nixed Friday.
278559218,Demi Moore delivered an emotional acceptance speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday_ expressing gratitude at finally feeling acknowledged by the industry after years of work.The iconic actor took to the stage to accept the award for Best Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical/Comedy for her leading role in body horror film The Substance. It was a highly competitive category as well_ with Moore beating out Amy Adams (Nightbitch)_ Cynthia Erivo (Wicked)_ Karla Sofía Gascón (Emilia Pérez)_ Mikey Madison (Anora)_ and Zendaya (Challengers).   Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley channel 'The Substance' at the Golden Globes  "I'm just in shock right now_" said Moore. "I've been doing this a long time_ like over 45 years_ and this is the first time I've ever won anything as an actor."Moore's claim isn't strictly true_ though her list of accolades is admittedly sparse. The actor's performance in Ghost won her the Saturn Award for Best Actress in 1991_ and the Indiana Film Journalists Association awarded her Best Lead Performance for The Substance late last year. She was also part of Margin Call's ensemble win at the 2012 Independent Spirit Awards.Even so_ tonight's Golden Globe marks Moore's first major solo win throughout her entire acting career.   window.videoEmbeds = window.videoEmbeds || [];  window.videoEmbeds.push({  elemId: 'video-container-9SvW3XJP5Ic'_  data: {"slug":"9SvW3XJP5Ic"_"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9SvW3XJP5Ic"_"start_time":""}_  videoPlayerType: 'in-content'  "Thirty years ago I had a producer tell me that I was a 'popcorn actress' and at that time I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have_" said a teary Moore. "That I could do movies that were successful_ that made a lot of money_ but that I couldn't be acknowledged. And I bought in and I believed that. "And that corroded me over time to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete. Maybe I'd done what I was supposed to do."Moore shared that she had been at a "low point" when she was presented with The Substance's script_ "and the universe told me that 'you're not done.'""In those moments when we don't think we're smart enough_ or pretty enough_ or skinny enough_ or successful enough_ or basically just not enough_" said Moore. "I had a woman say to me_ 'Just know_ you will never be enough. But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.'"You can check out all the Golden Globes winners in Mashable's list.
278676056,After a disappointing 2024 season_ the Jacksonville Jaguars decided it was time for a change.  The Jaguars fired head coach Doug Pederson on Monday after finishing the year with a 4-13 record_ ending his tenure after three seasons.  "Doug is an accomplished football man who will undoubtedly enjoy another chapter in his impressive NFL career_ and I will be rooting for Doug and his wife Jeannie when that occasion arrives_" team owner Shad Khan said. "As much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better_ I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans_ who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded. In that spirit_ the time to summon new leadership is now."  That "new leadership" won't extend to the front office_ though_ with Khan citing how he intends to continue working with general manager Trent Baalke to right the ship this offseason.  Pederson was asked about his job status earlier in the season when Jacksonville lost its first four games and he took exception to the question_ responding_ "That's kind of a weird question_ but OK."  The questions about Pederson's standing came up again leading up to the team's Week 11 game against the Detroit Lions.  The Jaguars wound up suffering an embarrassing 52-6 loss. They had a bye in Week 12_ so that seemed like a good opportunity to make a change and get the interim coach acclimated before they returned to play against the Houston Texans. However_ Pederson was retained through the end of the year until the team decided it was finally time to move on from him.  Pederson's run with the Jaguars got off to a strong start after he was hired in 2022_ as he led the team to an AFC South title with a 9-8 record in his first year. The team overcame a 27-point deficit in its AFC Wild Card matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers to earn a 31-30 win_ the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. Jacksonville fell to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round that year.  Unfortunately_ the Jaguars failed to build off the promising start to Pederson's tenure. After opening the 2023 season with an 8-3 record_ Jacksonville lost five of its last six games to finish 9-8 for the second straight season_ which wasn't good enough to qualify for the playoffs this time around.  Khan told the team before training camp that "winning now is the expectation." The team failed to live up to that mandate throughout the season_ leading to the decision to part ways with Pederson.  Jacksonville must now find a replacement who can maximize the talents of star quarterback Trevor Lawrence_ who was limited to 10 games this season due to a shoulder injury.

279012756,Near the end of “A Complete Unknown_” the Bob Dylan biopic that centers on his move into rock in 1965_ an earnest_ slim_ bearded_ clearly nervous M.C. struggles to pacify a wildly divided crowd that has just heard Dylan sing three plugged-in songs at the Newport Folk Festival. Boomers will immediately recognize that M.C. as Peter Yarrow_ himself a festival headliner in the folk-revival trio Peter_ Paul and Mary.  Yarrow_ who died on Tuesday at 86_ was also a member of the Newport Folk Festival board that had been striving to balance the event’s founding mission — bringing traditional music to a wider audience — with the preferences of that wider audience_ which was more drawn to pop than purism. Among the festival organizers_ Yarrow was an advocate for the topical songwriting and contemporary sounds that some old-line folk aficionados resisted. (According to “White Bicycles” by the producer Joe Boyd_ who was running the sound system at Newport in 1965_ Yarrow was also at the control board during Bob Dylan’s loud_ divisive electric set_ and refused to turn it down as other board members demanded.) And in the early_ idealistic years of the folk revival_ Yarrow_ Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers (who died in 2009) strummed and harmonized their way toward that conscientious balance of folk and pop. It was sincere_ and fleeting.

279011086,Trump made the comments as he complained that the U.S. had a large trade deficit with both Mexico and Canada. He has raised similar concerns since winning November’s election and vowed to impose steep tariffs on both neighboring countries.  Both outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo have spoken with Trump in recent months about his tariff threats.  Trump on Tuesday bashed Mexico as a “very dangerous place” that was “essentially run by the cartels.”  He suggested Canada merge with the U.S. after Trudeau announced his resignation on Monday.
278804650,LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have settled their divorce and are asking a judge to finalize their breakup.  Lopez filed documents Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court that show the former couple settled their divorce through mediation in September_ about a month after she filed for divorce.  While most of the financial details of their split were not publicly filed_ neither star will pay the other spousal support. Lopez will drop Affleck from her legal name once the divorce is finalized.  The superstar couple married in July 2022. Lopez filed for divorce in August 2024_ although the couple said in court filings that they separated in April 2023.  After meeting_ falling in love and getting engaged in the early 2000s — and starring together in 2003’s infamous “Gigli” and 2004’s “Jersey Girl” — the couple parted ways_ blaming in part the pressure of the public eye.  But to the delight of many and perhaps the skepticism of others_ they reunited two decades later and married.  Records filed Monday show the pair resolved the financial aspects of their divorce through mediation and without long-drawn-out proceedings in court.  The couple have no children together. Affleck divorced Jennifer Garner_ with whom he has three children_ in 2018. Lopez has been married four times and has twins with singer Marc Anthony.  The settlement documents were first reported by celebrity website TMZ.  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

279013720,President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he wouldn’t rule out using “military force” to make Greenland and the Panama Canal US territories.  “No_ I can’t assure you on either of those two_” the incoming president told a reporter asking about the use of military force or economic coercion to acquire the territories.  “We need Greenland for national security purposes. I’ve been told that for a long time_ long before I even ran. I mean_ people have been talking about it for a long time. You have approximately 45_000 people there. People really don’t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it_ but if they do_ they should give it up_ because we need it for national security_” Trump said at his press conference at Mar-a-Lago.  He argued that there are Chinese and Russian ships around the world’s largest island and “we’re not letting that happen.”  He slammed former President Jimmy Carter for giving away the Panama Canal during his presidency and said he’s worried that China is controlling the waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
278953468,Richard Cohen_ a veteran journalist and the husband Meredith Vieira_ died on Christmas Eve at the age of 76 after living more than 50 years with multiple sclerosis and surviving two cancer diagnoses.   News of his death was announced on the Today show on Tuesday_ Jan. 7. Hoda Kotb said that he was "surrounded by his family and love" at the time of his death_ including Vieira and their three kids: daughter Lily_ 32_ and sons Gabriel 34_ and Benjamin_ 36.   All had been together around Thanksgiving_ Kotb noted_ "concerned they were going to lose him early. Instead_ they got a glorious month with their dad."   "She's in really good spirits_" Savannah Guthrie added_ of Vieira. "She was such a beautiful and devoted wife to Richard and he adored Meredith. And hanging out with them_ they were like the most fun and entertaining_ irreverent_ cool couple you could hang out with."   Cohen and Viera were married for 38 years_ tying the knot in 1986. Diagnosed with MS at the age of 25_ he famously told Vieira he had the chronic disease when they were on their second date.   “I told her about the illness_ because I sort of learned the hard way to get it on the table_" he recalled to Yahoo Life in 2019. "And she really didn’t blink."   I’ve always been of the school of thought that you could get hit by a bus the next day_ any one of us could_" said Vieira. "It certainly wasn’t enough to scare me off.”   Instead_ Vieira became Cohen's fiercest supporter. Over their near four decades together_ she stood by Cohen's side as he left his long reporting career for CBS News and became an advocate for those living with MS.   The chronic disease — which affects the central nervous system including the brain_ spinal cord_ and optic nerves — would eventually lead Vieira to step aside from her own career in broadcast journalism. An original co-host on The View_ she left the daytime talk show in 2006 to co-anchor today. She remaind on the program through 2011_ when she retired to spend more time with Cohen and their kids.   “Time is one of those weird things_" she said on air at the time. "You can never get enough of it_ and it just keeps ticking away. And I know that I want to spend more of mine with my husband_ Richard_ and my kids."   This is a developing story_ check back for more updates.
278835778,Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to remove special counsel Jack Smith from his post and either decline to release Smith's upcoming report detailing his investigations into the president-elect or hand over the matter to Trump's incoming administration_ according to a letter released Monday. The letter_ addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department_ alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his dual investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to "put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively." The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove_ Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his upcoming administration. Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect_ one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump_ which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing. The classified documents case was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida who ruled in July 2024 that Garland unlawfully appointed Smith_ a finding the Justice Department disputed and was appealing in the runup to the presidential election. The 2020 election-related charges against Trump were dismissed after Trump was re-elected. The special counsel wrote that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Federal regulations dictate that upon the completion of any special counsel probe_ the investigative team is to submit a report detailing its findings to the attorney general for review. Garland has previously pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and so far kept to that promise_ including after a separate special counsel_ Robert Hur_ submitted his findings about President Biden's handling of classified records. Mr. Biden's legal team raised objections to the attorney general over characterizations in that report_ which were rebuffed by Justice Department officials when the complete findings — including characterizations of Mr. Biden's age — were publicly released. Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration_ sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Following its submission_ the special counsel is expected to resign as other independent prosecutors have done_ the sources said. In Monday's letter_ Trump's attorneys revealed that they reviewed a draft of Smith's report over the last few days at the special counsel's office and raised objections_ arguing the preparation of a report would violate federal law related to official appointments and presidential transitions. "Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action_ you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed_ then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general_ consistent with the expressed will of the People_" Trump's attorneys wrote. They also said they would seek legal recourse should Garland deny their requests. Should Garland opt to hand over the report to Trump's incoming Justice Department for consideration_ as the letter suggested_ much of the decision-making could fall to the president-elect's current defense team who will hold key leadership positions within the department_ and his selection for attorney general_ former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Justice Department declined to comment. The letter to the attorney general was included as an exhibit in a simultaneous effort by Trump's former codefendants in the classified documents case to ask a court to intervene and stop the release of the special counsel's report. Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira asked Judge Aileen Cannon to stop the release of the report_ arguing they would "suffer harm as civilian casualties" to the case. The pair were charged alongside Trump as part of an alleged effort to obstruct the classified documents probe. Both men pleaded not guilty and in Monday's letter accused Smith of improper motivations. While Smith dropped his appeal of the case against Trump citing Justice Department policy_ he opted to keep going with the appeal in Nauta and de Oliveira's case in an effort to reverse the legal precedent created by Cannon's ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed. On Monday_ attorneys for the men turned to Cannon_ urging her to step in and stop the special counsel from completing his report. They alleged such a move would be improper after the judge had previously dismissed the case. They also contended any public release could affect the ongoing appeal and infringe on the defendants' rights. "The Final Report is meant to serve as a Government verdict against the Defendants contrary to all criminal justice norms and constitutional guideposts_" the attorneys wrote. "The filing of such a report_ by an unauthorized person_ is clearly improper in this context and will cause grave harm given the pendency of criminal proceedings_ now on appeal_ at counsel Smith's own insistence." A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment. The news comes days after a top lieutenant to the special counsel_ Jay Bratt_ retired from the Justice Department.

They are signing running back Ezekiel Elliott to their practice squad_ according to FOX Sports NFL insider Jordan Schultz. Before the final week of the regular season_ the Dallas Cowboys waived Elliott at his request.

279140036,“Our hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole_ Brian Matusz_” the Orioles said in a statement. “A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016_ Brian was beloved throughout Birdland_ and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could_ was a cherished teammate_ and always had a smile on his face. Brian’s family and loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.”  Matusz turned in his best season in 2014 when he had a 3.48 ERA and 53 strikeouts. He was traded to the Atlanta Braves in 2016_ and they designated him for assignment shortly thereafter. That led him to Chicago_ where he transitioned back to a starting role and made a spot start in July 2016 – his lone appearance. That proved to be the last game of his career_ and even though he only played in one game with the Cubs_ he still got a World Series ring when they ended their 108-year drought.  Before he arrived in Baltimore_ Matusz was selected by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2005 MLB Draft_ but he opted to go to college. He starred at the University of San Diego_ where he was a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award twice as he became the program’s all-time leader in strikeouts. He ended his career by winning the West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year award in 2008.

With a bit of luck I'll be able to say the same tomorrow too.  Today's Wordle hint  Wordle today: A hint for Wednesday_ January 8  A rough sketch shown to a client before the finished art is agreed on or a quickly typed essay to give a broad idea of the finished piece could be called this. Also a chilly breeze blowing through a room in US English.   Is there a double letter in Wordle today?   No_ there is not a double letter in today's puzzle.   Wordle help: 3 tips for beating Wordle every day   Playing Wordle well is like achieving a small victory every day—who doesn't like a well-earned winning streak in a game you enjoy? If you're new to the daily word game_ or just want a refresher_ I'm going to share a few quick tips to help set you on the path to success:   You want a balanced mix of unique consonants and vowels in your opening word. A solid second guess helps to narrow down the pool of letters quickly.The answer could contain letters more than once.  There's no time pressure beyond making sure it's done by the end of the day. If you're struggling to find the answer or a tactical word for your next guess_ there's no harm in coming back to it later on.   Today's Wordle answer  What is today's Wordle answer?  Need a little help? The answer to the January 8 (1299) Wordle is DRAFT.  Previous Wordle answers  The last 10 Wordle answers   Knowing previous Wordle solutions can be helpful in eliminating current possibilities. It's unlikely a word will be repeated and you can find inspiration for guesses or starting words that may be eluding you.   Here are some recent Wordle answers:  January 7: ATLASJanuary 6: SPRIGJanuary 5: CYBERJanuary 4: RELAXJanuary 3: CHEAPJanuary 2: CHOSEJanuary 1: NERVEDecember 31: LEMURDecember 30: STAREDecember 29: MAMBO  Learn more about Wordle   Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day_ and it's your job to work out which five-letter word is hiding by eliminating or confirming the letters it contains.  Starting with a strong word like LEASH—something containing multiple vowels_ common consonants_ and no repeat letters—is a good place to start. Once you hit Enter_ the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️_ it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word_ but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.  Your second go should compliment the starting word_ using another "good" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that_ it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).   If you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips_ and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used_ you can scroll to the relevant section above.  Originally_ Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle_ as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family_ and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle_ refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

Bush_ Barack Obama and Donald Trump -- are expected to join around 3_000 mourners at the service_ and Thursday has been designated a national day of mourning_ with federal offices closed.Carter_ who served a single term before a crushing election loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980_ was perceived as naive and weak in the dog-eat-dog world of Washington politic.A more nuanced image of him has emerged as the years passed_ reassessing achievements like the brokering of a peace deal between Israel and Egypt.He also received high praise for his post-presidential humanitarian efforts_ and a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.The first president to reach triple digits_ he had been in hospice care since February 2023 in his hometown of Plains_ Georgia_ where he died and will be buried next to his late wife_ former first lady Rosalynn Carter.Mourners begun paying their respects on Saturday_ as the carefully choreographed six-day farewell got underway with US flags flying at half-staff around the country.A black hearse bearing Carter's remains paused at his boyhood family peanut farm in Plains_ where a bell was rung 39 times and staff stood in silent tribute.Crowds gathered along the roadside to say their goodbyes_ snap photographs or salute as the motorcade rolled slowly past.Carter's flag-draped casket arrived at Washington's snow-covered US Capitol on Tuesday atop a gun carriage.It was accompanied by hundreds of service members_ with military pallbearers carrying Carter to the Rotunda to lie in state ahead of Thursday's ceremony -- the first presidential funeral since Bush Senior died in 2018.Chuck Schumer_ the leader of the Democrats in the Senate_ described Carter as "one of the most decent and humble public servants we have ever seen." "President Carter was a living embodiment of leadership through service_ compassion_ and a thirst for justice for all_" he said.
279575378,I used to hate Jimmy Carter more than anything else in this world.    Let me explain.   It’s November 1979 in Oak Harbor_ Washington_ and I’m counting days. 24_ 23_ 22. I’m in the eighth grade. After school_ I fold and then deliver the Seattle Times on Whidbey Island_ the second largest island in the continental United States as our teachers like to remind us. I am counting days until I fly from Seattle to Honolulu to meet my dad_ Commander Peter Rodrick_ and ride back to San Diego with him on the USS Kitty Hawk.   The voyage will take six days_ longer than I’ve ever spent alone with him. Finally_ there will be time. I can come clean about faking sick so I could watch the Red Sox-Yankees one-game playoff last October. The Sox are Dad’s team. He’ll understand. Finally_ I can learn what my father does. I know he flies jets off carriers_ but how? Finally_ I can ask him why things seem so hard all the time.   He is counting days_ too_ his letters to mom always mark the days left of his six-month deployment as skipper of VAQ-135_ The Black Ravens. He asks her to hold on a little longer_ she’s taking care of me and my two sisters alone and I can be a pain in the ass. (“I know Steve is probably getting excited and driving you crazy but 10 December will be here soon and you’ll have some peace and quiet.”)   I’m a nerd who can’t hit a baseball_ but I can tell you the Electoral College breakdown of the 1976 Carter-Ford election. I read the paper closely as I fold and rubber band them into my carrier bag. I begin to see photographs on the front page of American hostages in Tehran_ blindfolded and terrified. But I don’t connect all the dots. At school_ I spend my newspaper money on five ice cream sandwiches for lunch and taunt David Tapia about how I’m heading to Hawaii and he’s not. I turn thirteen and receive a note from Dad: “Happy 13th_ Welcome To Being A Teenager — Yuck!”    The Kitty Hawk is just running out the clock. The carrier is in Subic Bay in the Philippines where ordinance is loaded off and empty ammunition stores are filled with recently purchased stereo equipment_ wooden plates for the wives_ and black-market Adidas bags for the kids. Dad writes a letter on the back of a Naval Air Station Cubi Point menu — “I’m broke–” giving Mom advice about welcome home parties for the squadron.   And then_ it all changes. I’m cuddled up in bed with some purloined Chip Ahoy cookies_ listening to Larry King’s overnight radio show when Mom walks into my room. She is crying.   “Dad needs to talk to you.”   I’m half asleep and he is shouting through a bad connection from the Officers Club bar at Cubi Point. All I get out of the conversation is the trip is off. He won’t be home any time soon. On The Kitty Hawk_ the stereo equipment is thrown overboard and the bombs are reloaded.   I read more the next day. President Jimmy Carter has ordered the Kitty Hawk to head for the Straits of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. The Midway is already there. Carter and the Joint Chiefs believe that two carriers camped off the Iranian coast might persuade Ayatollah Khomeini to let the hostages go or at least convince him there will be a stiff price to pay if they come to harm.   Things go back to a dreary level of normal. A week passes and we spend Thanksgiving with other families at the Navy mess on base. On November 28_ my classmates and I take a short bus ride to the Roller Barn where the other kids make fun of me for not being able to skate backwards. And then my teacher taps me on the shoulder and points toward the lobby. There_ my dad’s best friend sits in his dress uniform. He pats me on the knee.“Your dad has been in an accident.”   I return home and there is a black sedan outside our house. A few hours later_ we get the official news: My father and three fellow aviators have been killed when their EA-6B Prowler crashes into the Indian Ocean near Diego Garcia on a low-level training mission meant to simulate an attack on Tehran.   Dad is 36.    And I blame it all on Jimmy Carter.   I KNOW IT isn’t rational_ but I base it on some facts. Not only did Carter send my father into harm’s way_ but on October 29_ 1979_ he allowed the despotic and deposed Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment. That is the immediate cause for Iranian students_ at Khomeini’s behest_ to storm the embassy and take the hostages a week later.   And I know my dad and his fellow pilots didn’t like the man_ even though he went to the Naval Academy just like many of them. I remember them sitting around our house the summer before drinking Coors and declaring his presidency a disaster. They see Carter as something of a joke and cringe when he delivers a speech saying a malaise and a crisis of confidence has spread across the country they were sworn to defend. Carter is the first Democratic president after the Vietnam debacle and they see the Georgian_ a former submarine officer_ as weak_ not willing to defend America’s interests overseas with force. (The irony that it was the previously unseen military muscle of Carter and his hawkish Middle East policy that led to my father’s death won’t hit me until much later.)   I wish I could say the feeling passes after a mourning period_ but it does not. I dance around like a mad man in an end zone celebration when Carter loses to Ronald Reagan the next year. By then_ we have moved to Flint_ Michigan_ to be closer to family. I attend Catholic high school_ because that’s what Dad would have wanted. At school_ I form with another kid_ whose estranged father happens to also be a Navy pilot_ the Conservative Liberation Organization_ a cringy ad hoc of weirdo kids — Stephen Miller definitely would have joined — intent on stamping out the Democratic Party and its commie liberal policies. I am the one kid in class who will write a full defense of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative for the school paper. Occasionally_ Carter appears on our television. I curse and ball my fists together in rage.   The phase does not pass quickly. I go away to college and mock students who are protesting student aid cuts as Reagan jacks up the military budget. I sneer and shout at them_ “We all have to make sacrifices for our country.”   I go into therapy and_ sure_ it’s a lot about Mom and the loss of my dad_ but Carter comes up a lot. He is the one who ruined my life_ he is the one who caused Mom to be left alone and broken. The therapist tries to reason with me_ but I do not hear.   Then something happens_ not connected to my father or Carter. I move to Chicago and I see the poverty in the rows and rows of high-rise public housing tenements lining the South Side. And I remember thinking that my father would have wept at all of this urban despair. And I remember that_ yes_ he was a hot-shot Navy pilot_ but he also was a man of God who went to Mass every day. After his crash_ the priest on the Kitty Hawk writes to my mother to say that somehow_ despite his 100-hour weeks doing the job he worked all his life to attain_ he also found time to counsel sailors in crisis on the ship.   My heart begins to unfreeze.    Somewhere_ I catch a TV news story of Carter building a house for the less fortunate with his wife_ Rosalynn. And I see in their relationship a reflection of my parents’ marriage_ a love that could survive crisis_ separation_ and even death. I learn that Carter is devout_ a Baptist like my mother_ and teaches Sunday School_ something my father wanted to do once he left the Navy. And then I talk with my mother. “I don’t blame Carter_” she tells me. “Your dad knew the risks; he knew this could happen. He wouldn’t want you to hate him.”   I AM A REPORTER and it is not impossible that my paths could crossed with Carter at some point. In fact_ I write a book about my father and Navy pilots and initially want to talk with Carter about the burden of sending Americans into harm’s way. Eventually_ I embed with my father’s old squadron and deploy with them. I even get up in a Prowler_ my dad’s old plane_ and fly over Whidbey and look down on my old paper route. My son is born on November 28_ 2013_ 34 years to the day after my dad’s crash. I name him after his grandfather. But I never reach out to Carter.    Why? I think I knew I would have broken down in the kind old man’s arms. I would have said I was sorry for hating him. And that I forgave him for simply fulfilling the hardest part of a president’s job. And I know he would have said he understood. Maybe he would have shed a tear of his own. But I never did it. I guess I am doing it now. President Carter_ rest in peace.

279512608,Penn State faces Notre in the Orange Bowl in the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs on Thursday_ Jan. 9_ 2024 (1/9/25) at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami_ Florida.  How to watch: Fans can watch the game for free via a trial of DirecTV Stream or fuboTV. You can also watch via a subscription to Sling TV_ which is offering half off your first month.  Here’s what you need to know:  What: Orange Bowl  Who: Penn State vs. Notre Dame  When: Thursday_ Jan. 9_ 2025  Where: Hard Rock Stadium (Miami_ Florida)  Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Live stream: DirecTV Stream or fuboTV  DANIA BEACH_ Fla. (AP) — It’s been a long time since either Notre Dame or Penn State reached college football’s mountaintop as national champions. It was 1988 for the Fighting Irish_ 1986 for the Nittany Lions. There’s been good seasons and bad seasons in the three-plus decades that have followed_ coaching changes and a complete overhaul of what the sport looks like.  Yet here they are — back again_ on the doorstep of a title shot.  The loss to Northern Illinois is no longer relevant to Notre Dame. The losses to Ohio State and Oregon don’t matter to Penn State right now. The Irish (13-1) and Nittany Lions (13-2) face off in the Orange Bowl on Thursday night_ the first of two College Football Playoff semifinal games; the other is Friday when Texas takes on Ohio State.  “Obviously_ you don’t get to this point in the season without being good in all three phases_” Penn State coach James Franklin said. “So far_ got a ton of respect for what we’ve seen on film and what we’ve studied_ and we’ve got a lot of work to do.”  Notre Dame has won 12 straight games_ its longest streak since a 16-game run spanning the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Its lone loss was a Week 2 defeat at home_ 16-14 to Northern Illinois. In the old days of college football — maybe as recently as last year_ even — such a loss could have doomed playoff chances. Not anymore.  Notre Dame got here by topping Georgia in the CFP quarterfinals at the Sugar Bowl_ a game that was delayed one day because of the truck attack in New Orleans. Penn State got its semifinal slot by topping Boise State at the Fiesta Bowl two days earlier.  “The mental preparation time has been the same_” Irish coach Marcus Freeman said. “For us_ it was just a normal week. It was a Saturday to a Saturday_ as we look at it in terms of game week. I think the coaches_ we probably were a little bit behind to start just because of the travel and in that aspect_ but physically our guys were good. Our guys were good_ and we’re going to be ready to roll.”  A historic matchup for Black coaches  It has been a storyline since the matchup was set: The winning coach in this game will go to the CFP title game on Jan. 20 with a chance of becoming the first Black coach to win a major college football national championship.  “I don’t take it lightly_” Franklin said.  Freeman made sure to give credit to the two people who hired him at Notre Dame: then-athletic director Jack Swarbrick and then-university president the Rev. John Jenkins.  “I want to make sure I recognize them_” Freeman said. “And again_ this isn’t about me. This isn’t about one person. It takes a team. It takes a program. It takes a lot of people committing to something bigger than themselves to put your team in a position to be here_ and I understand it_ and I’m very grateful for it. If this creates more opportunities for other coaches_ other minority coaches_ great. It’s great. It is great for the future generations of coaches_ of college football coaches_ of leaders. I am all for it_ and I’m grateful to be a part of that.”  It’s the 20th meeting between the programs. They split the first 19_ going 9-9-1_ and haven’t met since Sept. 8_ 2007.  The schools met annually from 1981 through 1992 when both were independents; Penn State joined the Big Ten starting with the 1993 season. Thursday’s game will be just the third meeting since.  Defense reigns  All four of the CFP semifinalists have stout defenses.  Ohio State ranks No. 1 nationally in yards allowed per game this season_ Texas is No. 3_ Penn State is No. 6 and Notre Dame is No. 8.  Notre Dame in NFL stadiums  Here’s good news for Notre Dame: It has won its last six games played in NFL stadiums. Hard Rock Stadium_ the site of the Orange Bowl_ is home to the Miami Dolphins.  Here’s bad news for Notre Dame: Hard Rock has not been fun for the Irish. They’re 0-2 in that stadium_ losing 42-14 to Alabama in the BCS championship game that capped the 2012 season and losing 41-8 to the Miami Hurricanes in 2017.  An intimate gathering  Attendance will be about 65_000 on Thursday night. For Penn State_ that’s a small crowd.  Bolstered by having a home stadium that routinely draws crowds exceeding 100_000_ the Nittany Lions will see their total attendance for the season approach the 1.4 million mark at the Orange Bowl.  It will extend Penn State’s single-season program record. The Nittany Lions drew 1_247_707 in 2002.  Thank you for supporting journalism you can trust.

279570014,ALBANY_ N.Y. — New York’s highest court declined to block Donald Trump’s upcoming sentencing in his hush money case Thursday_ leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as the president-elect’s likely last option to prevent the hearing from taking place Friday.  One judge of the New York Court of Appeals issued a brief order declining to grant a hearing to Trump’s legal team.  Trump has asked the Supreme Court to call off Friday’s sentencing in the hush money case.   His lawyers turned to the nation’s highest court on Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Judge Juan M. Merchan_ who presided over Trump’s trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.   Trump has denied wrongdoing.

Google has donated to inaugurals in the past_ and the YouTube livestream and link to the inauguration on Google’s homepage are in line with previous inaugurations_ a spokesperson said.  Trump has had a rocky relationship with major tech companies over the years_ and he has not shied away from criticism of the sector following the election. He signaled late last year that he wouldn’t rule out antitrust enforcement_ which is a particularly sore spot for Google.  A federal U.S. judge ruled in August that the company has illegally held a monopoly in search and text advertising. Arguments in a second antitrust case about Google’s advertising business closed in November_ though a verdict has not yet been announced.  “Big Tech has run wild for years_ stifling competition in our most innovative sector and_ as we all know_ using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans_ as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump wrote in a Dec. 4 post on Truth Social.   Google CEO Sundar Pichai and former Alphabet President Sergey Brin met with Trump after the election_ and Pichai publicly congratulated the president-elect on his “decisive victory” in a post on X.  — CNBC’s Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report

279752536,The reasons to ban TikTok are plentiful_ which is why overwhelming bipartisan majorities passed legislation last year to force owner ByteDance’s divestiture from the app or face a ban in the U.S. by Jan. 19. There are obvious national security risks to keeping TikTok around_ which are outlined in a recent Advancing American Freedom amicus brief urging the court to uphold the ban. But perhaps even more sinister are TikTok’s harmful effects on children’s well-being.  For as long as it has existed_ Chinese-controlled TikTok has insidiously exposed children and teenagers to the very worst sort of material: online content promoting suicide_ extreme diets_ distorted body images_ and corrupt ideologies. A 2022 Center for Countering Digital Hate study found that TikTok accounts registered as 13-year-olds witnessed suicidal content within mere minutes of setting up their accounts. The CCDH report also found that TikTok recommended videos about body image and mental health every 39 seconds_ using ads for medical procedures and weight-loss drinks as a means to undermine teens’ perception of their self-worth and body image. In total_ research by Eko found that suicide-related content on TikTok has generated over 1.43 million posts and 8.8 billion views since the app’s launch.  The real-life consequences of TikTok must not be taken lightly. Teens_ including 14-year-old Andie Duke_ who developed an eating disorder from exposure to TikTok’s harmful dieting video reels_ are being done a massive disservice by the platform’s recommendation loop. Duke noticed that “the more [she] interacted with those types of videos_ the more they started to show up.” She spent hours watching videos focused on calorie counting_ excessive exercise_ curbing hunger_ and ways to hide what she was doing from parents. Likewise_ TikTok user Daisy Gonzalez lost nearly 100 pounds in one year due to seeing so much dieting content on the platform_ causing her to develop gallstones and have her gallbladder removed.   The physical and mental anguish inflicted by TikTok extends far beyond dieting and suicide by telling children that they should question their biological sex and take steps to change it_ surgically and hormonally. The app aggressively pushes gender and sexuality content to minors_ even giving transgender influencers the ability to distribute puberty blockers and hormones to youth_ all without parental consent. Some users even say TikTok’s algorithm identified their bisexuality before they did.   One such victim of TikTok’s push for gender confusion who has since detransitioned_ Oli London_ has spoken out about the inner turmoil he experienced after engaging with the app. He explains that the app heavily promotes double mastectomies to women and girls using the hashtag #topsurgery_ which gained more than 2.1 billion views in 2023.  Parents should be terrified by just how pervasive TikTok’s influence is over the inner lives of their children and throughout our culture. In fact_ TikTok is the most popular social media platform among children in the United States and globally. Tragically_ 41% of American children spent more than two hours a day on the app in 2023_ allowing TikTok to acquire $2 billion in ad revenue from its users aged 13 to 17.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  The good news is that parents and policymakers are waking up to these horrifying realities. In April 2024_ 352 House members and 79 senators voted to block the Chinese-owned app from warping the minds and souls of our youth with destructive content. We all must continue to ensure that our lawmakers reinforce the timeless truth that children are best protected by those who love them most: parents and guardians.   China is attempting to harm the mental and physical health of American youth through TikTok’s dangerous algorithm. If TikTok is to continue to be available in app stores in the United States_ it must be sold to a U.S. company free from toxic Chinese propaganda or else banned from use. The health and safety of our posterity depend on it.  Paul Teller is the executive vice president of Advancing American Freedom.

279678866,Washington — A federal appeals court in Atlanta on Thursday rejected a bid to block the release of a portion of special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigation and prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump stemming from an alleged plan to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied the request from Walt Nauta_ an aide to Trump_ and Carlos de Oliveira_ the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago_ who were charged for their role in allegedly obstructing a separate federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records. The 11th Circuit granted Smith's request to drop Trump from the case in late November after he was elected to a second term in the White House because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But federal prosecutors are moving forward with the appeal of a lower court decision dismissing the charges against Nauta and de Oliveira on the grounds Smith was unconstitutionally appointed.Smith submitted a two-volume final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday evening that detailed his investigations into Trump. The first volume relates to the prosecution stemming from the 2020 election_ and the second volume pertains to the president-elect's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office in 2020.Garland has pledged to disclose to the public all special counsel reports completed while he was attorney general_ and has so far followed through on that pledge_ including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified.But lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira earlier this week sought to stop Smith's report from being made public_ arguing it would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon_ who oversaw the documents case_ to block the Justice Department from releasing the report. Separately_ the president-elect's lawyers urged Garland in a letter to remove Smith from his post as special counsel and stop the preparation and dissemination of his report.Cannon on Tuesday agreed to temporarily block the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolves the matter_ leaving it to the appeals court to decide whether Smith's work should be made public. Her order remains in effect for another three days_ though the appeals court said if the Justice Department would like to seek relief_ it could file a notice of appeal.In filings with the 11th Circuit_ the Justice Department asked the court to deny Nauta and de Oliveira's bid to keep the report shielded from the public_ but said Garland would not release the portion that deals with the classified documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing.Prosecutors said the attorney general does plan to disclose to Congress and the American people the first volume of Smith's report involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume about the documents case available for review only by the top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees_ and only if they agreed not to share information from it."This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests_" prosecutors wrote.Garland on Wednesday informed the top Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committees that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume "in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter_" but would not release the second volume "to avoid any risk of prejudice" to Nauta and de Oliveira.In their own filing with the 11th Circuit_ defense lawyers urged the court to send the dispute back to Cannon's court for a hearing and_ in the meantime_ prevent Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report."A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial_" they wrote.Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit_ his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to block the release of Smith's report.The report_ they claimed_ is "nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power."
279727246,By MICHAEL R. SISAK_ JENNIFER PELTZ and JAKE OFFENHARTZ_ Associated Press  NEW YORK (AP) — In a singular moment in U.S. history_ President-elect Donald Trump faces sentencing Friday for his New York hush money conviction after the nation’s highest court refused to intervene.  Like so much else in the criminal case and the current American political landscape_ the scenario set to unfold in an austere Manhattan courtroom was unimaginable only a few years ago. A state judge is to say what consequences_ if any_ the country’s former and soon-to-be leader will face for felonies that a jury found he committed.  With Trump 10 days from inauguration_ Judge Juan M. Merchan has indicated he plans a no-penalty sentence called an unconditional discharge and prosecutors aren’t opposing it. That would mean no jail time_ no probation and no fines would be imposed_ but nothing is final until Friday’s proceeding is done.  Regardless of the outcome_ Trump will become the first person convicted of a felony to assume the presidency.  Trump_ who is expected to appear by video from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida_ will have the opportunity to speak. He has pilloried the case_ the only one of his four criminal indictments that has gone to trial and possibly the only one that ever will.  The judge has indicated that he plans the unconditional discharge — a rarity in felony convictions — partly to avoid complicated constitutional issues that would arise if he imposed a penalty that overlapped with Trump’s presidency.  The hush money case accused him of fudging his business’ records to veil a $130_000 payoff to porn actor Stormy Daniels. She was paid_ late in Trump’s 2016 campaign_ not to tell the public about a sexual encounter she maintains the two had a decade earlier. He says nothing sexual happened between them_ and he contends that his political adversaries spun up a bogus prosecution to try to damage him.  “I never falsified business records. It is a fake_ made up charge_” the Republican president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform last week. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg_ whose office brought the charges_ is a Democrat.  Bragg’s office said in a court filing Monday that Trump committed “serious offenses that caused extensive harm to the sanctity of the electoral process and to the integrity of New York’s financial marketplace.”  While the specific charges were about checks and ledgers_ the underlying accusations were seamy and deeply entangled with Trump’s political rise. Prosecutors said Daniels was paid off — through Trump’s personal attorney at the time_ Michael Cohen — as part of a wider effort to keep voters from hearing about Trump’s alleged extramarital escapades.  Trump denies the alleged encounters occurred. His lawyers said he wanted to squelch the stories to protect his family_ not his campaign. And while prosecutors said Cohen’s reimbursements for paying Daniels were deceptively logged as legal expenses_ Trump says that’s simply what they were.  “There was nothing else it could have been called_” he wrote on Truth Social last week_ adding_ “I was hiding nothing.”  Trump’s lawyers tried unsuccessfully to forestall a trial. Since his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records_ they have pulled virtually every legal lever within reach to try to get the conviction overturned_ the case dismissed or at least the sentencing postponed.  They have made various arguments to Merchan_ New York appeals judges_ and federal courts including the Supreme Court. The Trump attorneys have leaned heavily into assertions of presidential immunity from prosecution_ and they got a boost in July from a Supreme Court decision that affords former commanders-in-chief considerable immunity.  Trump was a private citizen and presidential candidate when Daniels was paid in 2016. He was president when the reimbursements to Cohen were made and recorded the following year.  On one hand_ Trump’s defense argued that immunity should have kept jurors from hearing some evidence_ such as testimony about some of his conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks.  And after Trump won this past November’s election_ his lawyers argued that the case had to be scrapped to avoid impinging on his upcoming presidency and his transition to the Oval Office.  Merchan_ a Democrat_ repeatedly postponed the sentencing_ initially set for July. But last week_ he set Friday’s date_ citing a need for “finality.” He wrote that he strove to balance Trump’s need to govern_ the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling_ the respect due a jury verdict and the public’s expectation that “no one is above the law.”  Trump’s lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to block the sentencing. Their last hope vanished Thursday night with a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that declined to delay the sentencing.  Meanwhile_ the other criminal cases that once loomed over Trump have ended or stalled ahead of trial.  After Trump’s election_ special counsel Jack Smith closed out the federal prosecutions over Trump’s handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. A state-level Georgia election interference case is locked in uncertainty after prosecutorFaniWillis was removed from it.

279926254,KYIV_ Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s forces have captured two North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian troops in Russia’s Kursk border region_ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday.   He made the comments days after Ukraine began pressing new attacks in Kursk to retain ground captured in a lightning incursion in August that resulted in the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II.   Moscow’s counterattack has left Ukrainian forces outstretched and demoralized_ killing and wounding thousands and retaking more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk Ukraine had seized.  “Our soldiers have captured North Korean soldiers in Kursk. These are two soldiers who_ although wounded_ survived_ were taken to Kyiv_ and are communicating” with Ukrainian security services_ Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.  He shared photos of two men resting on cots in a room with bars over the windows. Both wore bandages_ one around his jaw and the other around both hands and wrists.   Zelenskyy said capturing the soldiers alive was “not easy.” He asserted that Russian and North Korean forces fighting in Kursk have tried to conceal the presence of North Korean soldiers_ including by killing wounded comrades on the battlefield to avoid their capture and interrogation by Kyiv.  Ukraine’s security service SBU on Saturday provided more information on the two soldiers. In a statement_ it said one had no documents at all_ while the other had been carrying a Russian military ID card in the name of a man from Tuva_ a Russian region bordering Mongolia.   “The prisoners do not speak Ukrainian_ English or Russian_ so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence_” the statement said.   According to the SBU_ one of the soldiers claimed he had been told he was going to Russia for training_ rather than to fight against Ukraine.   The agency said both men were provided with medical care in line with the Geneva Conventions_ and are being investigated “in cooperation with South Korean intelligence.”  A senior Ukrainian military official said last month that a couple hundred North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk have been killed or wounded in battle.  The official was providing the first significant estimate of North Korean casualties_ which came several weeks after Ukraine announced that Pyongyang had sent 10_000 to 12_000 troops to Russia to help it in its almost 3-year war against its much smaller neighbor.  The White House and Pentagon last month confirmed that the North Korean forces have been battling on the front lines in largely infantry positions. They have been fighting with Russian units and_ in some cases_ independently around Kursk.  Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine
279874178,Sam Moore_ one-half of the Sam & Dave duo_ died on Friday_ Jan. 10. He was 89.   The celebrated R&B singer died after surgery in Coral Gables_ Fla._ his wife and longtime manager_ Joyce Moor_ confirmed to The New York Times.   Moore was born in Miami on Oct. 12_ 1935. He started professional singing in the late 1950s when he met his future partner_ Dave Prater. By 1961_ they met again at the King of Hearts club in Miami and soon began performing together as a music group. By 1964_ Atlantic Records watched the two perform and then offered them a contract.   Throughout the 1960s_ they hit their stride_ and the pair released R&B hits_ including “Hold On_ I’m Comin_’ ” “I Thank You_” and “Soul Man.” The latter topped the charts and hit No. 2 on the pop charts in 1967. The track also won a Grammy for best rhythm & blues group performance_ vocal or instrumental.   The two split in 1970 and Moore recorded a solo album_ Plenty Good Lovin’_ which was released in 2002.   Throughout their careers_ they would break up and reunite several times when their solo careers did not reach the success they wanted.   "It was a duo_” Moore said in the 1998 book Sam and Dave: An Oral History. “But it wasn’t a partnership.”   The pair performed together for the final time on New Year’s Eve 1981 in San Francisco_ and once they left the stage_ they never spoke again_ per The New York Times. Around the same time_ they both struggled with a heroin addiction. After meeting Joyce McRae_ she eventually became his manager and urged him to participate in trials for anti-opiate treatments. By 1983_ he went public with his addiction and volunteered with people struggling with the same issue.   During his solo career_ Moore toured with several performers_ including Bruce Springsteen. Meanwhile_ Prater recruited a new partner_ Sam Daniels_ and they worked together and called themselves Sam & Dave_ despite Moore’s objections. The original duo were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Six years later_ Prater died in a fatal car accident.   In 2019_ the duo received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2019.   Moore is survived by his wife_ Joyce_ their daughter Michelle_ and grandchildren Tash_ and Misha.
279862184,Sam Moore_ who helped bring the sound of the church to pop music with a string of call-and-response hits as the high tenor in the Stax Records duo Sam & Dave with partner Dave Prater_ has died. He was 89.   Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables_ Florida_ of complications recovering from surgery_ his rep Jeremy Westby announced.   Called “the greatest of all soul duos” by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame_ which inducted the pair in 1992_ Sam & Dave worked with the songwriting/production team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter_ using Booker T & the M.G.’s and the Memphis Horns as their backing band_ to produce a string of indelible rave-up hits from 1965-68.   The combination of talent produced such fevered back-and-forth exchanges as “You Don’t Know Like I Know_” “Hold On_ I’m Coming_” “You Got Me Hummin’_” “Soul Man” and “I Thank You.”   Along with labelmate Otis Redding_ Sam & Dave were show-stopping live performers_ electrifying the Stax revues of the mid-1960s and fueling Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi to create their own Ray Ban-wearing homage as The Blues Brothers.   Born on Oct. 12_ 1935_ in Miami — where he first met his soon-to-be-sidekick in 1961 — Samuel David Moore was a church-reared singer who performed with such gospel quarters as The Gales and The Millionaires and once reportedly turned down an offer to replace a departing Sam Cooke in The Soul Stirrers. Moore and Prater_ who was also an experienced gospel singer_ crossed paths at Miami’s The King of Hearts club_ where they were discovered by producer Henry Stone_ who signed them to Roulette Records.    Experiencing only minor success at Roulette_ the duo’s career began to take off after they were signed by Atlantic Records’ Jerry Wexler in 1964_ then “loaned” out to Stax to produce_ record and release their records.   The pair’s November 1965 single_ “You Don’t Know Like I Know_” launched a series of 10 straight Top 20 Billboard R&B classics_ including “Hold On_ I’m Coming” (’66)_ “You Got Me Hummin’” (’66)_ “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby” (’67)_ “Soul Man” (’67) and “I Thank You” (’68)_ a majority of them written by Hayes and Porter.   The two_ who were often at odds_ broke up in 1970 with the end of their relationship with Stax. Sam & Dave’s off-and-on relationship continued until 1981_ enjoying a resurgence in popularity with The Blues Brothers’ cover of “Soul Man” in 1979. The pair’s last performance together was New Year’s Eve 1981 at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. Prater died in a car crash on April 9_ 1988.   Moore launched his own solo career after breaking up with Prater the first time in 1970_ recording several singles for an album with Atlantic that weren’t released for more than 30 years after the murder of the record’s producer_ King Curtis.   Moore toured with other soul artists_ including Wilson Pickett in spring 1982 in Europe_ where he married Joyce McRae_ who helped him overcome a lengthy drug addiction. Moore not only went public with his addiction in 1983_ he became a strong anti-drug advocate and worked as a volunteer for various anti-drug programs. His wife remained his business manager until his death_ working with him to advocate artist’s rights_ royalties and pension payments.   Moore found his opportunities as a solo performer apart from Prater waning_ and at one point was forced to sue Prater to prevent him from touring as Sam & Dave with another singer_ Sam Daniels. Moore eventually formed an organization_ Artists and Others Against Imposters_ to prevent groups from deceiving the public by going out without their original members_ testifying before Congress in 1989.   Moore performed on Don Henley’s Building the Perfect Beast album in 1984 on the song “You’re Not Drinking Enough” and two years later rerecorded “Soul Man” with Lou Reed for the film of the same name_ reaching No. 30 on the U.K. singles chart. In 1988_ he joined the Elwood Blues Revue_ featuring Dan Aykroyd and The Blues Brothers band.   Moore appeared in Monkee Michael Nesmith’s 1988 film spoof_ Tapeheads_ with Junior Walker as the “legendary” soul duo_ The Swanky Modes. They later performed “Ordinary Ma_ from the movie together on Late Night With David Letterman. The pairing represented a rare joining of artists from both the Stax and Motown labels.

The Buckeyes (13-2) got the semifinal victory in the same stadium where 10 years ago they were champions in the debut of the College Football Playoff as a four-team format. Now they have the opportunity to be the winner again in the debut of the expanded 12-team field. Ohio State plays Orange Bowl champion Notre Dame in Atlanta on Jan. 20 Sawyer got to Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers on a fourth-and-goal from the 8_ knocking the ball loose and scooping it up before lumbering all the way to the other end. It was the longest fumble return in CFP history. Ewers and Sawyer were roommates in Columbus for the one semester the quarterback was there before transferring home to Texas_ and helping lead the Longhorns (13-3) to consecutive CFP semifinals. But next season will be their 20th since winning their last national title with Vince Young in 2005.

Watch the NFL Playoffs on FuboTV (7-day free trial) and Paramount+  #5 Los Angeles Chargers vs. #4 Houston Texans  When: Saturday_ January 11Time: 4:30 p.m. ETWhere: NRG Stadium (Houston_ Texas)Channel: CBSStream: FuboTV (Free Trial)_ DirecTV Stream_ Sling_ Paramount+  Both teams are coming into the postseason on various swings of momentum.  The Texans clinched the AFC South title almost by default. Thanks to lackluster division that saw only Houston finish with a winning record_ the Texans were able to at least secure the four seed in the AFC with a 10-7 record. The team looked impressive early on this year_ but a couple of tough losses left fans to wonder how far this team can go. Disappointing defeats at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens placed some doubts around the team_ despite beating the Tennessee Titans in the final game of the regular season.  Houston made it to the divisional round last year before losing to the Ravens.  The Chargers are back in the playoffs after missing out last year. Under Jim Harbaugh_ confidence on both sides of the ball was noticeable throughout the season. After a bumpy start_ L.A. started to pick up wins and play some impressive games. Even though they lost to the likes of the Ravens and Chiefs_ they showed they can hang with the best teams in the NFL_ finishing second in the AFC West with an 11-6 record.  The Chargers are trying to win their first playoff game in five years.  L.A. is 6-3 in nine meetings with Houston.  MY PICK: Chargers win_ 24-20  Watch the NFL Playoffs on FuboTV (7-day free trial)

Blue and Purple defeated me. Games are a blindspot for me. If I enjoy a game I get locked into it for years – Tetris_ Sim City_ Balatro – playing absolutely nothing else until a new game takes over_ or as was the case with a dinner party game called RSVP I played every day on my phone_ accidentally delete and then find out it is no no longer available. I realize this is a bit odd and it’s left me completely ignorant of everything else. But even if I was aware of the video game canon of the late 20th century I would have definitely included SONIC THE HEDGEHOG as an Atari game (it’s Sega)_ instead of the THINGS FEATURING TAILS category.  After Googling “does Sonic The Hedgehog have a tail?” (I’m not the first to do this) I eventually discovered that Tails is the name of a character within the Sonic The Hedgehog universe – and yes Sonic does have a tail.

279983234,South Korea's National Intelligence Service on Sunday backed up Ukraine's account of having captured two wounded North Korean soldiers this week in Russia_ after Kyiv said they were being questioned.Ukraine_ the United States and South Korea have accused nuclear-armed North Korea of sending more than 10_000 soldiers to help bolster Russian forces.Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said in a statement it has "confirmed that the Ukrainian military captured two North Korean soldiers on January 9 in the Kursk battlefield in Russia".On Saturday_ Ukrainian intelligence (SBU) released a video showing the two men in hospital bunks_ one with bandaged hands and the other with a bandaged jaw. A doctor at the detention centre said the first man also had a broken leg.The SBU said the men had told interrogators they were experienced army soldiers_ and one said he was sent to Russia for training_ not fighting.But Kyiv did not present direct evidence that the captured men were North Korean and AFP was unable to independently verify their nationalities.South Korea's confirmation added weight to Kyiv's account.The NIS similarly said one of the captured soldiers revealed during his interrogation that he received military training from Russian forces after arriving there in November."He initially believed he was being sent for training_ realising upon arrival in Russia that he had been deployed_" the NIS said.The soldier said North Korean forces had experienced "significant losses during battle".According to Seoul's intelligence agency_ one of the men "went without food or water for 4 to 5 days before being captured".The NIS said it would continue to work with the SBU to share information on North Korean fighters in Ukraine.Neither Russia nor North Korea has reacted to the intelligence accounts.Russia and North Korea have boosted their military ties since Moscow's invasion_ though neither has confirmed that Pyongyang's forces are fighting for Moscow.Zelensky said last month that nearly 3_000 North Korean soldiers had been "killed or wounded" there_ while Seoul put the figure at 1_000.The NIS told the country's lawmakers last month that "several North Korean casualties" had already been attributed to Ukrainian missile and drone attacks as well as training accidents_ with the highest ranking "at least at the level of a general". Due to losses among its forces_ North Korea is preparing for additional deployment to Ukraine_ according to Seoul's military. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement last month that Pyongyang is reportedly "preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers" to aid Russia's war effort.Pyongyang and Moscow have deepened political_ military and cultural ties since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022_ with Putin and Kim repeatedly professing their personal closeness.In a New Year's letter_ North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed Vladimir Putin and made a possible reference to the war in Ukraine.He said 2025 would be the year "when the Russian army and people defeat neo-Nazism and achieve a great victory".

279974050,Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump_ an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead.  The department disclosed Smith’s departure in a court filing Saturday_ saying he had resigned one day earlier. The resignation_ 10 days before Trump is inaugurated _ follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump’s White House win in November.  At issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.  The Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration_ but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump’s co-defendants in that case_ Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira_ had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial_ an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.  The department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July_ a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.  But prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume.  In an emergency motion late Friday_ they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report_ but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday.  The appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report_ which covers Trump’s efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6_ 2021_ to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon’s injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.  The Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon’s order was “plainly erroneous.”  “The Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department_” the Justice Department said. “The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.”  Justice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work_ and it’s customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject.  William Barr_ attorney general during Trump’s first term_ released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.  Biden’s attorney general_ Merrick Garland_ has also released special counsel reports_ including about Biden’s handling of classified information before Biden became president.

280053834,Jan. 13 (UPI) -- Blue Origin scrubbed the launch of its new heavy-lift rocket early Monday_ once again postponing the maiden flight of its New Glenn rocket.  The two-stage reusable New Glenn launch vehicle was scheduled to lift off from Launch Complex 36 at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window that opened at 1 a.m. EST Monday.  After the window opened_ the launch was repeatedly pushed until ultimately being scrubbed.  In a statement_ Blue Origin said it was standing down the NG-1 Mission to "troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue."  "We're reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt_" it said on X.  The launch was earlier scheduled for Friday but was pushed to Sunday due to unfavorable weather in the Atlantic where the first-stage booster -- named So You're Telling Me There's A Chance -- was to be retrieved by the Jacklyn droneship.  Persistent conditions in the Atlantic again saw the launch moved to Monday. Ahead of the rescheduled attempt_ Blue Origin made no announcement regarding weather but stated the launch team was proceeding with fueling New Glenn with propellant.  As the launch window opened_ Blue Origin published a statement to its X account_ stating NG-1 Mission's goal is for their rocket to reach orbit.  "Anything beyond that is icing on the cake_" it said.  "We know landing the booster on our first try offshore in the Atlantic is ambitious -- but we're going for it. No matter what happens_ we'll learn_ refine and apply that knowledge to our next launch."  The 320-foot New Glenn orbital-class rocket -- named after John Glenn_ the first American to orbit Earth -- is set to transport to space a payload of the Blue Ring Pathfinder_ which is designed to test communications_ power and controls systems for Blue Origin's multi-use Blue Ring space platform.  According to Blue Origin_ New Glenn's first-stage booster is designed for a minimum of 25 flights. With a nearly 23-foot class payload fairing_ New Glenn boasts twice the volume of SpaceX's Falcon 9 17-foot payload fairing option.  The highly-anticipated launch will mark a significant milestone for the Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin_ which was founded in 2000 and has been working on the New Glenn rocket for more than a decade.  A successful launch would help New Glenn achieve Department of Defense certification_ positioning Blue Origin to compete for private and government contracts with SpaceX_ owned by the world's richest person Elon Musk_ which has dominated the satellite launch service industry.  Bezos_ according to Forbes_ sits at second on the world's richest list.

280162038,TOKYO -- A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit southwestern Japan_ the country's Meteorological Agency said Monday.

280140052,In many ways_ I couldn’t be happier with Dynasty Warriors Origins. The revitalization of what had become a very tired franchise is mostly a successful one_ modernizing its gameplay elements while retaining what made it so special in the first place. You just can’t get that immense ‘1 vs. 1_000’ power fantasy anywhere else_ and Dynasty Warriors Origins does it better than ever.  Rest assured that for the most part_ this is still a Dynasty Warriors game through and through. You’ll rampage across massive battlefields_ taking out key positions and removing enemy officers from play to gain the advantage - often laying waste to thousands of soldiers unlucky enough to be on your path from A to B.  But the gameplay loop has evolved in so many ways. For one_ weapon types aren’t just different ways to hit the same normal / strong attack combos in sequence_ instead offering unique mechanics that set them apart from each other. New elements like grand tactics and ambush charges also add a wonderfully cinematic feeling to battles when they happen_ ensuring that something monumentally exciting happens on almost every map.  Then there’s the story_ which has also seen a pretty major shift_ and it’s one I have mixed feelings about. The move to a sole playable protagonist is a pretty bold change on developer Omega Force’s part_ and while other officers are playable (and extremely powerful) in a limited capacity_ this’ll probably be a letdown for long-time series fans hoping to get stuck in with a returning favorite.  Return to the Three Kingdoms  As ever_ Dynasty Warriors Origins’ narrative is based on that of Luo Guanzhong’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Three distinct factions are locked in a power struggle as each attempts to unify China under one banner as the influence of the Han dynasty begins to wane.  Origins’ story presents things a little differently. While still featuring the era’s major events such as the Yellow Turban Rebellion_ Dong Zhuo’s tyrannical reign_ and the pivotal Battle of Red Cliffs_ we do it all through the eyes of an original protagonist.  This approach comes with its own set of successes and drawbacks. You’re given a lot of agency in the officers you wish to get to know better via bonding events and optional battles_ especially later in the game where you need to decide on which of the three factions you’ll join. This_ in turn_ can change the latter half of Origins greatly_ with you fighting different battles and armies based on your choices. That naturally makes for a healthy amount of replay value as you can go back and explore other routes via New Game Plus.  On the other hand_ the shift to a single playable protagonist has plenty of faults. For one_ the hero is aggressively bland. He barely registers any kind of expression during cutscenes and has no voice lines of his own outside of flavor text in battle. Plus_ his story just isn’t very interesting with an amnesiac narrative that culminates in a pretty predictable payoff.  It just ultimately doesn’t add much value to the timeless and still very engaging Three Kingdoms plot. I do feel that having the option to create your own character - like in other Koei Tecmo games such as Nioh 2_ Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty_ and Rise of the Ronin - could’ve remedied this problem to a degree. At least then_ we’d be able to apply some kind of identity to our protagonist especially as you won’t have much opportunity to play as other iconic officers - but more on that later.  Army of one  So while Dynasty Warriors Origins’ narrative changes end up feeling a little flat for me_ I won’t be saying the same for its gameplay. Origins is the best-feeling Warriors game ever made_ even when accounting for some of the excellent spin-offs like Hyrule Warriors and Dragon Quest Heroes 2. Origins boasts a level of AAA quality that the series has simply never had before_ and it brings plenty of changes and additions that help keep the experience from feeling stale.  For starters_ each of the game’s nine weapon types all feel distinct and are a far cry from the usual normal-to-strong attack combos we typically get from the series. That style is retained on the basic sword weapon type_ but I found pretty much every other weapon to be vastly more interesting.  The twin pikes_ for example_ dish out more damaging blows when your strong attack inputs are hit at the right time. Meanwhile_ the lance lets you absorb blows by holding down the strong attack button leading to a devastating attack at full strength. A favorite of mine is the gauntlets which let you adopt various stances for a wide variety of different attacks suited to both crowd control and single-target damage.  Weapon types will also rank up the more you use them_ unlocking even more moves and abilities for each. Higher ranks will in turn unlock new sets of nodes on your skill tree_ further bolstering your power when you redeem skill points earned through battle and by ticking off optional training objectives assigned to you by other officers. Furthermore_ Bravery skills and Tactics offer an even wider pool of abilities_ including powerful guard-breaking attacks and volleys of arrows to reign down on the opposing army.  There may be fewer weapon types overall when compared to older Warriors entries_ then_ but this has allowed Omega Force to really flesh out their move sets for a more fulfilling experience overall. It’s great that the game incentivizes you to try out all weapon types_ too_ via those aforementioned training objectives and evolving move sets as they rank up.  It’s not just the protagonist that can be controlled during battle_ though. You also have the ability to partner up with another iconic officer as a companion. When their meter is full_ you’re able to temporarily switch to them. These officers_ including series favorites like Xiahou Dun_ Guan Yu_ and Sun Shangxiang_ are deliberately overpowered and are able to turn the tides of a battle in an instant.  Companion officers do feel superb to play as_ with their own abilities and Bravery arts to make use of. I am pretty mixed on the mechanic as a whole_ though_ as I definitely would’ve preferred an option to just play as them outright in addition to the protagonist. It probably won’t be such a huge deal if Origins is your first Warriors game_ but_ as a long-time fan_ I can’t help but miss being able to play as a wider variety of Three Kingdoms heroes freely.  A truly modern Musou  I think it’s fair to say that Dynasty Warriors Origins absolutely achieves what it sets out to do in revitalizing the Musou experience for a modern audience. It gave me that same “there is simply nothing else like this” feeling that I had with Dynasty Warriors 5 back in my teens. Nowhere is this more apparent than with Origins’ electrifying large-scale battles.  The general gameplay loop largely remains unchanged if you’re familiar with the Musou format. Most maps will have you eliminating enemy officers_ taking over key bases_ or escorting units to a particular location. With the power of current-generation gaming systems_ however_ Omega Force is finally able to make these battles feel truly large and cinematic.  That’s driven home by one major new feature: charges. When prompted to do so_ you can head to a location on the map where your army has gathered to initiate a forward charge. This_ for me_ is the high point of any battle_ as the camera pans back to give a wide view of the battlefield as you charge head-on towards the opposing army. A subtle screen shake and the courageous screams of your infantry further sell the moment as hundreds of troops clash into each other for an ultimate confrontation. It’s a moment that feels immensely rewarding and satisfying_ and again_ is unlike anything I’ve seen in any other action game_ let alone any other Warriors title.  This incredible presentation is backed up by some pretty impressive visuals and yes_ that trademark Dynasty Warriors brand of hard rock for the soundtrack. Perhaps most surprising of all_ though_ Origins is able to maintain a steady 60 frames per second (fps) in the default performance mode. There are also options for 30fps and 120fps modes_ but the trade-offs here are either choppier performance or too big of a loss in visual clarity_ respectively. The 60fps mode provides a pretty nice sweet spot and is the mode I would recommend for players without a high-end PC or PS5 Pro.  Should I play Dynasty Warriors Origins?  Play it if…  Don’t play it if…  Accessibility  Dynasty Warriors Origins has a handful of helpful accessibility options_ led by three ‘color perception’ settings aimed at colorblind players These are unhelpfully labeled as settings ‘1_ 2 and 3’ so you’ll need to switch between each to find which one best suits your needs. You can also adjust subtitle size_ and choose to have a boxed backdrop for subtitles for easier reading.  Beyond this_ there’s not much to speak of beyond the usual camera sensitivity and rumble adjustment settings. It is worth noting_ though_ that the three difficulty levels can be swapped between during the campaign itself_ so there’s no need to commit if things are getting too easy or too hard as you progress.  How I reviewed Dynasty Warriors Origins  I played Dynasty Warriors Origins for 30 hours on PS5_ taking me to the end of the main campaign. This playtime is expected to increase_ though_ as I head back into New Game Plus to try out other routes on the way to unlocking the game’s ‘true’ ending.  I played the game on a 4K LG CX OLED TV_ primarily using the DualSense Wireless Controller to experience Origins’ fairly light usage of its haptic feedback. I often paired this with a JBL Quantum 910P gaming headset for a rich audio experience.  First reviewed January 2025

280261460,January 6_ 2025 Smith’s Report Violates The Presumption of Innocence The presumption of innocence is “the undoubted law_ axiomatic and elementary.” Coffin v. United States_ 156 U.S. 432_ 453 (1895). It is “vital and fundamental” to our Constitutional system_ id. at 460_ and “its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law_” id. at 453; see also Cool v. United States_ 409 U.S. 100_ 104 (1972) (holding violation of defendant’s “constitutionally rooted presumption of innocence” required reversal). “The presumption serves as a reminder to the jury that the prosecution has the burden of proving every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt_” United States v. Starks_ 34 F.4th 1142_ 1158 (10th Cir. 2022)_ and thus_ may be “extinguished only upon the jury’s determination that guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt_” Mahorney v. Wallman_ 917 F.2d 469_ 471 n.2 (10th Cir. 1990) (emphasis in original) (collecting cases). Consistent with these bedrock principles_ the Justice Manual prohibits prosecutors from publicly declaring a defendant’s guilt prior to a jury verdict_ or otherwise disseminating statements inconsistent with the presumption of innocence. Justice Manual §§ 1.7.500; 1-7.600; 28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a) (“A Special Counsel shall comply with the rules_ regulations_ procedures_ practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”). Rather_ prosecutors must limit their statements to “[t]he substance of the charge_ as contained in the complaint_ indictment_ information_ or other public documents” and any “release issued before a finding of guilt should state that the charge is merely an accusation_ and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Justice Manual § 1.7.500. Moreover_ “DOJ personnel should refrain from disclosing” inter alia. “[a]ny opinion as to [a] defendant’s guilt” or any other “[o]bservations about a defendant’s or party’s character” “except as appropriate in the proceeding or in an announcement after a finding of guilt.” Justice Manual § 1-7.610 (emphasis added). These restrictions ensure that the Department’s statements do not “prejudice the rights of a defendant; or unfairly damage the reputation of a person.” Justice Manual § 1-7.100; see also 32 C.F.R. § 776.47 (“Except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the trial counsel’s actions and that serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose_ refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.”); D.C. Bar Rule 3.8 (same). The Draft Report violates every one of these core requirements. Despite Smith’s decision to dismiss his cases against President Trump_ and his complete failure to obtain a “jury’s determination that guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt_” Mahorney_ 917 F.2d at 471 n.2 (emphasis in original)_ his Draft Report repeatedly_ and falsely_ claims that President Trump_ Carlos De Oliveria_ Waltine Nauta_ and others have committed crimes and otherwise engaged in purported “criminal conduct.” For example_ Volume I of the Draft Report falsely asserts_ without any jury determination_ that President Trump and others “engaged in an unprecedented criminal effort_” was “the head of the criminal conspiracies_” and harbored a “criminal design.” Draft Report_ Vol. I at 2_ 68_ 69. These false accusations of criminality_ which Smith again utterly failed to prove in Court_ repeat throughout Volume I. See_ e.g._ id. at 3_ 52_ 60_ 64_ 67_ 88_ 108. Likewise_ Volume II asserts_ without any supporting verdict_ “that Mr. Trump violated multiple federal criminal laws_” and that he and others engaged in “criminal conduct.” Vol. II at 60_ 88; see also_ e.g._ id. at 89_ 121. Moreover_ the Draft Report makes these allegations despite Blanche Law PLLC 99 Wall Street_ Suite 4460 | New York_ NY 10005 (212) 716-1250 | www.BlancheLaw.com
280250450,Jessica Simpson and husband Eric Johnson are taking time apart.   The singer and actress_ 44_ and her former NFL player husband_ 45_ are separating after 10 years of marriage_ Simpson tells PEOPLE exclusively.   "Eric and I have been living separately navigating a painful situation in our marriage_" Simpson said in a statement to PEOPLE. "Our children come first_ and we are focusing on what is best for them. We are grateful for all of the love and support that has been coming our way_ and appreciate privacy right now as we work through this as a family."    The news comes less than one week after Simpson — who shares three children with Johnson — posted a sunny selfie to Instagram_ reminding her followers that "Life is short. SMILE while you still have teeth😜."   Johnson was spotted without his wedding ring in November_ around the same time Simpson teased her "comeback" to music with a cryptic Instagram post that featured photos of herself in a recording studio.   "Interviews in my Nashville music room where I unearthed my singular magic_" she captioned the images. "This comeback is personal. It’s an apology to myself for putting up with everything I did not deserve."   A source told PEOPLE days later that that the "With You" singer and her husband "very much live separate lives."   Simpson and Johnson married in July 2014 after four years of dating and share three children: daughters Maxwell "Maxi" Drew_ 12_ and Birdie Mae_ 5_ and son Ace Knute_ 11.   The pair first met through a mutual friend in 2010 and were engaged that November after six months of dating.   The Open Book author and the retired tight end welcomed their first two children_ Maxwell and Ace_ in May 2012 and June 2013_ respectively.   Their son and daughter appeared as the ring bearer and flower girl when the couple tied the knot before more than 250 guests in Montecito_ Calif.   "A true love will never make you question yourself or what's real_" she told PEOPLE in 2023. "Thanks to my amazing soulmate I am able to love passionately and without fear of being hurt."   That same year_ Simpson opened up to PEOPLE about how Johnson "embraces" her career.   "I don't find it hard to love anybody_ but I have always thought that I was hard to love_ that I was too much for people_ or my schedule was too demanding_" she shared. "He knows my heart and understands my heart more than anyone I've ever met in my life."   Simpson also said that their relationship has always felt "easy" and that they've always tried to "keep the romance there_ even with three kids."   For Johnson's birthday in September 2023_ she shared photos on Instagram from their family birthday celebration and paid tribute to him in a sweet caption.   "My heart is so taken with this Man_ I could hardly call it my own.... We love youuuu_" she wrote.   The pair also spent time sans kids in early 2023 by taking a couples getaway in March.

280242658,Village People have joined the presidential inaugural activities for Donald Trump.    The group took to Facebook on Monday (Jan. 13) to announce that they have “accepted an invitation from President Elect Trump’s campaign to participate in inaugural activities_ including at least one event with President Elect Trump.”   They continued_ “We know this wont make some of you happy to hear however we believe that music is to be performed without regard to politics. Our song Y.M.C.A. is a global anthem that hopefully helps bring the country together after a tumultuous and divided campaign where our preferred candidate lost.”   The statement concluded_ “Therefore_ we believe it’s now time to bring the country together with music which is why VILLAGE PEOPLE will be performing at various events as part of the 2025 Inauguration of Donald J. Trump.”   See the post here.   According to The Hill_ the group will perform at Trump’s “victory rally” at Capital One Arena in Washington_ and at the Liberty Inaugural Ball.   “Macho Man” and “Y.M.C.A.” were popular song choices at Trump campaign rallies during his 2020 and 2024 campaign rallies.   In December_ Village People’s Victor Willis doubled down on why he chose to let the president-elect play “Y.M.C.A.” at rallies and events_ saying he “didn’t have the heart” to block the usage — despite originally asking Trump to stop in 2020 — upon realizing that the politician seemed to “genuinely like” and was “having a lot of fun” with “Y.M.C.A.” Plus_ as Willis noted_ the dance tune has only “benefited greatly” in terms of chart placements and sales since the twice-impeached former POTUS incorporated it into his campaign.   Earlier in the day_ it was revealed that Carrie Underwood will be performing at the presidential inauguration ceremony on Monday_ Jan. 20_ at the U.S. Capitol in Washington_ D.C.. The eight-time Grammy winner will perform “America the Beautiful_” accompanied by The Armed Forces Chorus and the The United States Naval Academy Glee Club.   She shared to Billboard via a statement_ “I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event. I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”
280375966,Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Linkedin  President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he hopes to create a new federal entity in charge of collecting revenue from his proposed import taxes upon his inauguration_ signaling a further backing of Trump’s controversial tariffs_ though Trump would likely lack the authority to make an entirely new agency.  Trump declared next Monday will be the “birth date” of the IRS counterpart as tariffs become a core ... [+] storyline at the start of his second term. Getty Images  Trump wants to create an “External Revenue Service_” he said in a post to his Truth Social platform.  The proposed entity_ which would be a counterpart to the federal tax-focused Internal Revenue Service_ would “collect our Tariffs_ Duties_ and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources_” according to Trump_ nodding to the universal tariffs at the core of his economic platform.  Next Monday—the date of his inauguration—will be the “birth date” of the External Revenue Service_ Trump declared.  Can Trump Create The External Revenue Service As A Federal Agency?  It is Congress_ not the President_ which has the power to create federal agencies_ according to the Constitution_ complicating Trump’s goal to immediately create the External Revenue Service_ though Republicans hold a majority in the House and Senate.  The establishment of a new federal agency apparently moves against the objectives of Trump megadonor and $400 billion man Elon Musk. Musk_ the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency commission backed by Trump_ said in November he hopes to cut the number of federal agencies from over 400 to 99 or less_ a more than 75% reduction.  Key Background  The Customs and Border Protection_ a part of the Department of Homeland Security_ is in charge of collecting tariffs. Trump has supported tariffs of at least 10% on imported goods_ a policy designed to boost domestic manufacturing and as a foreign policy negotiation tool_ though economists warn tariffs may worsen inflation as companies pass on the taxes to customers.

280357018,Rashida Jones_ the president of MSNBC_ announced Tuesday that she is stepping down after four years of steering the cable news network. Jones_ who made history as the first Black executive to lead a major U.S. television news network_ made the announcement to top MSNBC anchors_ leaders and network staff on Tuesday morning. (MSNBC and NBC News are both units of NBCUniversal.) Rebecca Kutler_ the network's senior vice president of content strategy_ was named interim MSNBC president. Jones_ who recruited Kutler to the network in 2022_ plans to stay on in an advisory role until March. “I came to this decision over the holidays while reflecting on our remarkable journey and the many successes we’ve achieved together as a team. This has been the most rewarding chapter of my professional career and I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished_ which has been made possible only by you_” Jones said in a memo to staff. The announcement comes nearly two months after Comcast announced a plan to spin off most of its cable TV networks into a separate publicly traded company_ currently known as SpinCo. The new company will include MSNBC_ CNBC_ the USA Network_ Oxygen_ E!_ SYFY and the Golf Channel. Jones took charge of MSNBC in February 2021 after the inauguration of President Joe Biden and the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. She drove MSNBC to ratings triumphs on major political nights. She retained and signed new long-term deals with the network’s top talent_ including Rachel Maddow.

The network still ended last year as the No. 2 network across cable_ with 807_000 average viewers daily and 1.3 million viewers in the prime-time hours. The cable television business writ large is at a crossroads as consumers move toward streaming alternatives such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

MSNBC is well-positioned for the future_” Lazarus said in a memo to staff. Lazarus told staff members on a network call that MSNBC will retain its name after the spin-off transaction is complete.

280435224,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been arrested_ six weeks after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law.  A motorcade of black SUVs was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where he had been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire and a small army of personal security.  Mr Yoon said the “rule of law has completely collapsed” in a video message recorded before he was escorted to the headquarters of an anti-corruption agency.  He said he was complying with the detention warrant to prevent clashes between police and the presidential security service.  Police had been trying to access the president’s official office to detain him but had become engaged in a standoff with Mr Yoon’s security service.  Hours later hundreds of officers made it onto the grounds of the property by using ladders to climb over barriers.  Earlier police said they had deployed 3_200 officers to execute the arrest warrant.  One person who collapsed amid the standoff has been transported away from the scene by the fire department_ local media said.  The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police are jointly investigating whether Mr Yoon’s martial law declaration on 3 December amounted to an attempted rebellion.  What happened on 3 December?  Mr Yoon declared martial law and deployed troops around the National Assembly at the beginning of last month.  It lasted only hours before politicians managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.  His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December_ accusing him of rebellion.  Mr Yoon has argued his declaration of martial law was a legitimate act of governance_ calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party_ which he has described as “despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces”.  He claimed the party used its legislative majority to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget.  Over the past two weeks_ thousands of anti- and pro-Yoon protesters have gathered daily in competing rallies near his office in Seoul_ in anticipation of his detention.

280427984,The SEC filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk on Tuesday_ alleging the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022 by failing to disclose he had amassed an active stake in Twitter_ a secrecy that allowed him to buy shares at “artificially low prices.”  Musk_ who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX_ purchased Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and changed the name to X the following year. Prior to the acquisition_ he’d built up a position in the company of greater than 5%_ which would’ve required disclosing his holdings to the public within 10 calendar days of reaching that threshold.   According to the SEC’s civil complaint_ filed in U.S. District Court in Washington_ D.C._ Musk was more than 10 days late in reporting that material information_ “allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.”  The SEC had been investigating whether Musk_ or anyone else working with him_ committed securities fraud in 2022 as the Tesla CEO sold shares in his car company and shored up his stake in Twitter ahead of his leveraged buyout. Musk said in a post on X last month that the SEC issued a “settlement demand_” pressuring him to agree to a deal including a fine within 48 hours or “face charges on numerous counts” regarding the purchase of shares.  Musk’s lawyer_ Alex Spiro_ said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the SEC’s action is an admission that “they cannot bring an actual case.” He added that Musk “has done nothing wrong” and called the suit a “sham” and the result of a “multi-year campaign of harassment_” culminating in a “single-count ticky tak complaint.”  Musk is just a week away from having a potentially influential role in government_ as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term begins on Jan. 20. Musk_ who was a major financial backer of Trump in the latter stages of the campaign_ is poised to lead an advisory group that will focus in part on reducing regulations_ including those that affect Musk’s various companies.  In July_ Trump vowed to fire SEC chairman Gary Gensler. After Trump’s election victory_ Gensler announced that he would be resigning from his post instead.  In a separate civil lawsuit concerning the Twitter deal_ the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System sued Musk_ accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in the social network and intent to buy the company. The pension fund’s attorneys argued that Musk_ by failing to clearly disclose his investments_ had influenced other shareholders’ decisions and put them at a disadvantage.  The SEC said that Musk crossed the 5% ownership mark in March 2022 and would have been required to disclose his holdings by March 24.  “On April 4_ 2022_ eleven days after a report was due_ Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC_ disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock_” the complaint says. “That day_ Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price.”  The SEC alleges that Musk spent over $500 million purchasing more Twitter shares during the time between the required disclosure and the day of his actual filing. That enabled him to buy stock from the “unsuspecting public at artificially low prices_” the complaint says. He “underpaid” Twitter shareholders by over $150 million during that period_ according to the SEC.  In the complaint_ the SEC is seeking a jury trial and asks that Musk be forced to “pay disgorgement of his unjust enrichment” as well as a civil penalty.  For a brief period in April 2022_ after his ownership had been made public and it was known that he was the biggest shareholder_ Musk was set to join Twitter’s board. However_ he quickly abandoned that plan_ telling the board he would not take a seat.  What followed was a six-month drama that began with Musk submitting an unsolicited bid in mid-April that was opposed by the board. Twitter’s board eventually accepted Musk’s offer later that month. Soon thereafter_ Musk tried to back out_ alleging that Twitter was misstating the number of “bots” on its service  Musk ultimately closed the deal in October 2022_ famously walking into the company’s office in San Francisco with a sink in his hands.  “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!” Musk wrote_ attaching a video of his entrance.
280552320,DOHA_ Qatar — Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war in the Gaza Strip_ multiple officials announced Wednesday_ raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies.  The deal promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel_ and it will allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a territory ravaged by 15 months of war.  The prime minister of Qatar_ Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani_ said the ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday. He made the announcement in the Qatari capital of Doha_ the site of weeks of painstaking negotiations.  U.S. President Joe Biden then touted the deal from Washington_ saying the ceasefire will stay in place as long as Israel and Hamas remain at the negotiating table over a long-term truce. Biden said his administration and President-elect Donald Trump’s team were “speaking as one” in the negotiations.  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that final details were being ironed out and that it hoped “details will be finalized tonight.”  An Israeli official familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity said those details center on confirming the list of Palestinian prisoners who are to be freed. Any agreement must be approved by Netanyahu’s Cabinet.  Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu’s government to approve the ceasefire in a nationally televised speech. Hamas said in a statement that the ceasefire was “the result of the legendary resilience of our great Palestinian people and our valiant resistance in the Gaza Strip.”  Once the deal officially begins_ it is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether.  Over those six weeks_ 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in in captivity with no contact with the outside world_ though it’s unclear if all are alive.  It remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to what remains of their homes and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives.  Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain_ including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction after a brutal conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.  Still_ the announcement offered the first sign of hope in months that Israel and Hamas may be winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought_ a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.  Sen. Dick Durbin_ an Illinois Democrat_ expressed relief at news of the breakthrough_ saying he was “heartened to hear about a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Gaza. The widespread suffering_ death_ and destruction on all sides has been heartbreaking and desperately needed to end.”   Mamayan Jabateh_ a 21-year-old University of Chicago senior who was arrested for their involvement in campus protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza_ described her reaction to the news as “absolutely joy.  “I think this is what student organizers have been wanting for a very long time_” Jabateh said. “We need to restore faith_ we need to build back what was broken. It’s hard looking that far_ but so many people have been harmed_ so many families have been torn apart — and we can be joyful that this moment has finally happened. But I think we can also mourn that it took this long to happen_ and I’m mourning that right now.”  Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7_ 2023_ cross-border attack_ which killed some 1_200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46_000 Palestinians_ according to local health officials_ displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and sparked a humanitarian crisis.  More than 100 hostages were freed from Gaza in a weeklong truce in November 2023.  The U.S._ along with Egypt and Qatar_ have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. It comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in November_ after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in the Gaza.  Israel responded with a brutal air and ground offensive that has killed over 46_000 Palestinians_ according to local health officials. They do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.  U.N. and international relief organizations estimate that some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced_ often multiple times. They say tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hospitals are barely functioning. Experts have warned that famine may be underway in northern Gaza_ where Israel launched a major offensive in early October_ displacing tens of thousands of residents.  “The best day in my life and the life of the Gaza people_” Abed Radwan_ a Palestinian father of three_ said of the ceasefire deal. “Thank God. Thank God.”  Radwan_ who has been displaced from the town of Beit Lahiya for over a year and shelters in Gaza City_ said he will try to return to his hometown_ and “rebuild my house_ and rebuild Beit Lahiya.”  He spoke to AP over the phone. His voice has been overshadowed by celebrations. “People are crying here. They don’t believe it’s true.”  In Israel_ hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv_ calling for a deal to be completed. Many held posters of hostages held by Hamas_ others hoisted candles in the air.  As the deal was announced_ some people were unaware that it had gone through. Sharone Lifschitz_ whose father Oded is being held in Gaza_ told the AP by phone she was stunned and grateful but won’t believe it until she sees all the hostages come home.  “I’m so desperate to see them if by some miracle my father has survived_” she said.  Biden_ who has provided crucial military aid to Israel but expressed exasperation over civilian deaths_ announced the outline of the three-phase ceasefire agreement on May 31. The agreement eventually agreed to followed that framework.  He said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a “full and complete ceasefire_” a withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages_ including women_ older adults and wounded people_ in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian assistance would surge_ with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza each day.  The second and most difficult phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages_ including male soldiers_ and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. The third phase calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza_ which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.  Hamas had been demanding assurances for a permanent end to the war and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel_ meanwhile_ has repeatedly said it would not halt the war until it destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities.  The various players have conducted months of on-again_ off-again negotiations. But with Biden’s days in office numbered and President-elect Donald Trump set to take over_ both sides had been under heavy pressure to agree to a deal.  Trump celebrated the soon-to-be-announced agreement in a posting on his Truth Social social media platform: “WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!”  Hezbollah’s acceptance of a ceasefire in Lebanon after it had suffered heavy blows_ and the overthrow of President Bashar Assad in Syria_ were both major setbacks for Iran and its allies across the region_ including Hamas_ which was left increasingly isolated.  Israel has come under heavy international criticism_ including from its closest ally_ the United States_ over the civilian toll. Israel says it has killed around 17_000 militants — though it has not provided evidence to support the claim. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties_ accusing the group of using schools_ hospitals and residential areas for military purposes.  The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations brought by South Africa that Israel has committed genocide. The International Criminal Court_ a separate body also based in The Hague_ has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu_ his defense minister and a Hamas commander for war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the war.  Israel and the United States have condemned the actions taken by both courts.  Netanyahu also faced great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages_ whose plight has captured the nation’s attention. Their families have become a powerful lobbying group with wide public support backed by months of mass protests urging the government to reach a deal with Hamas.  Israeli authorities have already concluded that more than a third of the roughly 100 remaining people held captive are dead_ and there are fears that others are no longer alive. A series of videos released by Hamas showing surviving hostages in distress_ combined with news that a growing number of abducted Israelis have died_ put added pressure on the Israeli leader.  Hamas_ a militant group that does not accept Israel’s existence_ has come under overwhelming pressure from Israeli military operations_ including the invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and the takeover of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders_ including Yahya Sinwar_ who was believed to have helped mastermind the Oct. 7_ 2023_ attack_ have been killed.  But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces_ raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.  Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But it has never been clear what that would entail or if it’s even possible_ given the group’s deep roots in Palestinian society_ its presence in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank_ and its exiled leadership.  If the ceasefire takes hold_ both sides face many difficult and unanswered questions.  As the war winds down_ Netanyahu will face growing calls for postwar investigations that could find him at least partially responsible for the security failures of Oct. 7 — the worst in Israel’s history. His far-right governing partners_ who opposed a ceasefire deal_ could also bring down the coalition and push the country into early elections.  There is still no plan for who will govern Gaza after the war. Israel has said it will work with local Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. But it is unclear if such partners exist_ and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israeli forces.  The United States has tried to advance sweeping postwar plans for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza with Arab and international assistance. As part of those plans_ the U.S. hope Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in return for U.S. security guarantees and aid in setting up a civilian nuclear program.  But those plans depend on credible progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state_ something Netanyahu and much of Israel’s political class oppose. Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank_ territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for their future state.  In the absence of a postwar arrangement with Palestinian support_ Hamas is likely to remain a significant force in Gaza and could reconstitute its military capabilities if Israeli forces fully withdraw.

280446670,On the Day of a Solar Opposition  There are many ways to discuss problems_ including the option of not discussing and hoping it goes away. This is a day to avoid that style and opt for clearing the air with something brave and proactive. The lunar opposition to Mars in domestic Cancer throws an adage into the mix: “Tell me early_ I’m your friend. Tell me late_ I’m your critic.”  CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). It’s a full day of back-to-back interactions_ and your high energy will have you shining. You’ll seize the opportunity to uplift and inspire others_ making a positive influence on those lucky enough to cross your path.  AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). If a thing can’t be proven_ why argue the matter? There’s a good reason. Because the discussion tells you something about the other person_ their character_ general communication style and what’s important to them. It’s not about the topic. It’s about the dynamic.  PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). There’s no universally correct way to see things. Everyone has a distorted viewpoint when compared to that of another. You’ll reflect on what could be considered a distortion and how it impacts your judgment_ decisions or understanding of a situation.  ARIES (March 21-April 19). Invite people into your life and plans. While there’s a tipping point where involving too many can become overly complicated or cumbersome_ you’re still far from that number -- so keep the invitations flowing and enjoy the connections you make along the way!  TAURUS (April 20-May 20). For a relationship to work well_ both parties should agree on the boundaries. This is best done organically because people may agree in theory to things they do not agree with in practice.  GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You’ve been influenced by memorable people whose lasting impressions kept you following their advice and examples. You’ll now consider how you can create guides for others.  CANCER (June 22-July 22). The classic question of whether the glass is half-full or half-empty wouldn’t arise if the glass simply matched the amount it held. Thinking about efficiency early in any endeavor will prevent problems and keep the focus productive.  LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). The task will be challenging_ so it will be hard to want to stick with it. Even the smallest thing can become a distraction. Instead of acting on every whim_ jot down unhelpful impulses in a note. This simple act will keep you on track throughout this busy day.  VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). You’ll find yourself in a position to appoint someone in an important role. To assess their potential_ take a close look at their current performance. The evidence will speak for itself_ and you can safely assume that what’s happening now will happen again later.  LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). The ways you protect yourself from the world will be highlighted. While some boundaries are essential_ others might be keeping you from experiencing the joy and connection you deserve. Where can you open up more?  SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). There’s a maddening paradox in play: While fairness may be a myth_ so is futility. In the absence of justice_ we can still act and find meaning in the cracks. If nothing is fair_ then we can build something even better: purpose.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You’re a critical thinker_ but you’re careful to communicate in an unfailingly constructive and supportive way_ and even then_ only when asked. People rarely follow the advice they asked for_ and unsolicited advice goes straight to the mental trash bin.  TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 15). Past baggage falls away and you feel powerful_ attractive and vital. People feel important around you because they are_ in fact_ important to you_ and your friendship is an adventure_ a discovery and an art. More highlights: You’ll hit the financial goals you aim for. You’ll become a master of something difficult. A move brings new activities and social circles. Sagittarius and Aquarius adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 13_ 15_ 20_ 11 and 33.  CELEBRITY PROFILES: Martin Luther King Jr.’s enduring legacy continues to inspire and influence in many ways_ including the partnership between the Martin Luther King III Foundation and the NFL_ launching the “Realizing the Dream” initiative to engage youth_ educators and communities worldwide in performing 100 million hours of community service by 2029_ aligning with the centennial of Dr. King’s birth -- a day when Mercury was in the humanitarian sign of Aquarius and the moon was in spiritual Pisces. “All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.” -- Martin Luther King Jr.  Holiday Mathis’ debut novel_ “How To Fail Epically in Hollywood_” is out now!

280547326,By The Associated Press  The Transportation Department is stepping up enforcement of persistent flight delays with a lawsuit against Southwest Airlines and a fine against Frontier Airlines.  The agency said the U.S. District Court lawsuit it filed in California on Wednesday alleges that Southwest illegally operated chronically delayed flights and disrupted passengers’ travel plans. It says it’s seeking “maximum civil penalties.”  “Airlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times_” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “Today’s action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.”  The Transportation Department said its investigation found that Dallas-based Southwest operated two chronically delayed flights – one between Chicago Midway International Airport and Oakland_ California_ and another between Baltimore_ Maryland and Cleveland_ Ohio.  Both flights were chronically delayed for five straight months and together resulted in 180 flight disruptions for passengers between April and August 2022_ the agency said.  The department fined Frontier Airlines $650_000 in civil penalties with $325_000 to be paid to the U.S. Treasury and the remaining $325_000 to be suspended if the carrier does not operate any chronically delayed flights in the next three years.  Aviation-data provider Cirium said in a report released this month that Southwest ranked fifth among the 10 North American airlines it evaluated for their on-time performance_ with 77.8% of arrivals and a little under 77% of departures last year taking place in a timely way. By comparison_ top-ranked Delta Air Lines scored 83.5% for arrivals and 83.7% for departures.  Last year_ federal regulators increased their scrutiny of Southwest Airlines after a series of incidents_ including flying at very low altitudes while still miles away from an airport. The Federal Aviation Administration said in July it wanted to ensure the carrier was complying with federal safety regulations. The FAA declined to provide details_ but noted that it continually adjusts oversight of airlines based on risk.
280813994,Nintendo has released a trailer finally announcing the Switch 2. The trailer_ which starts with the original Switch_ gradually transforms the console into the Switch 2. Check it out below.

280657290,Blue Origin_ the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos_ launched its massive New Glenn rocket for the first time early Thursday_ a livestream of the blastoff showed.The rocket_ whose inaugural mission had been delayed by several years_ blasted of at 2:03 am (0703 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in the US state of Florida_ the webcast showed.The mission is seen as critical to Blue Origin's efforts to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX_ which dominates the commercial space industry."LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars_" Blue Origin said on social media platform X."New Glenn has passed the Karman line_ the internationally recognized boundary of space!" the firm posted just a few minutes later.And then: "Second stage engine cutoff confirmed. New Glenn's second stage and payload are now in orbit."An initial test launch of the towering 320-foot (98-meter) rocket_ dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary American astronaut John Glenn_ had been scrubbed early Monday morning after repeated halts during the countdown.The company later said it had discovered an icing issue on a purge line and would aim for a possible early Tuesday morning launch_ but that weather conditions were unfavorable.On Monday night_ Blue Origin announced that launch had been postponed.With the mission_ dubbed NG-1_ Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: fellow tech innovator Musk.Musk's company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets_ which have become vital for the commercial sector_ Pentagon and NASA."SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town_ and so having a competitor... this is great_" G. Scott Hubbard_ a retired senior NASA official_ earlier told AFP_ expecting the competition to drive down costs.Upping the high-stakes rivalry_ SpaceX also plans another orbital test this week of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket.Blue Origin will now attempt to land New Glenn's first-stage booster on a drone ship stationed about 620 miles (1_000 kilometers) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.SpaceX has made such landings now routine_ but this will be Blue Origin's first shot at the sci-fi feat.High seas last week caused the New Glenn launch to be pushed back several days.Meanwhile_ the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit_ reaching a maximum altitude of roughly 12_000 miles above the surface.A Defense Department-funded prototype of an advanced spaceship called Blue Ring_ which could one day journey through the solar system_ will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.Blue Origin has experience landing its New Shepard rockets -- used for suborbital tourism -- but they are five times smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.Physically_ the gleaming white New Glenn dwarfs SpaceX's 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed for heavier payloads.It slots between Falcon 9 and its big sibling_ Falcon Heavy_ in terms of mass capacity but holds an edge with its wider payload fairing_ capable of carrying the equivalent of 20 moving trucks.Blue Origin has already secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper_ a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.For now_ however_ SpaceX maintains a commanding lead_ while other rivals -- United Launch Alliance_ Arianespace_ and Rocket Lab -- trail far behind.Like Musk_ Bezos has a lifelong passion for space.But where Musk dreams of colonizing Mars_ Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry off-planet onto floating space platforms in order to preserve Earth_ "humanity's blue origin."If New Glenn succeeds_ it will provide the US government "dissimilar redundancy" -- valuable backup if one system fails_ said Scott Pace_ a space policy analyst at George Washington University.

280625008,US President Joe Biden urged Americans Wednesday to "stand guard" against a "dangerous" oligarchy forming under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address before stepping down next week.In a primetime speech from the Oval Office at the end of his single term in office_ the 82-year-old warned of an ultra-wealthy "tech industrial complex" that could gain unchecked power over the American people."Today_ an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth_ power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy_" the 82-year-old Democrat said."That's a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people."Biden also lashed out at social media firms_ with X owner and the world's richest man Elon Musk set to play a key role in Trump's incoming administration and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg courting the Republican."Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation_ enabling the abuse of power_" said Biden.Biden also warned of the dangers of AI_ saying that America must take the "lead" over China on the transformative technology_ and said that "powerful forces" threatened his climate achievements.Signing off Trump returns for a second term on January 20_ Biden told Americans: "Now it's your turn to stand guard." Biden's speech took a dark turn after he began by touting his legacy on the economy_ healthcare_ climate and tackling the gun violence that plagues the United States.America's oldest ever president has spent much of his final months in office trying to burnish his reputation before he is replaced by the bitter political rival he defeated in the 2020 election -- a result Trump still disputes.Biden's efforts got a boost earlier Wednesday when Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal Biden said he'd ordered his administration to cooperate with Trump's team to reach an accord.But his legacy was badly damaged by his decision to run for a second term despite his age.The Democrat was forced to drop out of the race last June after a disastrous debate against Trump_ 78_ who went on to a commanding victory over Biden's vice president_ Kamala Harris.Polls show Biden remains an unpopular president. A CNN poll published Wednesday showed him with a 36 percent approval rating_ remaining at the lowest of his term.That puts him above Trump_ who left office with a 34 percent approval rating_ according to the American Presidency Project. The lowest in recent times was Richard Nixon with 24 percent while the highest was Bill Clinton with 66 percent_ followed by Barack Obama with 59 percent.In a letter previewing his remarks Biden took an implicit swipe at Trump earlier Wednesday_ saying that he "ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake.""And_ that's still the case_" Biden said in the letter.Biden added in the letter that "I have given my heart and my soul to our nation" and that it had been the "privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years."The White House also released a dossier of more than 100-pages setting out his achievements from the economy to healthcare and climate change.In a farewell interview in the Washington Post published Wednesday_ outgoing First Lady Jill Biden took a dig at the Democratic Party for pressing Biden to drop out."Let's just say I was disappointed with how it unfolded_" she said.Emotions ran high at the White House ahead of his speech.Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre -- part of a team that brought back regular media briefings after Trump ended them during his first term -- fought back tears on her last appearance at the famous podium as she described the "honor of a lifetime."

281202256,By MARK SHERMAN_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless it’s sold by its China-based parent company_ holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States.  A sale does not appear imminent and_ although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users’ phones once the law takes effect on Jan. 19_ new users won’t be able to download it and updates won’t be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable_ the Justice Department has said in court filings.  The decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump_ who vowed that he could negotiate a solution and the administration of President Joe Biden_ which has signaled it won’t enforce the law beginning Sunday_ his final full day in office.  Trump_ mindful of TikTok’s popularity_ and his own 14.7 million followers on the app_ finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikTok’s Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now.  It’s unclear what options are open to Trump once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar_ who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration_ told the justices last week that it’s uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok.  “Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary_” the court said in an unsigned opinion_ adding that the law “does not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.”  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch filed short separate opinions noting some reservations about the court’s decision but going along with the outcome.  At arguments_ the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd._ the Chinese technology company that is its parent_ how difficult it would be to consummate a deal_ especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.  The app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long_ according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive and harms kids’ mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate.  The dispute over TikTok’s ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing.  The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data_ including sensitive information on viewing habits_ that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities_ who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.  TikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok.  Bipartisan majorities in Congress passed legislation_ and President Joe Biden signed it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok_ which the government sees as a national security threat.  TikTok_ which sued the government last year over the law_ has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December_ prompting TikTok’s quick appeal to the Supreme Court.  Without a sale to an approved buyer_ the law bars app stores operated by Apple_ Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok.  ByteDance has said it won’t sell. But some investors have been eyeing it_ including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s U.S. assets. The consortium_ which includes “Shark Tank” host Kevin O’Leary_ did not disclose the financial terms of the offer.  Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect “might be just the jolt” ByteDance needs to reconsider its position.

281239650,The Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has been moved indoors due to cold weather.  “The various Dignitaries and Guests will be brought into the Capitol.

Biden said in a statement that commuting the nearly 2_500 sentences would help "equalize" sentencing disparities. "Today’s clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine_ as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes_" he said. "This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs_ correcting sentencing disparities_ and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars_" he added. "With this action_ I have now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history_" Biden said. Almost two dozen congressional Democrats last month urged Biden to commute the sentences of people affected by the sentencing disparities_ arguing that harsher penalties for crack “caused disproportionate harm to communities of color.” Two laws dramatically shifted sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses over the past 15 years. The Fair Sentencing Act_ which was signed into law in 2010_ lowered the statutory penalties for crack cocaine and tossed out the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing it. The First Step Act_ which became law in 2018_ made it possible to apply the reduced penalties to sentences for crack offenses that predated the 2010 law. Biden last month commuted nearly 1_500 sentences and issued pardons for 39 people in another sweeping clemency action. A subsequent move to commute 37 death sentences left only a handful of people on federal death row. According to the Justice Department’s clemency statistics_ President-elect Donald Trump issued 144 pardons and 94 commutations during his first term. President Barack Obama issued 212 pardons and 1_715 commutations over two terms. Perhaps the most controversial use of Biden's clemency power came when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden last month. The move was sharply criticized by Republicans and even some Democrats. In his statement Friday_ Biden indicated that he could take more clemency action before he leaves office Monday. "I am proud of my record on clemency and will continue to review additional commutations and pardons_" he said.
280969276,The actor Justin Baldoni filed a defamation lawsuit against the Hollywood stars Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds on Thursday_ claiming that they tried to destroy him by accusing him of sexual harassment against the actress and then retaliation against her through a smear campaign.  The lawsuit is the latest legal action in a feud tied to the 2024 film “It Ends With Us_” which starred Ms. Lively and Mr. Baldoni_ who also directed it.  The 179-page complaint_ filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York_ named Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds_ her husband_ as defendants_ as well as their publicist Leslie Sloane and her company_ Vision PR. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Mr. Baldoni; the film’s lead producer_ Jamey Heath; their production company_ Wayfarer Studios; and the publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel. They are seeking $400 million in damages.  Representatives for Ms. Lively’s team did not respond to a request for comment.  The New York Times published an article on Dec. 21 about Ms. Lively’s allegations against Mr. Baldoni. She claimed in a complaint_ filed a day earlier with the California Civil Rights Department_ that Mr. Baldoni had initiated the campaign after she accused him of sexual harassment during the shooting of “It Ends With Us.”
281122306,Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright_ who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II_ has died. She was 95.  In a statement Friday_ her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall_ a retirement home for actors in southern England_ surrounded by her loved ones.  "She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre_ film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire_" the family said. "We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being."  Part of an astonishing generation of British actors_ including Judi Dench_ Vanessa Redgrave_ Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith_ Plowright won a Tony Award_ two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.  From the 1950s to the 1980s_ Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" to William Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's "The Chairs_" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles "Major Barbara" and "Saint Joan."  "I've been very privileged to have such a life_" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with The Actor's Work. "I mean it's magic and I still feel_ when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain_ the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me."  Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg_ Lincolnshire_ England_ her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school_ she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester_ then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.  Following her London stage debut in 1954_ Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men_ such as John Osborne_ who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new_ rough-hewn_ working-class actors like Albert Finney_ Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.  Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's "Moby Dick" in 1956_ starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.  A year later_ she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's "The Entertainer." She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.  By then_ Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended_ as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961_ while both were starring on Broadway_ he in "Becket" and she in "A Taste of Honey_" for which she won a Tony.  One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: "I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you_ or write to you - a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence_ passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody."  Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that_ Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60_ satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.  She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of "Surviving Picasso_" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of "101 Dalmatians" in 1996 with Glenn Close.  She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip "Dennis the Menace_" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire "Last Action Hero" in 1993.  Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year_ in 1993_ when she won the supporting actress TV award for "Stalin" and the supporting actress movie award for "Enchanted April." For the latter_ which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy_ she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.  Not all her works were career roses_ as with the disastrous "The Scarlet Letter" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on "Driving Miss Daisy." An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy "Goose on the Loose" didn't rouse critics.  A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame - bestowing awards_ defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.  "That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him_" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. "When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes_ then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight."  Plowright is survived by her three children - Tamsin_ Richard and Julie-Kate_ all actors_ and several grandchildren.

281166246,Medicare announced Friday that it has selected 15 drugs_ including the hugely popular medications Ozempic and Wegovy_ used for diabetes and weight loss_ as well as some blockbuster cancer medications and other drugs_ for its second round of price talks. Together with the first 10 drugs that the Biden administration targeted for its Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program last year_ the medications make up a third of prescription drug spending in the government insurance program for seniors.Prices negotiated in this second round of talks are slated to take effect in 2027. The drugs announced Friday by the Biden administration are:Ozempic; Rybelsus; WegovyTrelegy ElliptaXtandiPomalystIbranceOfevLinzessCalquenceAustedo; Austedo XRBreo ElliptaTradjentaXifaxanVraylarJanumet; Janumet XROtezlaUnder the program's timeline_ drugmakers have until Feb. 28 to decide whether to either participate in the talks or face a hefty tax if they want to stay covered by Medicare and Medicaid.The White House says the first round of negotiations lowered the price of some of the most commonly used drugs in Medicare by about 40% to 80% compared to their list price_ though researchers estimate the actual savings were significantly smaller for many drugs. Those reduced prices go into effect next year.President Biden has touted the program_ created by the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law in 2022_ as one of his term's signature accomplishments."The Inflation Reduction Act put the country on a path to lower drug prices. I'm proud of my Administration's implementation of this law to deliver lower prices for America's seniors_" he said in a statement. Drugmakers have sought in court to stop the process. Industry groups and Republicans have blasted the "price-setting scheme" as unfair and discouraging innovation. The new round of talks come as the Biden administration has also proposed expanding Medicare coverage to weight loss drugs_ which had previously been prohibited. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the move. Can Trump change or halt the process?It is unclear whether President-elect Donald Trump would seek to change the drugs picked or stop the talks after he takes office. On the campaign trail_ he often pledged not to make cuts to Medicare after Democrats sought to tie him to a "Project 2025" proposal to undo the program. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not respond to a request for comment.Speaking with reporters on Thursday_ a senior Biden administration official said that the process to pick the drugs for the negotiation program was hemmed in by the law Congress passed.That law requires Medicare to essentially make a list of eligible drugs for the program_ and then select the drugs that make up the 15 highest in spending from Part D.They acknowledged that there were "very marginal decisions" that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had made in its guidance on how and when the drug talks would occur_ but those would not allow for a major change in which drugs were picked."That process_ again_ is clearly defined in statute. There is no ability for a policy official to say_ I prefer this drug over that drug. The entire process is based on these data_" the official said.Which drugs were selected for the first round?The Biden administration announced the 10 drugs selected for the first round of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in August 2023_ and reached an agreement in August 2024. The negotiated prices will take effect in 2026. Those drugs are:Merck Sharp Dohme's JanuviaNovo Nordisk's Fiasp and NovoLogAstraZeneca's FarxigaImmunex's EnbrelBoehringer Ingelheim's JardianceJanssen's Stelara Janssen's XareltoBristol Meyers Squibb's EliquisNovartis' EntrestoPharmacyclics' ImbruvicaCMS estimated last year that the savings they negotiated from the program would save around $1.5 billion for beneficiaries and $6 billion for the Medicare program.

281315844,The cease-fire between Hamas and Israel will go into effect in less than 24 hours_ said Qatar’s foreign ministry on Saturday. In a post on X_ Qatar’s foreign minister Majid Al Ansari_ said the cease-fire will start at 8:30 a.m. local time Sunday. He advised people to exercise caution when the agreement goes into effect and wait for directions from officials. Early Saturday morning_ Israel’s Cabinet approved the deal for a cease-fire in Gaza that would release dozens of hostages and pause the 15-month war with Hamas_ bringing the sides a step closer to ending their deadliest and most destructive fighting ever. Despite the cease-fire news_ sirens sounded across central Israel on Saturday_ with the army saying it intercepted projectiles launched from Yemen. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have stepped up their missile attacks_ in recent weeks. The group says the attacks are part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza. There were also continued Israeli strikes into Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 23 people were killed in the previous day. Under the first phase of the cease-fire_ 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks_ in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The remainder_ including male soldiers_ are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal. According to the cease-fire plan_ approved by the Cabinet and signed by Israel’s national security adviser_ the exchange will begin Sunday at 4 p.m. local time. During each exchange_ prisoners will be released by Israel after the hostages have arrived safely. The plan says that during the first phase_ some 1_900 Palestinian prisoners will be released_ in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages_ both alive and dead. Among the prisoners_ 1_167 are residents in Gaza who were held by Israel but were not involved in Hamas' Oct. 7_ 2023_ cross-border attack on Israel. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase. Palestinian prisoners who were convicted in the deadly attacks will be exiled_ either to Gaza or abroad_ and barred from returning to Israel or the West Bank_ according to the plan. Some will be exiled for three years and others permanently_ according to the plan. Key questions remain about the cease-fire_ however — the second achieved during the war — including the names of the 33 hostages who are to be released and who among them is still alive. Hamas has agreed to free three female hostages on Day 1 of the deal_ four on Day 7 and the remaining 26 over the following five weeks. Also during the first phase_ Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a half-mile wide inside Gaza_ along its borders with Israel. That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes_ including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza’s population driven into massive_ squalid tent camps_ Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes_ even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. The largely devastated territory should also see a surge in humanitarian aid. Trucks carrying aid lined up Friday on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza. On Saturday_ two Egyptian government ministers arrived in the northern Sinai Peninsula to oversee the preparations for the delivery of aid and to receive the evacuation of wounded patients_ the health ministry said. Hamas triggered the war with its 2023 attack into Israel that killed some 1_200 people and left some 250 others captive. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza. Israel responded with devastating air and ground attacks that have killed more than 46_000 Palestinians_ according to local health officials_ who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half the dead. Magdy and Mednick write for the Associated Press and reported from Cairo and Jersusalem_ respectively. AP reporter Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

281327736,On the flip side_ here are a few players we are sitting in during this Saturday afternoon’s Kansas City vs. Houston DFS.  John Metchie III (4_000-DraftKings/5_500-Fanduel)  Wide receiver John Metchie III is a player who should be on the fantasy bench for today’s DFS game. Metchie during the win against the Chargers had a fumble and 28 yards. The young Texans receiver has been struggling with fumbles this season_ which could cost players money. Fantasy players should sit Metchie down for today due to the Chiefs’ solid defense.  Travis Kelce (5_000-DraftKings/6_500-Fanduel)  Travis Kelce is another player who could have a rough night for fantasy players and should be sitting in today’s DFS game. Kelce this season had a weak season with 823 yards and 3 touchdowns. While the veteran could be a threat today_ he is also a non-factor for today’s fantasy. Kelce could be covered well with the Texans’ defense being hot during this playoff season.  Total Apex Lock of the Game  Xavier Worthy (5_200-DraftKings/6_400-Fanduel)  For the Total Apex lock of the game_ Chiefs receiver Xavier Worthy should be your lock of the day. The rookie receiver this season had 638 receiving yards_ and 9 touchdowns. He could have a strong game against the Texans’ secondary in Kansas City_ potentially scoring with a rushing and receiving touchdown.   Total Apex Fade of the Game  Hollywood Brown (5_700-DraftKings/6_000 Fanduel)  The Total Apex fade of the game will be Hollywood Brown of the Chiefs should be on the bench today. Brown this season despite injuries had 91 yards and no touchdowns. This season was a nightmare for him due to injuries and could have a weak game tonight. Houston could have coverages that could impact Brown heavily for their matchup today. With a hot Houston defense coming to Kansas_ fantasy players should avoid Hollywood today.  The NFL playoffs are getting hot for the divisional rounds_ and Saturday afternoon’s DFS game could help fantasy players win cash. Kansas City could have a strong game with fantasy players due to the weapons they have on offense_ including their run game. Along with the Chiefs’ run game_ the receiving core could do well with their veteran receivers today.  However_ the Chiefs offensive stars could suffer for fantasy players. There is also the Texans offense struggling horribly which could cost fantasy players money. Houston’s offense has been putrid with their offensive line struggling even during the win against the Chargers. Fantasy players could win easy cash prizes in this Saturday afternoon game of football. The NFL divisional games could be easy money because of the intensity of the playoffs and pressure from both teams.
281314458,TikTok said late Friday that its service would “go dark” for its 170 million American users on Sunday because of a ban in the United States over fears that its Chinese ownership poses a threat to national security.  The company said in a statement that “unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19” unless the Biden administration assures Apple_ Google and other companies that they would not be punished for delivering TikTok’s services in the United States.  The statement was TikTok’s latest attempt to pressure the administration to grant it a reprieve from a law_ upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday_ that would effectively ban its service starting Sunday.  The law says that app stores and major cloud computing providers cannot deliver TikTok to U.S. consumers unless the company is sold by its Chinese parent company_ ByteDance_ to a non-Chinese owner.

281332302,The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit on Friday accusing Walgreens of filling millions of unlawful opioid prescriptions.The civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Walgreen Boots Alliance_ Walgreen Co. and its various subsidiaries alleges the pharmacy giant knowingly filled millions of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances from approximately August 2012 through to the present. Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids_ the lawsuit said_ including early refills among other prescriptions. "Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful_ and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions_ including controlled substance prescriptions_ without taking the time needed to confirm their validity_" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton_ head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. "These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores." Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear "red flags_" the complaint alleges_ and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions_ including from its own pharmacists and internal data_ the suit claims.Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity_ the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions_ the statement said. Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands "behind our pharmacists_ dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve_ filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.""We look forward to the opportunity to defend the professionalism and integrity of our pharmacists_" the statement said.Last month the Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit against CVS_ alleging the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions with dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids_ agreed to fill opioid prescriptions early and made "trinity prescriptions_" which are a dangerous combination of drugs.Walgreens is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains_ with over 8_000 pharmacies across the U.S. Walgreens plans to close hundreds of stores by the end of 2025 to turn around its flagging sales_ and has already closed roughly 2_000 locations over the past decade_ the company said.
281319798,By LOLITA C. BALDOR  WASHINGTON (AP) — It is unclear who will take over at the Pentagon and the military services when the top leaders all step down Monday as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.  As of Friday_ officials said they had not yet heard who will become the acting defense secretary. Officials said the military chiefs of the Army_ Navy and Air Force were getting ready to step in as acting service secretaries — a rare move — because no civilians had been named or_ in some cases_ had turned down the opportunity.  As is customary_ all current political appointees will step down as of noon EST on Inauguration Day_ leaving hundreds of key defense posts open_ including dozens that require Senate confirmation. In addition to the top job and all three service secretaries_ all of their deputies and senior policy staff will leave.  The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to vote Monday on Trump’s choice to head the Defense Department_ Pete Hegseth_ but the full Senate vote may not happen until days later. As a result someone from the Biden administration would have to take over temporarily.  For the service secretaries_ officials said that while things could still change before the inauguration_ the Trump team is eyeing Gen. Randy George_ chief of staff of the Army_ to be that service’s temporary head. They said Gen. David Allvin_ chief of staff of the Air Force_ and Adm. Lisa Franchetti_ the Navy chief_ are aware they may have to step in if no civilian is named as acting secretary_ and they are preparing for that possibility.  The officials_ who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations_ said many senior Biden administration leaders are reluctant to serve in the incoming Trump administration because they are concerned about policy changes they may be required to handle or enforce.  Usually_ only people appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate serve as a defense or service secretary_ including in an acting capacity during a transition. Trump could pull a confirmed member of the Biden administration from another agency and put that person at the Pentagon.  Civilian control of the military is a key tenet_ but under the law the military chiefs of the services — who are all Senate confirmed — can take over on a temporary basis. It’s rare_ but did happen more than 30 years ago.  Arnold Punaro_ a retired Marine Corps Reserve two-star general_ said that in 1993_ Adm. Frank Kelso_ who was Navy chief_ was asked to serve as acting Navy secretary when Bill Clinton became president because civilian leaders did not step up.  “It doesn’t happen very often_” said Punaro_ who spent 14 years as a staff director on the Senate Armed Services Committee and has advised nominees through the confirmation process for decades. “Normally you don’t want the active-duty military serving in the civilian control positions. The practical reality is they are wearing both hats.”  The transition to a new secretary of defense has usually been an orderly process.  Four years ago_ the deputy secretary of defense under Trump_ David Norquist_ became acting secretary for the two-day gap between the inauguration of Democratic President Joe Biden and the Senate vote to confirm Lloyd Austin as Pentagon chief.  President Barack Obama asked his Republican predecessor’s defense secretary_ Robert Gates_ to stay on as his own Pentagon leader in 2009.  In 2017_ Jim Mattis_ Trump’s pick to be secretary during his first term_ was confirmed on Inauguration Day.  This year’s gap is further complicated by the fact that Trump and Hegseth have both pledged ro rid the Defense Department of what they call “woke” generals — or those who have supported diversity programs. That raises the possibility that even as the administration struggles to fill its political appointee slots_ it may also be carving holes in the military leadership structure that will have to be filled.  When Sen. Elissa Slotkin_ D-Mich._ asked Hegseth during his nomination hearing if he intended to fire the current Joint Chiefs chairman_ Gen. CQ Brown_ he answered_ “Senator_ every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy_ standards_ lethality_ and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.”  Hegseth previously said that Brown should be fired. Conservative groups have compiled lists of generals they believe should be fired for supporting diversity programs. If Brown is fired_ the vice chairman would take over until a new chairman is confirmed.  Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report.
281532812,Washington — TikTok voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. late Saturday night_ cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court_ but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.The court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S._ agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans. While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration_ the company itself took itself offline shortly before the midnight deadline on Sunday. Users in the U.S. who opened the app Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline_ "Sorry_ TikTok isn't available right now." "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S._" the message reads. "Unfortunately_ that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!"CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment. The app was no longer available in the Apple store as of 10:50 p.m. Eastern Time. On Friday_ TikTok said it would "be forced to go dark" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal "a stunt" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday_" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Even if President-elect Trump declines to enforce the ban_ the law would still be on the books_ and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to "save" TikTok_ and said Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done_ because it's appropriate_" he said in the phone interview_ adding_ "if I decide to do that_ I'll probably announce it on Monday."The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress. During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10_ Noel Francisco_ a lawyer for TikTok_ warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect_ explaining that it would be "extraordinarily difficult" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user. "As I understand it_ we go dark_" Francisco said. This is a developing story and will be updated.
281703472,Though President-elect Donald Trump had urged the US Supreme Court to delay deliberations on a challenge to that ban_ they issued a ruling on Friday upholding the law. Ninety minutes before its shutdown deadline on Saturday_ the app went dark_ replaced with a message that read_ “Sorry_ TikTok isn’t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately_ that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” That solution came sooner than expected_ it appears_ as the company tweeted Sunday that “In agreement with our service providers_ TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.” This is a breaking story_ please check back for updates.
281564216,The company announced the shutdown in a pop-up message on the app that only allows users to “learn more” about the federal law or close the app. The message says_ “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately_ that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!”  The app is also no longer available on the Google and Apple app stores. App providers risked massive fines of $5_000 a day per user if they kept offering the app.  TikTok previously told users at 9 p.m. about the looming shutdown in a pop-up message that said_ “We regret that a U.S. law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible_ and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned.”  Users at the time_ however_ could dismiss the message and continue scrolling through videos. The app was completely shut down around two hours later.  TikTok’s shutdown comes as the company warned on Friday that it would “go dark” unless the Biden administration “immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement” of a federal law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court requiring TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  The White House brushed off that threat of a service shutdown_ with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre calling it a “stunt.” Jean-Pierre advised that TikTok should work with the incoming Trump administration on the ban.   President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he’d “most likely” grant TikTok a 90-day extension to avoid a ban from U.S. app stores.
281512440,President-elect Donald Trump arrived in Washington Saturday to kick off days of pageantry heralding his second inauguration as president_ four years after he departed the city under the shadow of an attack by his supporters on the Capitol.His plane landed at Dulles Airport in the evening before he headed to Trump Sterling Golf Club.Earlier_ Trump_ Melania and their son Barron boarded the plane at 5:13 p.m. Eastern Time and departed Palm Beach_ Florida_ from Mar-a-Lago_ where his team has spent his transition since he won the election. The three of them turned around at the top of the stairs_ and Trump waved before heading inside the plane. The ritualistic changing of power will get underway as Washington's solemn pomp is paired with Trump's brand of party: a fireworks showcase at one of his luxury golf properties_ guests including tech industry titans_ friends from the business world and conservative media stars_ and thousands of his supporters streaming in from around the country.With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation's capital facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday's outdoor events_ including the swearing-in ceremony."There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country_" Trump wrote on Truth Social. "I don't want to see people hurt_ or injured_ in any way...Therefore_ I have ordered the Inauguration Address_ in addition to prayers and other speeches_ to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda_ as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985_ also because of very cold weather."Country music stars Carrie Underwood_ Billy Ray Cyrus and Jason Aldean_ disco band the Village People_ rapper Nelly and musician Kid Rock are all scheduled to perform at inauguration-related ceremonies and events. Actor Jon Voight and wrestler Hulk Hogan are also expected to make appearances_ as are a crew of Trump-embracing business executives: Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk_ Amazon founder Jeff Bezos_ Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.The only public event on Trump's schedule is an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling_ Virginia_ outside the city.While Trump holds court at his club_ Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.On Sunday_ the eve of his inauguration_ Trump is scheduled to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally will be followed by a private dinner.On Inauguration Day_ Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.Trump then heads to the Capitol_ where his ceremony has been moved indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years. It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda_ which holds only 600 people. More than 250_000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds.The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies_ which is responsible for planning the event_ said in a statement that "the vast majority of ticketed guests will not be able to attend the ceremonies in person."Eight years ago_ Trump's critics were wrestling with whether to attend his inauguration_ contemplating whether to buck long-standing practice and send a signal to the divisive new president. This year_ much outspoken resistance to Trump has faded away_ though there will be two notable absences: former first lady Michelle Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Neither gave an explanation as to why she was skipping the ceremony.After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address_ there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power_ Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts_ followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops.The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold_ with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will follow in the evening_ punctuated by musical performances.Trump's arrival in Washington will once again be accompanied by protests and vigils on issues such as abortion_ immigration rights and_ this time_ the Israel-Hamas war_ but the feel and the force of those demonstrations were different from the outset of his first term.The Women's March_ spurred by women outraged over Trump's win in 2017_ drew more than 500_000 people to Washington and millions more in cities around the country_ marking one of the largest single-day demonstrations in U.S. history.The march returned Saturday_ rebranded as the People's March_ with organizers saying their focus will be less on Trump and more on broader goals around women's and reproductive rights_ LGBTQ rights_ immigration_ climate and democracy. It drew far fewer than eight years ago.
281549642,DETROIT — Jayden Daniels threw for two touchdowns in a flawless performance by Washington’s dazzling rookie_ and the Commanders stunned the Detroit Lions 45-31 on Saturday night to reach the NFC championship game for the first time since winning the Super Bowl 33 years ago.  The sixth-seeded Commanders (14-5) were nearly double-digit underdogs against the Super Bowl favorite Lions (15-3) and overcame doubts as they did all season with a rookie quarterback_ new coach and general manager.  Detroit_ the NFC’s No. 1 seed for the first time_ doomed its chances by turning it over five times.  Washington rookie Mike Sainristil had two interceptions_ including one on a trick play with receiver Jameson Williams throwing into coverage off a reverse in the fourth quarter.   And Quan Martin returned a pick 40 yards for a touchdown.  Jared Goff threw three picks and lost a fumble_ turning it over three times in the ill-fated first half.  Daniels finished with 299 yards passing and 51 yards rushing_ and — just as important — didn’t turn the ball over.  First-year coach Dan Quinn led Washington to its first playoff win in 19 years last week.   The Commanders rallied past Tampa Bay for their sixth comeback win and fifth straight on the final play from scrimmage in regulation or overtime.  The Commanders_ who converted 3 of 4 fourth downs_ didn’t let Detroit keep it that close.  Washington outscored Detroit 28-14 in the second quarter — the highest-scoring quarter in NFL playoff history — to take a 31-21 lead at halftime.

281615956,A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip took effect on Sunday after a nearly three-hour delay_ pausing a 15-month-old war that has brought devastation and seismic political change to the Middle East.  Residents and a medical worker in Gaza said that they had heard no new fighting or military strikes since about half an hour before it was finally implemented.  Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians between 0630 GMT_ when the ceasefire was meant to begin_ and 0915 GMT_ when it actually took effect_ Palestinian medics said.  Israel blamed Hamas for the delay after the Palestinian militant group failed to provide a list naming the first three hostages to be released under the deal.  Hamas attributed the delay to “technical” reasons_ without specifying what those were.  A Palestinian official familiar with the matter_ speaking on condition of anonymity_ said the delay occurred because mediators had asked for 48 hours of “calm” before the ceasefire’s implementation_ but continued Israeli strikes right up until the deadline had made it difficult to send the list.  Two hours after the deadline_ Hamas said it had sent the list of names_ and Israeli officials confirmed receipt. Hamas named the hostages it was to release on Sunday as Romi Gonen_ Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari.  Israel did not immediately confirm the names.  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war_ which began after Hamas_ which controls the tiny coastal territory_ attacked Israel on Oct. 7_ 2023_ killing some 1_200 people_ according to Israeli authorities.  Israel’s response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47_000 Palestinians_ according to Gaza-based health authorities.  The war also set off a confrontation throughout the Middle East between Israel and its arch-foe Iran_ which backs Hamas and other anti-Israeli and anti-American paramilitary forces across the region.  Ahead of the ceasefire’s agreed implementation at 0630 GMT_ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.  Israeli military spokespeople said in separate statements on Sunday that their aircraft and artillery had attacked “ terror targets ”in northern and central Gaza_ and that the military would continue to attack the strip as long as Hamas did not meet its obligations under the ceasefire.  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said that at least 13 people were killed in the Israeli attacks and dozens wounded. Medics reported tanks firing at the Zeitoun area of Gaza City_ and said that an airstrike and tank fire also hit the northern town of Beit Hanoun_ sending residents who had returned there in anticipation of the ceasefire fleeing.  An air raid siren that sounded in the Sderot area of southern Irael had been a false alarm_ the Israeli military said in a separate statement.  Israeli forces had started withdrawing from areas in Gaza’s Rafah to the Philadelphi corridor along the border between Egypt and Gaza_ pro-Hamas media reported early on Sunday.  The three-stage ceasefire agreement followed months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egypt_ Qatar and the United States_ and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.  Its first stage will last six weeks_ during which 33 of the remaining 98 hostages – women_ children_ men over 50_ the ill and wounded – will be released in return for almost 2_000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.  They include 737 male_ female and teen-aged prisoners_ some of whom are members of militant groups convicted of attacks that killed dozens of Israelis_ as well as hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza in detention since the start of the war.  The first three are female hostages expected to be released through the Red Cross on Sunday. In return for each_ 30 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails are to be released.  Under the terms of the deal_ Hamas will inform the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) where the meeting point will be inside Gaza and the ICRC is expected to begin driving to that location to collect the hostages_ an official involved in the process told Reuters.  President Joe Biden’s team worked closely with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to push the deal over the line.  As his inauguration approached_ Trump had repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly_ warning repeatedly that there would be “hell to pay” if the hostages were not released.  But what will come next in Gaza remains unclear in the absence of a comprehensive agreement on the postwar future of the enclave_ which will require billions of dollars and years of work to rebuild.  And although the stated aim of the ceasefire is to end the war entirely_ it could easily unravel.  Hamas_ which has controlled Gaza for almost two decades_ has survived despite losing its top leadership and thousands of fighters.  Israel has vowed it will not allow Hamas to return to power and has cleared large stretches of ground inside Gaza_ in a step widely seen as a move towards creating a buffer zone that will allow its troops to act freely against threats in the enclave.  In Israel_ the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure that led to the deadliest single day in the country’s history.  The war sent shockwaves across the region_ triggering a conflict with the Tehran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement and bringing Israel into direct conflict with its arch-foe Iran for the first time.  It has also transformed the Middle East. Iran_ which spent billions building up a network of militant groups around Israel_ has seen its “Axis of Resistance” wrecked and was unable to inflict more than minimal damage on Israel in two major missile attacks.  Hezbollah_ whose huge missile arsenal was once seen as the biggest threat to Israel_ has seen its its top leadership killed and most of its missiles and military infrastructure destroyed.  On the diplomatic front_ Israel has faced outrage and isolation over the death and devastation in Gaza.  Netanyahu faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant on war crimes allegations and separate accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice.  Israel has reacted with fury to both cases_ rejecting the charges as politically motivated and accusing South Africa_ which brought the original ICJ case as well as the countries that have joined it_ of antisemitism.
281582146,The deadline for the start of a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip passed as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would not begin until Hamas provides the names of the three hostages it was set to release later Sunday in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners. The dispute had not been resolved when the deadline for the truce to begin passed at 8:30 a.m. local time. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari_ the top Israeli military spokesman_ said the army “continues to attack_ even now_ inside the Gaza arena_" and would until Hamas complies with the agreement. Meanwhile_ Israel announced that it had recovered the body of Oron Shaul_ a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war_ in a special operation. The bodies of Shaul and another soldier_ Hadar Goldin_ remained in Gaza after the 2014 war and had not been returned despite a public campaign by their families. Netanyahu said he had instructed the military that the cease-fire “will not begin until Israel has in its possession the list of hostages to be freed_ which Hamas committed to provide.” He had issued a similar warning the night before. Hamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on “technical field reasons.” The militant group said in a statement that it is committed to the cease-fire agreement announced last week. The planned cease-fire_ agreed upon after a year of intensive mediation by the United States_ Qatar and Egypt_ is the first step in a long and fragile process aimed at winding down the 15-month war. The 42-day first phase of the cease-fire should see a total of 33 hostages returned from the Gaza Strip and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. Israeli forces should pull back into a buffer zone inside Gaza_ and many displaced Palestinians should be able to return home. The devastated territory should also see a surge in humanitarian aid. This is just the second cease-fire in the war_ longer and more consequential than the weeklong pause more than a year ago_ with the potential to end the fighting for good. Negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of this cease-fire should begin in just over two weeks. Major questions remain_ including whether the war will resume after the six-week first phase and how the rest of the nearly 100 hostages in Gaza will be freed. Dozens of people took to the streets in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Yunis to celebrate the cease-fire_ according to an Associated Press reporter. Four masked and armed Hamas fighters arrived in two vehicles as the celebrations were underway_ with people welcoming them and chanting slogans in support of the militant group. The Hamas-run police began deploying in public after mostly lying low for months due to Israeli airstrikes. Gaza City residents said they had seen them operating in parts of the city_ and the AP reporter in Khan Yunis saw a small number out on the streets. Palestinian residents began returning to their homes in parts of Gaza City early Sunday_ even as tank shelling continued overnight to the east_ closer to the Israeli border. Families could be seen making their way back on foot with their belongings loaded on donkey carts_ residents said. “The sound of shelling and explosions didn’t stop_” said Ahmed Matter_ a Gaza City resident. He said he saw many families leaving their shelters and returning to their homes. “People are impatient. They want this madness to end." Israel’s Cabinet approved the cease-fire early Saturday in a rare session during the Jewish Sabbath_ more than two days after mediators announced the deal. Israel and Hamas were under pressure from the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump's team to achieve a deal before the presidential inauguration on Monday. The toll of the war has been immense_ and new details on its scope will soon emerge. More than 46_000 Palestinians have been killed_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll_ but says at least half of the dead are women and children. The Oct. 7_ 2023_ a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war killed over 1_200 people_ mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died. Some 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The United Nations says the health system_ road network and other vital infrastructure have been badly damaged. Rebuilding — if the cease-fire reaches its final phase — will take several years at least. Major questions about Gaza’s future_ political and otherwise_ remain unresolved. Shurafa_ Magdy and Goldenberg write for the Associated Press and reported from Deir al Balah_ Cairo and Tel Aviv_ respectively. Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

281986652,Ivanka Trump looked effortlessly chic in an all-green outfit as she arrived ahead of father Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday morning.  The President-elect’s eldest daughter was seen in the deep forest green ensemble as she arrived at the service at St. John’s Church_ as Trump prepares for his second presidential term.  Ivanka looked stunning in a simple yet eye-catching outfit_ wearing a woolen pencil skirt with matching blazer.  The gorgeous jacket was structured around the body_ cinched at the waist with a thin black leather belt. It also featured a chic A-symmetrical element_ with the right-side lapel sweeping down in a waterfall style.  She accessorized with a beret style hat in the same shade_ black high heels_ sheer black tights and leather gloves.  Ivanka wore her hair in a stylish French twist_ and kept her makeup simple_ adding pearl earrings.  The 43-year-old had a stunning Dior bag on her arm_ which appeared to be the Lady Dior Bag in Black Cannage Grained Calfskin with gold finishes_ which retails for $5_900.  Her three children_ whom she shares with husband Jared Kushner_ were also dressed for the occasion.  Daughter Arabella_ 13_ appears to be following in her mother’s stylish footsteps_ wearing a beige ensemble which included a cape and a belt with matching gloves_ which completed her long ark hair which she wore out.  Her sons Joseph_ 11_ and Theodore_ eight_ both wore navy blue suits.  Last night_ Ivanka stunned in an Oscar de la Renta gown at a candlelight dinner at the National Building Museum in Washington_ D.C.  The mother-of-three wore the custom off-shoulder_ crystal-and-pearl_ floral-embroidered empire waist gown with a silver stole to the event_ where she was seen rubbing shoulders with Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.  Ivanka won’t be resuming the same responsibilities as last time her father was in office_ previously stating she wants to be his emotional support this time around.  Instead_ she hopes to just be her father’s emotional support person during this presidential cycle.  ‘I hate politics_’ she confessed. ‘I went through years of craziness.’  ‘It’s the world’s loneliest position_ the enormity of the decisions you’re making on a daily basis_ how transactional everyone is with you.’  However_ Ivanka speaks to her father nearly every day and is likely to be an influence behind-the-scenes even without a formal title.  ‘I’m most looking forward to just being able to show up for him as a daughter and be there for him_ to take his mind off things and like watch a movie with him or watch a sports game_ to know that he can be with me and be himself_ and just relax.’   Ivanka was not involved in her father’s 2024 presidential campaign. It was a stark contrast to the 2020 race_ where she was a regular presence at his rallies.  The dedicated mom said said the main reason she’s not returning to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is her children Arabella_ Joseph And Theodore.  ‘The main reason I am not going back to serve now is_ I know the cost. And it’s a price that I’m not willing to make my kids bear_’ she said.  ‘My primary goals were just to like_ be the best freaking mom_’ she said.  ‘Every time I had to miss something_ I’m like_ I will never let this happen again in the minute I leave the White House.’
281825688,Jan. 20 (UPI) -- Incoming first lady Melania Trump has launched her own cryptocurrency on the eve of her husband_ President-elect Donald Trump_ being inaugurated and days after he announced his own memecoin.  A memcoin is a cryptocurrency inspired by Internet memes_ characters or trends_ according to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase_ which said such currencies are often propped up by online supporters and are generally intended for entertainment.  Melania Trump announced her cryptocurrency in a social media post.  "The Official Melania Meme is Live_" she said. "You can buy $MELANIA now."  The announcement follows Donald Trump on Friday announcing his $TRUMP memecoin.  "It's time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING_" the incoming-president said in a post published to social media platforms_ including his own Truth Social. "Join my very special Trump Community."  Both websites attached to the coins state they each are "digital collectibles intended to function as an expression of support for and engagement with" the values connected with the brands MELANIA and $TRUMP.  Both also state that they are not intended to be an investment opportunity or security.  After Trump announced his memecoin on Friday_ it was condemned by ethics lawyers who accused the incoming president of profiteering from his position in the White House.  "It is literally cashing in on the presidency -- creating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the president's family in connection with his office_" Campaign Legal Center Executive Director Adav Noti told The New York TImes.  "It is beyond unprecedented."  Despite previously being a skeptic of cryptocurrency_ Trump and his family embraced the digital currency during his 2024 campaign_ and he is now ushering in what some analysts have described as a crypto-friendly Cabinet.  Early last month_ Trump named venture capitalist and Elon Musk associate David Sacks to be his so-called artificial intelligence and crypto czar.

281995380,Cecile Richards_ a prominent advocate for women's rights and other progressive causes_ died Monday. In a statement_ her family confirmed her death_ saying she passed away at home_ "surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog_ Ollie."   "Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives_" the statement said.   Richards was best known for her work leading Planned Parenthood through a particularly challenging time which included threats to its funding and the first election of Donald Trump to the presidency.  During more than a decade at the helm of Planned Parenthood_ Richards was often called upon to defend the reproductive health organization against attacks from political opponents. She and her movement faced mounting challenges after Trump_ who ran for President in 2016 on a promise to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade_ was first elected.  At the Women's March in Washington the day after Trump's inauguration in 2017_ Richards addressed thousands of marchers and promised to fight his policies.  "Today we're here to deliver a message: we're not gonna take this lying down_ and we will not go back_" Richards told the crowd.  The next year_ Richards announced she was leaving Planned Parenthood. After leaving the organization_ Richards focused her efforts on leading Supermajority_ a group she'd co-founded to mobilize female voters.  In the years to come_ the Trump administration would take steps designed to reduce access to abortion_ including cutting off funds for groups that make abortion referrals_ like Planned Parenthood_ through an overhaul of the Title X family planning program.  Over the course of his first term_ Trump named three conservative justices to the Supreme Court_ who_ in June of 2022_ would ultimately vote to overturn decades of abortion-rights precedent.  Despite setbacks for the abortion rights movement and a diagnosis of brain cancer_ Richards embodied an "indefatigable" determination_ says former Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis.  "Her belief [was] you can't give up before you even start_ and that it's always worth a fight_" Davis said.  Davis worked closely with Richards during a high-profile battle to defeat an anti-abortion bill in Texas in 2013. Now a senior advisor to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes_ the group's political arm in Texas_ Davis says Richards still inspires her to keep fighting.  "You want to give in to the weariness and give in to just giving up_" Davis said. "When I'm tempted to feel that way_ I think about Cecile_ and I know a lot of people do."  Richards herself drew inspiration from the legacy of her mother_ the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards_ who was known for her sharp wit and down-to-earth demeanor.  During a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2015_ a male lawmaker asked her if she expected the committee "to be easier on you because you're a woman?"  "Absolutely not_" Richards responded. "That's not how my mama raised me."  The hearing stemmed from the release of secretly-recorded videos by the Center for Medical Progress_ an anti-abortion group that accused Planned Parenthood of selling fetal body parts. Planned Parenthood said the sting videos were edited to be deliberately misleading.  Dr. Colleen McNicholas_ Chief Medical Officer at Planned Parenthood Great Rivers in the St. Louis area_ knew Richards for more than a decade through their advocacy for abortion rights.  "I think she really changed the way that the movement engaged publicly; she was a very visible and bold presence_" McNicholas says. "She wasn't afraid to take questions_ to say the word 'abortion.'"  Washington Sen. Patty Murray_ a Democrat with a long history of advocacy for reproductive rights_ credits Richards with an instrumental role in making sure the Affordable Care Act_ which passed under President Barack Obama_ included contraceptive coverage.  Murray says despite the setbacks the movement has faced in recent years_ she sees Richards as an example of continuing to fight.  "I would take what Cecile has done in her lifetime and use it as a charge to all of us now: you move forward_ you fight for what you believe in_ you have the courage to stand up and say what is right_" Murray says. "You take those setbacks_ learn from them_ and move forward_ and she's always done that."  In an Instagram post in January 2024_ months after her cancer diagnosis_ Richards described going through a whirlwind of treatments_ time with family_ and focusing on what was most important — including her continued activism.  "After all_" Richards wrote_ "as my mother used to say: 'Why should your life be just about you?'"  As her health continued to decline_ Richards addressed the 2024 Democratic National Convention.  She spoke of the joy of recently becoming a grandmother_ and the challenges many women have faced since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  "One day_ our children and grandchildren may ask us_ 'When it was all on the line_ what did you do?' And the only acceptable answer is_ everything we could_" Richards said.  In November 2024_ President Joe Biden honored Cecile Richards with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a private ceremony at the White House. In a statement_ Biden praised Richards for her "absolute courage and conviction" and "an inspiring legacy that endures in her incredible family_ the countless lives she has made better_ and a Nation seeking the light of equality_ justice_ and freedom."
281955710,President Joe Biden has taken a stand in his final hours as president ahead of President-Elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on Monday_ Jan. 20.    Early Monday morning_ Biden issued a series of preemptive pardons for several high-profile figures whom Trump has publicly spoken out against. These pardons cannot be undone by the incoming administration.    Some of those preemptive pardons include Dr. Anthony Fauci_ the former chief medical advisor to the president_ who served amidst the COVID pandemic as well as General Mark A. Milley_ the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was appointed by Trump in 2019 during his first administration.    Trump and Milley became at odds after Milley disagreed with Trump’s desire to overturn the results of the 2020 election_ referring to the situation as “a Reichstag moment_” according to the 2021 book I Alone Can Fix It by journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.   Others who made it onto Biden's list of presidential pardons included members who served on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol_ including former Representative Liz Cheney_ Senator Adam Schiff_ former Representative Adam Kinzinger as well as Capitol and Washington D.C. police who testified.    The decision is viewed as a guard against any acts of potential revenge from the incoming Trump administration.    “Our nation relies on dedicated selfless public servants every day_” Biden shared in a statement explaining his preemptive pardons. “They are the lifeblood of our democracy yet alarmingly public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.”   “These pardons should not be mistaken that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing. Nor should acceptance by them be misconstrued as any admission of guilt for any offense_" Biden clarified. "Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”    Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.   The pardons come after Trump has spoken out against many of the individuals. In 2023_ he accused Milley of going behind his back in the final days of the first Trump administration and calling Chinese counterparts.    “[Milley] was actually dealing with China to give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States_” Trump wrote in the post on his Truth Social site at the time. “This is an act so egregious that_ in times gone by_ the punishment would have been death!”   General Milley released a statement regarding the pardon_ saying he was "deeply grateful" to President Biden_ and adding that he_ "does not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me in this life_ fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights."   In December 2024_ Trump told NBC News’ Laura Jarrett that the members of the Jan. 6 committee deserved jail time.    “For what they did_ honestly_ they should go to jail_” Trump said during the interview.    When asked if Cheney should go to jail_ he replied_ “I think everybody on the committee_ anybody that voted in favor [should go to jail].”   Despite this_ Trump also said he had no plans to direct his FBI director or Attorney General to send them to jail.

281936576,By COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLER  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci_ retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol_ using the extraordinary powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential “revenge” by the incoming Trump administration.  The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6_ 2021. Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.  “The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing_ nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense_” Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”  It’s customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term_ but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit admission of guilt or wrongdoing_ even though those who have been pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes.  “These are exceptional circumstances_ and I cannot in good conscience do nothing_” Biden said_ adding that “Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated_ the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”  Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40 years and was Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement in 2022. He helped coordinate the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised the ire of Trump when he refused to back Trump’s unfounded claims. He has become a target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right_ who blame him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their rights_ even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying.  Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the deadly Jan. 6_ 2021_ insurrection.  Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6 committee_ including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger_ both Republicans_ as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the committee.  Biden_ an institutionalist_ has promised a smooth transition to the next administration_ inviting Trump to the White House and saying that the nation will be OK_ even as he warned during his farewell address of a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump’s ascension to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by those concerns.  Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the sentences of almost 2_500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row_ converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump_ an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment_ takes office. In his first term_ Trump presided over an unprecedented spate of executions_ 13_ in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.
281813994,Dear Readers: Wishing you all a very happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Inauguration Day!  I thought it would be a good time to find some impactful quotes from presidential inaugural speeches and from King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. I found quotes that inspire_ unify and motivate audiences toward a shared vision for the nation. Comparing King’s speech with specific inaugural addresses reveals common themes of leadership_ resilience and building an even better future for all of us.  “I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted_ every hill and mountain shall be made low_ the rough places will be made plain_ and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed_ and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith_ we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith_ we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith_ we will be able to work together_ to pray together_ to struggle together_ to go to jail together_ to climb up for freedom together_ knowing that we will be free one day.” -- Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech  “Let us_ then_ fellow citizens_ unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that_ having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered_ we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic_ as wicked_ and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.” -- Thomas Jefferson_ March 4_ 1801.  “With malice toward none_ with charity for all_ with firmness in the right_ as God gives us to see the right_ let us strive on to finish the work we are in_ to bind up the nation’s wounds.” -- Abraham Lincoln_ March 4_ 1865.  “Much has been given us_ and much will rightfully be expected from us. We have duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk neither.” -- Theodore Roosevelt_ March 4_ 1905.  “We have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world.” -- Herbert Hoover_ March 4_ 1929.  “This great nation will endure as it has endured_ will revive and will prosper. So_ first of all_ let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” -- Franklin D. Roosevelt_ March 4_ 1933.  “My fellow Americans: Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: Ask not what America will do for you_ but what together we can do for the freedom of man.” -- John F. Kennedy_ Jan. 20_ 1961.  “We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them_ reach out a hand when they fall_ heal them when they’re sick_ and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?” -- Ronald Reagan_ Jan. 20_ 1981.  “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.” -- Bill Clinton_ Jan. 20_ 1993.

282013776,Sen. John Fetterman arrived at the Capitol for President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration in a black hoodie_ gray shorts and sneakers — staying true to his traditional fashion style_ despite the freezing temp.  Everyone else has arrived in formal attire.  As dignitaries filed into the Capitol Rotunda_ the freshman senator from Pennsylvania was spotted luxuriating in the front row of the audience_ legs comfortably outstretched.  Fetterman met with Trump last week at Mar-a-Lago and has signaled openness to supporting a number of his administration staffing picks.  Fetterman has donned a proper suit in the past_ including when presiding over the Senate for votes_ in keeping with the upper chamber’s policies.   He’s also been seen wearing his tuxedo hoodie in the past_ including at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner last year.
282039110,By STEVE PEOPLES_ NICHOLAS RICCARDI and BILL BARROW  NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second inaugural address featured similar themes to his first: a sweeping indictment of the country he inherits and grand promises to fix its problems.  Eight years ago_ Trump described “American carnage” and promised to end it immediately. On Monday_ he declared that the country’s “decline” will end immediately_ ushering in “the golden age of America.”  Trump added a long list of policies that sounded more like a State of the Union speech than an Inauguration Day speech. But the broad themes were fundamentally Trumpian_ setting himself up as a national savior.  Breaking tradition_ the Republican president delivered his remarks from inside the Capitol Rotunda due to the bitter cold outside. He spoke to several hundred elected officials and pro-Trump VIPs_ tech titan Elon Musk among them.  Here are some takeaways from the speech:  A promise of an American ‘golden age’  From the start_ Trump’s speech tracked his campaign rally approach: big promises of national success due to his leadership_ with plenty of sweeping indictments of the status quo.  “The golden age of America begins right now_” Trump said after ticking through the requisite nods to former presidents and other dignitaries. He added several more hyperbolic but nebulous promises: The ”start of a thrilling new era.” A nation “greater_ stronger and far more exceptional than ever before.”  “Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced_” he continued. “Our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud_ prosperous and free.”  The underlying presumption_ of course_ is that Trump is inheriting what he called throughout the 2024 campaign “a failed nation.”  He vowed to fulfill campaign promises to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border_ boost domestic oil production and impose tariffs to “enrich our citizens.”  Trump calls America’s past leadership corrupt  Trump described America’s leadership over the last four years as incompetent and corrupt_ echoing some of the darker rhetoric he promoted on a daily basis as a presidential candidate on the campaign trail.  “We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home_ while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad_” Trump charged.  He said the current government protects dangerous immigrants instead of law-abiding citizens_ protects foreign borders at the expense of American borders and “can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency.”  And_ as he often does_ Trump cast him self as uniquely positioned to fix it all.  “All of this will change starting today_ and it will change very quickly_” he said.  As of Monday_ Republicans control all three branches of the federal government.  Recasting his assassination attempt  Trump mentioned the attempt to assassinate him in Butler_ Pennsylvania_ using striking language to describe how he survived.  “I was saved by God to make America great again_” Trump said to applause.  The shooter was an apparently disturbed 20-year-old local man. Trump baselessly implied the attack was part of a conspiracy to stop him from returning to office.  Lying about wildfires  Trump’s lament about the state of the nation included disbelief that the fires around Los Angeles were still burning “without a token defense.”  That’s false. Firefighters have been battling the blazes since they erupted and have made significant progress. The Eaton fire is 87% contained_ and the Palisades fire 59% contained_ according to CalFire.  A different scene indoors  Inaugural speeches are traditionally delivered on the National Mall in front of tens of thousands of cheering supporters_ many of them average voters from across America_ who traveled great distance to witness history in person.  Not this one.  Trump delivered his speech in front of a crowd estimated at only around 600 in the Capitol Rotunda_ which was limited to members of Congress_ Cabinet nominees_ Trump’s family_ business leaders and political VIPs. In fact_ a collection of tech titans_ led by Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos_ were positioned in front of Cabinet members in some cases. And while the business leaders were allowed to bring their spouses_ members of Congress were not. Thousands of his supporters watched a broadcast of the swearing-in at Capitol One Arena instead.  It’s noteworthy that four years ago_ violent Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol Rotunda as members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence feared for their lives. Pence attended Monday_ though his wife_ former second lady Karen Pence_ did not.  Riccardi reported from Denver_ and Barrow reported from Atlanta.
282169442,ATLANTA (AP) — Instead of crying over another collapse_ Ohio State can celebrate another national title after holding off a Notre Dame comeback bid Monday night to walk away with a nailbiter of a 34-23 victory over the Fighting Irish.  Will Howard hit big-play receiver Jeremiah Smith for 56 yards on a late third-and-11 to lock down a game that had been a laugher_ then turned into something else.  Trailing 31-7_ Notre Dame scored two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions to make it a one-score game late in the fourth quarter.  The Irish stopped Ohio State on the first two plays of the next drive and used their timeouts. But on third down_ Howard found Smith in single coverage on the right sideline and dropped his best pass of the season into the hands of the second-team All-American.  It set up a field goal that started the celebration in earnest_ closing out a seven-week climb from the depths of a loss to 20-point underdog Michigan to the top of college football. Ohio State will bring its sixth “natty” and first since the 2014 season back to the Horseshoe in Columbus.  Howard_ a transfer-portal success story from Kansas State_ threw for 231 yards and two scores_ but nothing will beat the pass to Smith with everything on the line.  The receiver_ who had been bottled up by Texas in the semifinals then fairly quiet for most of this game_ finally got loose for the kind of play he’s been making all year. He finished with five catches for 88 yards.  Ohio State scored touchdowns on its first four possessions_ then added a field goal on its fifth.  When Quinshon Judkins (100 yards_ 11 carries_ three TDs)_ a transfer from Mississippi who highlighted Ohio State’s judicious use of the ever-growing portal_ busted a 70-yard run to set up the score that made it 28-7_ this game looked over.  By Eddie Pells of the Associated Press.
282137928,Washington — President Trump on Monday granted clemency to roughly 1_500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes on Jan. 6_ 2021_ following through on his longtime promise to absolve those who participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol of wrongdoing.The president's action comes on his first day back in the White House and just hours after he was sworn in for a second term. Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the events of Jan. 6_ when a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming former President Biden's victory over him in 2020. And the pardons further his efforts to recast the assault as a "day of love" and Jan. 6 defendants as "political prisoners" and "hostages.""These are the hostages_ approximately 1_500 for a pardon_ full pardon_" Mr. Trump said during remarks from the Oval Office. "This is a big one."The president said he hopes those who remain incarcerated will be released tonight. His clemency includes six commutations_ he said_ though the proclamation released by the White House lists the names of 14 people and reduces their sentences to time served."These people have been destroyed_" he said. "What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in the history of our country."Mr. Trump lambasted the judges overseeing cases stemming from the Jan. 6 attack and the prosecutors who brought charges as "brutal."The proclamation signed by the president states that it "ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation."More than 1_600 people have been charged as a result of their alleged conduct on Jan. 6_ and at least 1_100 have had their cases adjudicated and received sentences_ according to the Justice Department. More than 700 defendants have completed their sentences or did not receive sentences of incarceration.More than 170 people have been accused of using a deadly or dangerous weapon_ such as a fire extinguisher or bear spray_ against police officers_ prosecutors have said.There are roughly 300 prosecutions that remain pending against defendants who have been charged_ the Justice Department said earlier this month. Nearly 60% of those have been charged with assaulting_ resisting_ or impeding law enforcement or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder_ which are felonies.Mr. Trump's proclamation directs the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments against those facing charges related to events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack. Many Jan. 6 defendants were charged with nonviolent misdemeanors_ though some faced more serious offenses_ like conspiring to use force to resist the transfer of power. But Mr. Trump's action appears to be sweeping — among those expected to receive clemency is Enrique Tarrio_ the former head of the far-right group the Proud Boys who was serving a 22-year sentence after he was convicted in May 2023 of charges including seditious conspiracy_ his lawyer Nayid Hassan told CBS News. It's unclear whether he will receive a pardon or have his sentence commuted. Mr. Trump suggested after he was inaugurated that he would offer reprieves to those convicted as a result of Jan. 6_ telling a crowd of supporters assembled at Emancipation Hall in the Capitol that they were "going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages."The pardons cap a remarkable sequence of events that has played out in the wake of the 2020 election_ when Mr. Trump mounted a scheme to overturn its results to hold onto power for a second term_ as alleged by federal prosecutors and House investigators.That plot culminated in the Jan. 6 attack_ as investigators said the president had spent weeks sowing doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election and urged his supporters in a speech outside the White House on Jan. 6 to "fight like hell" and "stop the steal."The Justice Department has said more than 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot at the Capitol. The losses suffered as a result of the riot_ including damage to the building and grounds_ exceeded $2.8 million_ according to the department. But four years after Mr. Trump allegedly attempted to subvert the transfer of power_ he has returned to the White House after defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris. In one of her final acts as vice president_ she presided over the joint session this year that confirmed Mr. Trump's victory.With Mr. Trump's repeated promise to grant a reprieve for those charged in connection with the Capitol attack_ several defendants sought to have court action in their cases delayed in the wake of the election_ though unsuccessfully for some. Others have been allowed by the judges overseeing their cases to attend Mr. Trump's inauguration in Washington.The authority to issue pardons for federal offenses rests exclusively with the president under the Constitution_ but presidents typically work with the Justice Department's pardon attorney to consider requests for clemency. It's unclear how Mr. Trump and his new administration decided who received pardons.Pam Bondi_ the president's pick for attorney general_ was asked during her confirmation hearing last week whether she believes Jan. 6 defendants who were convicted of assaulting law enforcement should be given clemency_ and said she would review each case and advise "on a case-by-case basis" if asked by the president to do so."I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country_" she said.Mr. Trump's decision is likely to stir anger from police officers who were injured during the Jan. 6 attack and testified before the House select committee that investigated the riot in 2022_ as well as committee members themselves_ some of whom are no longer in Congress.Meanwhile_ judges on the federal district court in Washington_ where the cases involving Jan. 6 have been brought_ have continued to resist efforts to lessen the severity of what transpired more than four years ago in the eyes of the public."No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending_ the true story of what happened on January 6_ 2021 will never change_" Senior Judge Royce Lamberth_ who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan_ said during a December sentencing. Lamberth said that "just as the president must make decisions on matters of clemency without interference from the coordinate branches_ so too must our judiciary independently administer the laws and sentence convicted offenders."Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked those who investigated the Jan. 6 assault and threatened to punish his political opponents_ including former special counsel Jack Smith and the lawmakers who were on the House select committee that investigated the attack.In anticipation of possible retribution by Mr. Trump_ Biden preemptively pardoned members of the Jan. 6 select committee and its staff_ as well as Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the panel_ during his final hours in office.
282137322,President Trump signed an executive order on Monday to delay enforcing a federal ban of TikTok for at least 75 days_ even though the law took effect on Sunday and it is unclear that such a move could override it.  The order_ one of Mr. Trump’s first acts after taking office_ instructs the attorney general not to take any action to enforce the law so that his administration has “an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.”   The order could immediately face legal challenges_ including over whether a president has the power to halt enforcement of a federal law. Companies subject to the law may determine that the order does not provide a shield from legal liability.  The federal law banning TikTok_ which is owned by China’s ByteDance_ mandated that the app needed to be sold to a non-Chinese owner or it would be blocked. The law allows a president to grant a 90-day extension if a buyer is found_ but only if there is “significant progress” on a deal that can be completed within that period. It is not clear that the extension is available_ given that the law is already in effect.
282241214,The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) late Monday night launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its new executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or hold temporary visas_ such as work_ student_ or tourist visas.President Donald Trump's order contradicts the Constitution_ which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States_ irrespective of their parents' immigration status.The ACLU lawsuit_ filed in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire_ was filed on behalf of clients whose babies born on U.S. soil will be denied citizenship under the order. This marks the first of many expected legal challenges Trump may face during his new second term following his early executive actions.The order_ signed by President Trump on Monday_ seeks to exclude children of non-permanent residents from automatically receiving U.S. citizenship. Although Trump made similar threats during his first term_ he did not implement them.What Can One Expect From The New OrderThe new executive order aims to reverse the 14th Amendment_ under which any person born within the territory of the U.S. is an American citizen.Under the new executive order_ babies born 30 days after the effective date will not be U.S. citizens if their mother was living undocumented or temporarily in the country and their father was not a U.S. citizen or resident. However_ babies born before the order and children with at least one U.S. citizen or resident parent will retain or be eligible for U.S. citizenship.The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution hasn't outlined strict policies on who can be a U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court has even specifically ruled that being born on U.S. soil alone makes you a U.S. citizen_ irrespective of your parents' immigration status.So_ arguments are running high that Trump's order is an outright violation of the 14th Amendment."Denying citizenship to U.S.-born children is not only unconstitutional — it's also a reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values. Birthright citizenship is part of what makes the United States the strong and dynamic nation that it is. This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history_ by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the U.S. who are denied full rights as Americans._" Anthony D. Romero_ executive director of the ACLU_ said in a statement."We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail."A Trump administration official hinted at potential limitations of the order_ stating that it would be applied on a "prospective basis_" meaning it will only affect people or situations that arise after the order is issued and will not affect people or situations that existed prior to its implementation.There has been a notable decline in the number of children born to parents in the U.S. without legal status.According to the Pew Research Center_ 1.3 million U.S.-born adults are children of unauthorized immigrants_ according to 2022 data_ the latest available.However_ immigrant rights advocates worry that Trump's new order could affect the next generation. By 2050_ an estimated 4.7 million children could have one or both parents without legal status under current policies_ according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.
282144592,President Trump is making good on his pre-election pledge to withdraw from the World Health Organization. In one of many orders issued after his inauguration_ he announced the start of the process for terminating U.S. membership in the U.N. agency that oversees global health issues.   Trump's frustration with WHO goes back to the height of the COVID era. He's repeatedly criticized the organization for being too slow to respond to the pandemic and being "owned and controlled by China."  "World Health ripped us off_" Trump said during an extended_ relaxed discussion with reporters as he signed executive actions.  It will take a year for Trump's pledge to become official. That's the time frame the U.S. set for any future withdrawal when it joined the global health body in 1948. In Trump's first term_ he halted funding to WHO and initiated the process of withdrawing. But before the one-year mark had been reached_ Biden took office and reversed course immediately.  The consequences of Monday's announcement for WHO are significant. They'd lose arguably their most important member — and their biggest donor by far. The U.S. gave $1.284 billion to WHO during 2022 and 2023 – hundreds of millions of dollars more than Germany_ the second-place donor.  Critics of Trump's call believe that the U.S. will also face consequences. WHO monitors global health threats_ evaluates new vaccines and medications_ coordinates the response to emerging health crises as well as ongoing issues and provides expert support to countries_ particularly when they face a health emergency – among other things. The U.S. would lose easy access to critical data on outbreaks and a seat at the table when health standards are set and disease responses are decided.  "This is the most cataclysmic decision_" says Lawrence Gostin_ professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of WHO's Center on Global Health Law. "[This is] a grave wound to American national interests and our national security. This will really leave our agencies – like the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and NIH [National Institutes of Health] flying blind."  Elisha Dunn-Georgiou — president and CEO of the Global Health Council_ a nonpartisan group that advocates for global health – said withdrawing is "really bad for the U.S. [in terms of] access to data_ to surveillance_ to being at the table negotiating and holding other countries accountable when there is an epidemic or pandemic."  Speaking to NPR last week about the prospect of withdrawal_ she said: "Other countries with a lot of power — China_ Russia — other powers that want to shape the WHO_ would take [this] opportunity to do so."  Brett Schaefer — a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation — said there are other ways the Trump Administration can lead in the global health arena after leaving WHO.  "There's hardly a lack of precedent for maybe addressing pandemic issues outside of the WHO_" he said_ speaking to NPR before the announcement was made. "There's a reason why UNAIDS exists_ and there's a reason why GAVI [The Vaccine Alliance] exists_ and there's a reason why the Global Fund exists — and that's because the WHO has_ in the past_ not been seen as either the most effective or the most responsive vehicle for addressing various international health concerns."
282395276,Garth Hudson_ the majestic keyboard_ saxophone and accordion player and last surviving member of The Band_ died Tuesday. He was 87.   Hudson died in his sleep at a nursing home in Woodstock_ New York_ his estate executor told The Toronto Star.   The Canadian musician and his mates Robbie Robertson_ Levon Helm_ Rick Danko and Richard Manuel backed up Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan before striking out on their own. They perfected a style that combined American roots music_ country_ blues_ R&B_ gospel_ rockabilly and — courtesy of Hudson — tenor sax and organ dirges.   One of many highlights of a Band concert was the bearded Hudson as mad genius performing an organ solo and a standard improvised introduction to “Chest Fever_” from their seminal 1968 debut album Music From Big Pink. The tune_ written by Robertson and echoing Bach with its classical overtones_ opened their Woodstock set in 1969.   “Where most rock organists 15 years ago were infusing their organ work with the razzle-dazzle of gospel_ Hudson cultivated a more pastoral sound_” Keyboard magazine wrote in 1983. “Unlike Billy Preston_ Felix Cavaliere_ Alan Price and in a different sense_ Ray Manzarek and Doug Ingle_ Hudson worked in the background_ letting the rhythm instruments and vocalists in The Band stand in the footlights while he spun his intricate musical webs so deeply into the fabric of each song that it was almost impossible to separately identify the keyboard parts at all.”   Eric Garth Hudson on born on Aug. 2_ 1937_ in Windsor_ Ontario. His parents_ former World War I fighter pilot Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland_ played instruments.   The family moved in 1940 to London_ Ontario_ and Hudson attended Broughdale Public School_ Medway High School and the University of Western Ontario. Along the way_ he studied classical piano and played the organ at St. Luke’s Anglican Church and at an uncle’s funeral parlor.   As rock ‘n’ roll was taking off in the late 1950s_ Hudson performed with dance bands and began a three-year stint as a member of Paul London & the Capers in 1958.   Robertson had already moved from his home in Toronto to Arkansas to hook up with Hawkins’ backup band_ and in his 2016 memoir_ Testimony_ he recalled pitching the rockabilly barnstormer on having Hudson come aboard.   “You remember Garth Hudson? Well_ I talked with him and besides being a really skillful musician_ he’s a fascinating and unusual guy_” Robertson wrote. “He mentioned this new gizmo that hooks up to a piano and sounds like an organ. It would make us sound twice as big.”   He also mentioned that Hudson played various saxophones. “Yeah_ to have an organ and horns_ that would be a big sound_” Hawkins said.   However_ it did take some convincing for Hudson_ then 24_ to leave his parents’ home. The clincher_ Robertson recalled_ was that Hudson got an additional $10 a week to give music lessons to his bandmates. (That assuaged his folks_ who feared their son was squandering his education.)   “Just having Garth as a teacher was an honor_” Helm wrote in his 1993 memoir_ This Wheel’s on Fire_ saying he learned a great deal about chord structures and harmonies from Hudson.   “He’d listen to a song on the radio in the Cadillac and tell us the chords as it went along_” Helm recounted. “Complicated chord structures? No problem. Garth would figure them out_ and we found ourselves able to play anything.”   From 1961-63_ the small-town Canadian kids and the Arkansas-born Helm played all over southern Ontario with Hawkins. Hudson brought along his Leslie speaker cabinet and a tricked-out Lowrey organ with wah-wah pedals.   After leaving Hawkins in early 1964_ the quintet_ now called Levon and the Hawks (and briefly the Canadian Squires)_ toured on their own across North America. Once_ they all got busted for possession of marijuana_ but only Danko was charged_ receiving a year on probation.   Hudson_ Robertson and Helm backed singer John Hammond on a 1965 album_ and in September of that year_ the Hawks auditioned for Dylan at Friar’s Tavern on Yonge Street in Toronto. They were with him when he shook up the folk world by switching to electric guitar on tours in 1965 and ’66.   During one stop at Toronto’s Massey Hall_ Dylan faced derision from folk music lovers in the audience_ and one local reviewer criticized Dylan for playing with a “third-rate Yonge Street band.”   “Only Garth seemed to understand why this was happening and chalked it up as a sign of the times_” Robertson wrote in his memoir as the rest of the band took the criticism personally.   “It was a job. Play a stadium_ play a theater_” Hudson told Maclean’s magazine in a 2002 profile. “My job was to provide arrangements with pads underneath_ pads and fills behind good poets. Same poems every night.”   In 1967_ the Hawks accompanied Dylan to his pink ranch house in Woodstock as he recuperated from a motorcycle accident. In the fall and winter of that year_ they collaborated on the bootleg recordings that would be known as The Basement Tapes.   “The typewriter would be there and Bob would tap on it for a while and then someone would go downstairs to check the equipment and then finally everyone would go down the pink stairs” to record more Dylan demos_ Hudson recalled in a 2014 documentary in which he returned to the “Big Pink” house and toured the cellar.   In 1968_ the five musicians became simply known as The Band and released Music From Big Pink_ which Rolling Stone in 2003 listed as No. 34 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.   During the next eight years_ they would record and release eight albums and hit songs including “The Weight_” “Up on Cripple Creek” and “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.”   The Band called it an era with a legendary final concert on Thanksgiving 1976 as captured in Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz (1978)_ but Hudson launched a solo career and reunited with Helm and Danko for a new album_ Jericho_ ultimately released in 1993_ followed by two more LPs.   He also contributed music to Scorsese’s The Raging Bull (1980) and to Philip Kaufman’s The Right Stuff (1983) and composed a 1980 score for a Los Angeles exhibit by sculptor Tony Duquette called Our Lady Queen of the Angels that became an album.   The Band was inducted into the Canadian Hall of Fame in 1989_ and in 1994_ with Hudson’s trademark bushy beard nearly all gray_ entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The humble organist used his address to name just about every musician he ever played with or was influenced by_ including the Gipsy Kings_ Leonard Cohen_ Van Morrison_ Muddy Waters_ Marianne Faithfull_ Roger Waters_ Jennifer Warnes_ Cyndi Lauper and Clifford Scott.

282152624,WASHINGTON (OSV News) — Among the first acts of his second term_ President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders including on immigration_ birthright citizenship and climate. Some Catholic organizations expressed concern about the scope of his orders and their potential impact on migrants.   In an event at Capital One Arena_ Trump signed a slew of executive orders in front of a crowd of his supporters. According to announcements from one of his aides_ Trump signed orders rescinding 78 of former President Joe Biden’s executive actions_ including one which created a task force to reunite families deliberately separated at the border. Another order suspended some U.S. refugee programs_ including one for Afghans cleared by the U.S. government to resettle in the U.S. due to threats by the Taliban after they aided the U.S.  Trump also signed an order withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate.  Once he reached the Oval Office_ Trump signed an executive order granting about 1_500 pardons for those charged in connection with the Jan. 6_ 2021_ riot at the U.S. Capitol — the day 2_000 supporters of then-President Donald Trump attempted to block Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory when he returned to the Oval Office later that evening. Trump indicated there might be additional commutations after “review.”   Trump also signed an executive order seeking to end the practice of birthright citizenship. The 14th Amendment states_ “All persons born or naturalized in the United States_ and subject to the jurisdiction thereof_ are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside_” but Trump told reporters in the Oval Office “we’re the only country in the world that does this.” The order will likely face legal challenges.   In his inaugural address just hours earlier_ Trump said he would sign a series of executive orders in the coming days_ including declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border_ shutting down “illegal entry_” and beginning “the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.” The White House said Trump would take “bold action to secure our border.”   While the specifics on how the White House may carry out a mass deportation program are not yet fully clear_ mass deportations more broadly run contrary to the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes” condemning “deportation” among other actions_ such as abortion_ that “poison human society” and give “supreme dishonor to the Creator_” a teaching St. John Paul II affirmed in two encyclicals on moral truth and life issues.  Executive orders are legally binding directives from the president and are published in the Federal Register. Conversely_ the term “executive actions” is broader and may include informal proposals for policy the president would like to see enacted. While it is typical for new presidents to issue some executive orders on their first day to signal certain priorities_ Trump signaled plans that were broader in scope. Some of his planned orders are expected to face legal challenges.  Chieko Noguchi_ executive director of public affairs for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops_ said in a statement the “conference will be carefully reviewing the executive orders that are expected to be signed today by President Trump.”   “The Catholic Church’s foundational teaching calls us to uphold the sacredness of human life and the God-given dignity of the human person. This means that the care for immigrants_ refugees_ and the poor is part of the same teaching of the Church that requires us to protect the most vulnerable among us_ especially unborn children_ the elderly and the infirm. The bishops’ conference will work with the Trump Administration as well as the U.S. Congress to advance the common good for all_ which will include instances of agreement_ as well as disagreement.”  Ronnate Asirwatham_ director of government relations for Network_ a Catholic social justice lobby_ said in a statement_ “In the coming days we will see an onslaught of Executive Orders_ proclamations_ and legislation that will attempt to criminalize our neighbors_ family members_ and friends_ we will not let our community be divided in this way.”   “From doctors to grocery store workers_ if our neighbors are ripped from our communities_ we will be grieving their loss_ absence_ gifts_ and contributions to our community and country_” Asirwatham said. “We refuse to stay silent as the state unnecessarily targets people_ all the while pursuing policies that benefit only the ultra-wealthy.”  Use of CBP One_ the mobile app run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to secure appointments needed to claim asylum and legally enter the United States_ was suspended as Trump’s term began.   Dylan Corbett_ executive director of the Hope Border Institute_ wrote in a post on X that while the app “wasn’t perfect_” it “contributed to a dramatic reduction in irregular border crossings and was the beginning of a safe_ orderly and rational way of managing migration at the border.”   “Demolishing it in a day will only make life more chaotic for Border Patrol and migrants_” he said.   The same evening_ the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to confirm Sen. Marco Rubio_ R-Fla._ as secretary of state on Monday_ making him the first confirmed member of Trump’s Cabinet in his second administration.  All 99 senators voted in favor of Rubio — including Rubio himself. The one vacancy in the Senate was due to Vice President JD Vance resigning from his Ohio seat earlier in January to take on his new role. Rubio subsequently resigned from the upper chamber as a result of his confirmation.   Kate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington. Follow her on X @kgscanlon.
282163834,The 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868_ after the close of the Civil War. The 13th Amendment had abolished slavery in 1865_ while the 14th settled the question of the citizenship of freed_ American-born former slaves.  Previous Supreme Court decisions_ like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857_ had decided that African Americans could never be US citizens. The 14th Amendment overrode that.  In 1898_ the US Supreme Court affirmed that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of Wong Kim Ark v United States.   Wong was a 24-year-old child of Chinese immigrants who was born in the US_ but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US_ his parents’ immigration status did not affect the application of the 14th Amendment.  “Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one’s parents_ all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered_” writes Erika Lee_ director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. “The court has not re-examined this issue since then.”

282514640,Four days ago_ the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban. Even before that decision was issued_ President Biden announced that he would not enforce the policy for the final 36 hours of his presidency. (In hindsight_ he may have been too busy signing pardons.) Yet_ for a short while_ TikTok went dark. And then TikTok turned on again_ in anticipation of Trump's inauguration. On his first day in office_ Trump signed an executive order concerning TikTok.  The order echoes President-Elect Trump's amicus brief. Trump asserts that the law impinges on his authority over national security:  I have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States_ the conduct of foreign policy_ and other vital executive functions. To fulfill those responsibilities_ I intend to consult with my advisors_ including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok_ and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans. My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date.  Like in the brief_ Trump refers to the timing of the statute as "unfortunate." This timing was no accident. Congress intended this decision to fall to President Biden.  The unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act — one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States — interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act's prohibitions before they take effect.  And Trump repeats his refrain that he can make a deal.  This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.  Trump directs his administration to take no action against anyone for seventy-five days.  Accordingly_ I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.  Trump doesn't quite say that the statute is unconstitutional. There is no basis_ then for an Article II override. Rather_ this seems to be purely an act of prosecutorial discretion. But it is more than that. Trump promises that no future penalties will be imposed on companies that work with TikTok.  Sec. 2. Action. (a) I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order_ to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok. During this period_ the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act_ including for distributing_ maintaining_ or updating (or enabling the distribution_ maintenance_ or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. In light of this direction_ even after the expiration of the above-specified period_ the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order_ including the period of time from January 19_ 2025_ to the signing of this order.  In theory at least_ the next administration could choose to bring an action within the statute of limitations. But that is unlikely. What makes this more unlikely is that the Attorney General must issue a non-enforcement letter:  (b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a). (c) I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period_ as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order.  I am fairly certain that these sorts of letters can be relied upon in the event of any future enforcement action. Alan Rozhenstein flags Zach Price's article about reliance on non-enforcement. Alan makes some fair points_ but as a matter of realpolitik_ I doubt there will ever be a prosecution. And that is enough for the lawyers at Oracle and Akami.  Apart from the estoppel argument_ I see here a fairly clear violation of the Take Care Clause. This is not simply an exercise in discretion. The President is authorizing the violation of a statute that was just upheld by the Supreme Court. And this order_ like others_ issues direct orders to the Attorney General about how to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Trump is making clear that he sees the Attorney General as his subordinate. I am inclined to agree with this view of Article II_ but it represents a departure from how past presidents have interacted with their Attorney Generals.  Finally_ the Attorney General can take steps to block enforcement of the ban by private parties or states.  (d) Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General_ attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive. The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive's exclusive authority to enforce the Act.  I'm a bit confused_ as I don't see any private causes of action under the statute.  As a coda to signing the order_ President Trump announced one possible deal:  The order_ one of Mr. Trump's first acts after taking office_ instructs the attorney general not to take any action to enforce the law so that his administration has "an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward." The order is retroactive to Sunday. As he signed the order_ Mr. Trump told reporters that "the U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok" if a deal for the app is reached_ without going into detail. He said he thought TikTok could be worth a trillion dollars. The order could immediately face legal challenges_ including over whether a president has the power to halt enforcement of a federal law. Companies subject to the law_ which forbids providing services to Chinese-owned TikTok_ may determine that the order does not provide a shield from legal liability.  Trump said: "If I do the deal for the United States_ I think we should get half."  After Trump filed his brief_ I wrote:  After nearly a decade_ I think people still do not understand Trump. He doesn't play like everyone else does_ and that is what infuriates people. When he says something that people deem outlandish_ it is merely an opening bid_ not the final offer. I think he views this case like he views just about everything else--as a deal to be made.  All his proceeding are going to plan.
282514638,President Donald Trump_ fulfilling a promise made at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in May_ pardoned Ross Ulbricht today. Ulbricht had been serving a life sentence for his role in founding and operating the dark web marketplace Silk Road.  As Trump put it in a Truth Social post: "in honor of [his mother Lyn Ulbricht]_ and the Libertarian Movement_ which supported me so strongly_ it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son_ Ross." He said "the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me."  As I reported on his sentencing in May 2015 (he has been in prison since his October 2013 arrest):  Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison with no parole…by Judge Katherine Forrest in U.S. District Court for the southern district of New York. Ulbricht was convicted back in February on seven charges_ all related to the operation of the darkwebsite called Silk Road_ which used Tor-enabled anonymity and the cryptocurrency bitcoin to allow people to buy and sell often illegal items in safety and security_ with the site providing an escrow service between buyer and seller to ensure both were satisfied. Ulbricht was a clever entrepreneur_ enthralled by libertarian ideas derived from the likes of Murray Rothbard and Samuel Konkin about the richness and justice of truly free markets not hobbled by government threats. The charges were: "narcotics trafficking; distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet; narcotics trafficking conspiracy; continuing criminal enterprise; conspiracy to aid and abet computer hacking; conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identity documents; and money laundering conspiracy." None of the charges were related to either personally selling an illegal substance to anyone—Ulbricht merely ran a website that facilitated it—and none were related to causing direct harm to anyone's life or property. Given the amazing water-muddying the prosecution achieved by talking about_ but never trying Ulbricht for or proving in court beyond a reasonable doubt_ allegedly planned_ but never executed_ murders for hire_ one wonders whether the judge allowed any thoughts of those rumors_ even subconsciously_ to shape her sentencing decision.  Silk Road's innovative mail order using bitcoin_ combined with user reviews of sellers_ imposed some real market discipline on dealers_ kept buyers from the occasional dangers of physically obtaining drugs_ and allowed people not violating others' lives and property to buy and sell drugs with less (but not zero) legal risk.  Because of all that_ and the site's role in publicizing and popularizing the use of bitcoin as currency_ Ulbricht was considered a martyr of sorts to many in the libertarian and bitcoin communities.  Trump's promise_ out of character for a man who otherwise advocates the death penalty for drug dealing_ was widely seen as an attempt to appeal to those parts of the larger anti-establishment coalition he put together on his way to his return to the White House.  Ulbricht has expressed regret and his intention to be a law-abiding citizen_ and there is certainly little reason to think he'd ever represent any danger to others on release. Reason's Nick Gillespie and Jacob Sullum have_ in the past week_ provided detailed discussions about why letting Ulbricht out after serving 11 years is proper and just.  As I wrote upon his sentencing_ Ulbricht need not "worry about redemption per se. Ulbricht and Silk Road….sent out a more powerful message than the one the government wanted Judge [Katherine] Forrest to send: that ingenuity and technology and effort can create wonderfully helpful realms of freedom in markets and behavior."  The Libertarian Party Connection  Despite facing criticism for her support of Trump—and for the L.P.'s falling fortunes in membership_ money_ and candidates—Angela McArdle_ chair of the Libertarian National Committee_ argued for Libertarian support for Trump in large part based on his promise of Ulbricht's release_ or at least because he was the type of major party candidate who would release him. While she has at different times intimated that her cooperation with Trump induced him to make the promise_ and also that_ as she told Tom Woods on his podcast in June 2024_ Trump in fact already signed a pardon for Ulbricht in 2020 but was somehow foiled by underlings_ the pardon does indicate that Trump considers a libertarian constituency one he is behooved to do favors for_ which is an encouraging sign that he can feel pressured to sometimes do the right thing in libertarian terms.  While many doubted Trump would come through_ Ulbricht himself seemed confident it would happen_ as he expressed in a November post-election X post. McArdle also insisted in a November interview with Reason's Robby Soave on The Hill's Rising program that she'd arranged meetings between Trump's people and Ulbricht's family about the matter. McArdle repeated her confidence that Trump would make good on his vow last week.  One just favor for libertarians does not a libertarian administration make_ especially not one so dedicated to hobbling free trade_ punishing the press_ rounding up peaceful immigrants_ and pursuing autarkist nationalist industrial policy. But Trump's coming through on this promise makes a huge difference for one man who did not deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison_ and deserves justified applause.

282816930,The Jets are bringing back one of their own.  The team hired Aaron Glenn to be their 19th head coach on Tuesday. Glenn_ who was the team’s first-round draft choice in 1994 and played eight seasons for the Jets_ spent the past four years as the Lions defensive coordinator.  The Jets zeroed in on Glenn during an extensive search for a head coaching candidate that saw them interview 16 different people. Glenn_ 52_ emerged as the favorite to get the job after Mike Vrabel decided to take the Patriots job.  Glenn interviewed for a second time with the Jets on Tuesday in Florham Park. He interviewed virtually with the team on Jan. 9.  Lance Newmark_ who knows Glenn from three years together in Detroit_ interviewed for the general manager job for a second time on Tuesday.  Newmark spent 26 seasons in Detroit before going to the Commanders last year where he was the assistant general manager under Adam Peters.  Newmark had a virtual interview with the Jets on Jan. 11_ two days after Glenn interviewed for the job. That could be a sign that he was recommended by Glenn. It would make sense for the Jets to try to pair two men who have a previous working relationship in the jobs.  Glenn’s defenses in Detroit ranked 29th_ 32nd_ 19th and 20th in yards allowed per game and 31st_ 28th_ 23rd and 7th in points allowed. The Lions went 15-2 this season and were the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs despite losing a number of defensive players to injury. The Lions were upset by the Commanders 45-31 on Saturday.  The Jets are not hiring Glenn just for his defensive acumen_ though. Glenn is known as a tough coach who is popular with players but also is not shy when holding them accountable. The Jets entered this coaching search prioritizing leadership over everything else.  The biggest question about Glenn now will be who he hires as his offensive coordinator. Glenn said last week that he does not view himself as just a defensive coach.  “Here’s the one thing that I will say about myself_ I’m a coach_ I just happen to be on defense_” Glenn said. “I understand the offense just as well as a number of people_ so if you want to hire me_ you’re going to hire a coach_ you’re not going to hire a defensive coach. I’m going to talk to the offense just as much as I’m going to talk to the defense.”  The Lions’ surprising loss to Washington accelerated the hiring process. If the Lions had won_ the Jets would have been unable to interview Glenn in person until next week.  Glenn was scheduled to interview a second time with the Saints on Wednesday but the Jets made sure that did not happen. Glenn also interviewed with the Jaguars_ Raiders and Bears during this hiring cycle.  Glenn began his post-playing career as a scout with the Jets in 2012-13. He then worked as a coach for the Browns and Saints before taking the Lions job under head coach Dan Campbell in 2021.  The Jets are coming off a disappointing 5-12 season that began with high expectations. Jets owner Woody Johnson fired coach Robert Saleh after a 2-3 start but the move did not change the direction of the team. He fired GM Joe Douglas six weeks later.  Glenn and the new GM will have to decide whether to bring back quarterback Aaron Rodgers_ who remains under contract but did not produce the results people expected last season.  There is also a question about whether to bring back wide receiver Davante Adams_ who was acquired by trade in the middle of the season.  The answers to those questions will get cleared up in the coming weeks. For now_ the Jets have found their new leader and it is a familiar face.

282511436,A German man on a legal visa is accused of killing a United States Border Agent during a traffic stop in Vermont near the Northern border_ according to Fox News Digital.  According to FBI Albany_ the deceased suspect is confirmed to be a German national with a valid visa in the U.S.  The incident took place on Monday_ Jan. 20_ when 44-year-old U.S. Border Patrol Agent David “Chris” Maland was shot during a traffic stop on Interstate 91 between Newport and Orleans_ Vermont.  In a statement_ FBI Albany said that Maland was a U.S. Air Force veteran_ saying: “We are heartbroken for our partners and share in their grief as they mourn the loss of their colleague.”  “FBI Albany has numerous resources in the area_ to include our Evidence Response Team (ERT)_ Victim Services_ Digital Forensics_ and dozens of Special Agents_” they said.  On Monday night_ authorities were seen using a robotic device to inspect a backpack near what appeared to be a body on the ground at the scene.  The Border Patrol Union shared its condolences_ saying on X_ “Our hearts and prayers go out to the family_ friends_ and coworkers of our fallen brother in green in Vermont.”   Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)_ Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.)_ and Rep. Becca Balint (Vt.-AL) shared their condolences with the family.  “Border Patrol agents do important work protecting our borders. They deserve our full support in terms of staffing_ pay and working conditions_” the elected officials shared in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to working with the agency to make sure that they have all the resources they need to do the enormously important work that is their responsibility. Together_ we must do everything possible to prevent future tragedies like what happened today.”  The shooting came just hours after President Donald Trump was inaugurated to a second term. He campaigned heavily on securing the border and defending law enforcement.
282721010,By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and ERIC TUCKER_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is directing its federal prosecutors to investigate any state or local officials who stand in the way of beefed-up enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration_ according to a memo to the entire workforce obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday.  Written by Emil Bove_ the acting deputy attorney general_ the memo also says the department will return to the principle of charging defendants with the most serious crime it can prove_ a staple position of Republican-led departments meant to remove a prosecutor’s discretion to charge a lower-level offense.  Much of the memo is centered on immigration enforcement. Bove wrote that prosecutors shall “take all steps necessary to protect the public and secure the American border by removing illegal aliens from the country and prosecuting illegal aliens for crimes” committed in U.S. jurisdiction.  The memo also suggests state and local officials who stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement could themselves come under scrutiny. It directs prosecutors to investigate any episodes in which state and local officials obstruct or impede federal functions.  “Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting_ obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests_” the memo says. “The U.S. Attorney’s Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution.”  The three-page memo signals an immediate and sharp turnabout in priorities from President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration_ with prosecutors told in no uncertain terms that they will be on the front lines of an administration-wide effort to crack down on illegal immigration and border crime and that they are expected to carry out the policy vision of President Donald Trump’s Republican White House when it comes to violent crimes_ the threat of transnational gangs and drug trafficking.  “Indeed_ it is the responsibility of the Justice Department to defend the Constitution_ and accordingly_ to lawfully execute the policies that the American people elected President Trump to implement_” Bove wrote in the memo obtained by the AP.  “The Justice Department’s responsibility_ proudly shouldered by each of its employees_ includes aggressive enforcement of laws enacted by Congress_ as well as vigorous defense of the President’s actions on behalf of the United States against legal challenges_” Bove added. “The Department’s personnel must come together in the offices that taxpayers have funded to do this important work.”

People who feel seen and heard have reduced feelings of isolation and increased resilience_ which lends the confidence to step forward with purpose and clarity.   CANCER (June 22-July 22). While others brag and call attention to themselves_ you will stay quiet and let your work speak for itself. Not everyone understands your work_ which is good. It tells you where to focus the best of your energy_ which is to say on the ones who do.  LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). What do knowledge_ topical medicine and skincare products have in common? All must be absorbed to work for you. If there’s a protective layer or anything causing resistance_ it needs to be removed before anything else will soak in.  VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). The golden rule of “do unto others” is delightful only if they want the same things you want. If that is not the case_ no gold comes of the rule. Those who listen to and supply what the others want will be rewarded.   LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). You’re building something extraordinary -- not just with your projects but in the way you’re crafting a life that feels right and warm. Trust that even in the less ideal moments_ you’re still moving toward your best self. Your strength outweighs your doubts.   SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Let love grow by letting love go. You’ve demonstrated your intent. You’ve listened and learned. You’ve done enough to get to know and be known by the other person. Now step back and trust the hand of fate.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You’ll leverage a special friendship to tick off an item on your wish list. Getting what you want will have a ripple effect_ and others will get what they want_ too. Your presence just might start a scene.   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). What’s chased will run. This is why you don’t chase and instead focus on building attraction. It has you ignoring what you’re bad at and maximizing your gifts. With a focus on strengths_ weaknesses become a moot point.   TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 22). Self-awareness and accountability will ring through your triumphs and shape your personal_ professional and financial gains. Even so_ what you’re conscious of is only a small portion of the story. Unconscious desire manifests into magic. More highlights: a mind-blowing coincidence_ adoration from afar_ and critical acclaim for the tremendous beauty you create. Gemini and Scorpio adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 3_ 22_ 1_ 5 and 15.  CELEBRITY PROFILES: Ten-year-old Guy Fieri opened a pretzel cart and never looked back.

282973116,LONDON (AP) — A violence-obsessed teenager is facing decades in prison when he is sentenced for stabbing three young girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed summer dance class.  Axel Rudakubana_ 18_ faces a sentencing hearing Thursday at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England over the July 29 attack_ which devastated the seaside town of Southport_ shocked the country and set off both street violence and soul-searching.  The crime triggered anti-immigrant rioting and has led the government to reconsider its definition of terrorism_ its approach to online radicalization and the way information about criminal suspects is made public.  Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder_ 10 of attempted murder for those he injured_ and additional charges of possessing a knife_ the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on all charges on Monday – sparing victims’ families a lengthy trial_ but also potentially robbing them of answers.  Prosecutors plan to set out their case against Rudakubana in detail during Thursday’s hearing_ with relatives of the victims watching in court.  The attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when two dozen little girls were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana_ armed with a knife_ intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher.  He killed Alice Da Silva Aguiar_ 9_ Elsie Dot Stancombe_ 7_ and Bebe King_ 6. Eight other girls_ ranging in age from 7 to 13_ were wounded_ along with instructor Leanne Lucas and John Hayes_ who worked in a business next door and intervened.  The killings in the northwest England town triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K. Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack_ and alleged that police and the government were withholding information.  Rudakubana was born in Cardiff_ Wales to Christian parents from Rwanda_ and investigators have not been able to pin down his motivation.  In the years before the attack he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told lawmakers on Tuesday that Rudakubana “was convicted of a violent assault against another child at school” and had multiple contacts with children’s social care_ mental health services and police_ who were called to his home over his behavior five times between 2019 and 2022. He was referred three times to the government’s anti-extremism program_ Prevent_ when he was 13 and 14.  All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed.  The government has declared the case a wake-up call. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it must lead to “fundamental change” in the way the state protects its citizens_ announcing a public inquiry into the failures that allowed Rudakubana to carry out his rampage with a knife he had ordered from Amazon.  He said laws might need updating to combat a “new threat” from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism_ “acts of extreme violence carried out by loners_ misfits_ young men in their bedrooms.”  The Crown Prosecution Service has defended the decision not to disclose details before Rudakubana went to court_ saying “releasing that information earlier would have put the trial at risk.” U.K. contempt of court laws limit what can be reported before trial_ in the interests of preventing jury bias.

Windows Central reports the mysterious unannounced game is "a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history_" which certainly sounds intriguing.

Xbox spent most of 2024 adjusting its strategy around releasing games_ delaying some titles to this year_ and bringing some formerly exclusive games to the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. The company seems like it's favoring timed exclusives over hoarding everything for Xbox and PC_ so the job of this Developer Direct is a little bit different this time. Besides letting developers sell their games_ the real test of the show is if it can get you excited about games that are coming to Xbox first_ rather than only coming to Xbox at all.  You can watch the Xbox Developer Direct showcase on YouTube_ Twitch_ or right here in the embed above when it starts at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.

283593066,Marilyn Manson will not be criminally charged for domestic violence and sexual assault following a four-year investigation_ the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office announced in a press release Friday.  LA District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman said “experienced prosecutors from the Sex Crimes Division of the District Attorney’s Office_ along with detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department” came to the decision following a “comprehensive” probe into the shock rocker.  “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations_ and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt_” he added.   Hochman then went on to praise the women who had come forward for their “courage and resilience.”  “While we are unable to bring charges in this matter_ we recognize that the strong advocacy of the women involved has helped bring greater awareness to the challenges faced by survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault_” he said.   “Due to their efforts_ victims of domestic violence have a greater voice in our criminal justice system and prosecutorial offices around the country have improved tools to hold domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions.”  Hochman concluded that his office remains “committed” to “seeking justice for survivors.”  Page Six has reached out to reps for Manson on the decision but did not immediately hear back.  The “Beautiful People” singer has also not commented on the matter on social media yet. However_ he took to his Instagram Stories on Friday to promote his upcoming North American tour dates.  In February 2021_ Manson’s ex Evan Rachel Wood accused him of grooming her when she was just a teenager and abusing her throughout their relationship.   “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission_” she wrote via Instagram at the time.  “I am done living in fear of retaliation_ slander_ or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him_ before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.”  Her remarks prompted others to come forward_ including model Sarah McNeilly who alleged Manson locked her in rooms when she was “bad” and forced her to listen to him entertaining other women — leaving her “emotionally abused_ terrorized and scarred.”   “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco also alleged the “Tainted Love” singer had abused her_ which the rocker’s lawyers previously said were claims that were “provably false.”  However_ TMZ learned at the time that both the FBI and local law enforcement in Los Angeles were looking to meet with Manson’s accusers as an initial examination into whether a crime had been committed which warranted further investigation.  In November 2021_ police conducted a search at the “Sweet Dream” rocker’s home as part of their ongoing probe into the sexual assault claims.  Manson_ whose real name is Brian Warner_ has maintained his innocence and even sued Wood_ 37_ for defamation — but dropped that lawsuit this past November.  This is not the first time the goth rocker has been able to escape charges from the LA DA.   According to Variety_ the office said in 2018 that the charges leveled against Manson seven years prior in 2011 had been dismissed due to an expiration on the statute of limitations on two charges and an absence of corroboration for a sexual assault claim.
283376044,Martin Luther King Jr’s family offered their response to President Donald Trump’s decision to release the secret FBI files on the civil rights icon’s assassination nearly 60 years ago — a “deeply personal family loss” that they are still feeling today.  On Thursday Trump signed an executive order to release the files connected to the deaths of King_ former President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy.  “For us_ the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release_” the family said.   Trump said “everything will be revealed” while signing the executive order in the Oval Office.  The order called the release of the files “long overdue” and requires the Department of Justice and Office of the Director of National Intelligence to rapidly prepare for the release.  King was shot and killed by James Earl Ray on the evening of April 4_ 1968_ as he stood on a second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis_ Tenn.  King’s family has continued to work towards a comprehensive investigation into the assassination_ emphasizing the importance of uncovering the truth while also focusing on preserving the icon’s legacy_ Fox Atlanta reported.   The fatal shooting came after the FBI worked to undermine the minister’s anti-racial discrimination advocacy.  An anonymous letter from the agency to King was believed to be an attempt to get the civil rights leader to commit suicide.  An analysis from the FBI 23 days before the assassination claimed King’s inner circle had an inordinate number of Communists.  The analysis noted that two of King’s former aides were Communist Party members_ while eight others had communist affiliations.   The document claimed the party had attempted to form a black labor coalition to spread its goals across the US_ arguing King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference were “made to order” for the communist mission.  A black minister had attended a minister training workshop hosted by King in February 1968 and “expressed his disgust with the behind-the-scene [sic] drinking_ fornication and homosexuality that went on at the conference_” the analysis stated.   “Throughout the ensuing years and until this date_” the FBI analysis said_ “King has continued to carry on his sexual aberrations secretly while holding himself out to public view as a moral leader of religious conviction.”  King was arrested several times throughout his career_ with former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover considering him a radical.  President Kennedy’s grandson reacted to the news of the executive order_ claiming Trump was doing it for political reasons   “Declassification is using JFK as a political prop_ when he’s not here to punch back_” Jack Schlossberg said. “There’s nothing heroic about it.”

The lawsuit including Montag and other Pacific Palisades residents was filed Tuesday. (Photo by ... [+] Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP_ File) 2019 Invision  The lawsuit blamed the city and the utility’s management of its water supply and emergency response infrastructure for causing damage to properties of Montag_ Pratt and 20 other “owners_ tenants and individuals” impacted by the Palisades Fire_ according to the Times.  The suit specifically alleges inverse condemnation_ a concept used by property owners who claim a government entity has taken an action resulting in damage to the property—the concept also seeks just compensation.  Lawyers for Montag and other claimants pointed out the Santa Ynez Reservoir_ a reservoir near the Palisades that was offline and empty for repairs while the Palisades Fire ignited and spread.  The complaint scrutinized the local water supply system further_ according to the Times_ claiming LADWP made ​​“the conscious decision to operate the water supply system with the reservoir drained and unusable as a ‘cost-saving’ measure.”  Montag and Pratt announced on Jan. 8 the Palisades Fire destroyed their home_ which was valued around $3.8 million as of this month.  The LAWDP did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.

The Times noted experts have said the municipal water systems in place in the Palisades were not equipped for the strength of the Palisades Fire_ which was made significantly worse by extremely strong winds that stopped first responders from safely operating water-dumping helicopters and planes in the early stages of the fire.  Crucial Quote  “On information and belief_ the Palisades Fire was an inescapable and unavoidable consequence of the water supply system servicing areas in and around Pacific Palisades as it was planned and constructed_” the lawsuit reportedly said. “The system necessarily failed_ and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this Complaint.”  What Other Celebrities Lost Their Homes In The Palisades Fire?  Actors such as Miles Teller_ John C. Reilly and Mel GIbson lost their homes in the blaze_ while other public figures like comedian Pete Lee_ "Shark Tank" investor Barbara Corcoran and Paris Hilton also had their homes destroyed.

Unfortunately_ CRIME was not the answer (is it ever?) but with only one word remaining_ I finally snagged CREPE for the win.

283292564,WASHINGTON (OSV News) — President Donald Trump on Jan. 23 signed an executive order directing the declassification of files on the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy_ the nation’s first Catholic president_ his brother Sen. Robert Kennedy_ and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr._ the famed Civil Rights era leader.  Rev. King led the nation’s fight for civil rights before he was gunned down in Memphis_ Tennessee_ April 4_ 1968. Upon King’s death_ RFK gave an impassioned speech in Indianapolis for racial unity following Rev. King’s non-violent witness_ which is widely regarded as having calmed tensions in the city. But within two months_ RFK himself was struck down.  Each of those three killings took place within a span of five years during the 1960s. They were each carried out by lone gunmen according to public record. But the remainder of still-classified documents in the decades-old cases have been the subject of conspiracy theories and public interest.  “More than 50 years after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy_ Senator Robert F. Kennedy_ and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King_ Jr._ the Federal Government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events_” Trump’s executive order states. “Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay.”  Congress mandated in 1992 that all JFK assassination documents were to be released within 25 years; but multiple presidents_ including Trump_ authorized delays.  Trump previously pledged to declassify the documents in his first term_ but did not follow through at that time amid intelligence community concern.  “That’s a big one_” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed the executive order. “Lot of people are waiting for this for a long_ long time_ for years_ for decades_ and everything will be revealed.”  Trump then directed an aide to give the pen he used to do so to Robert F. Kennedy Jr._ nephew to the late president and RFK’s son. The late senator served as JFK’s attorney general_ and was mounting his own bid for the presidency when he was killed by Sirhan Sirhan in June 1968.  RFK Jr. is Trump’s pick for secretary of Health and Human Services. He faces a contentious confirmation battle in the Senate in part due to his controversial views on vaccines and has long sought the release of the documents related to the assassinations of his father and his uncle.  Robert Schmuhl_ professor emeritus of American studies at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana_ who critically observes the modern American presidency_ told OSV News_ “assassinations always breed conspiracy theories and unanswered questions.”  “If declassifying and releasing additional documents bring an end to unfounded speculation_ the actions are in the public interest_” he said.  JFK faced anti-Catholic prejudice while campaigning to become the first Catholic to hold the nation’s highest office. His presidential library noted Gov. Al Smith of New York_ a Catholic Democrat like JFK_ failed in his 1928 election bid as he was “dogged by claims that he would build a tunnel connecting the White House and the Vatican.” JFK used his rhetorical gifts to tackle the issue head-on_ persuading Protestant Americans that they had nothing to fear from a Catholic serving as president of the United States.  In a shock to the nation_ JFK was assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22_ 1963_ while preparing to run for a second term. Police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald in connection with the killing. Oswald was himself shot to death two days later while being transferred in police custody.  “How John Kennedy died has often overshadowed what he did and meant_” Schmuhl said. “America and the world deserve to learn as much as possible about the verifiable details of what happened. Secrecy serves no purpose in this regard.”  Kate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington. Follow her on X @kgscanlon.
283345920,Ten-time champion Novak Djokovic has sensationally withdrawn from the Australian Open after losing a marathon first set of his semi-final against second seed Alexander Zverev.  Djokovic walked immediately to the chair umpire to say he could not go on after dropping the set in a tiebreaker after one hour and 21 minutes on Jan. 24  The former world No.1 again had his left thigh heavily strapped after hurting himself in his quarter-final win over Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday night.  Djokovic said then he would likely have to skip routine practice before playing Zverev_ but declined to reveal the exact details of his injury.  The 37-year-old did_ however_ say it was similar to the hamstring injury he nursed while winning his 10th Open title two years ago.  Zverev’s victory_ which came when Djokovic quit after losing the tiebreaker 7-5_ propelled the 27-year-old German into his maiden Australian Open final_ and the third grand slam title match of his career.  The world No.2 lost the 2020 US Open final to Dominic Thiem as well as last year’s French Open decider to Alcaraz.  Djokovic had been bidding to win an unprecedented 25th grand slam singles crown at Melbourne Park_ having been level with Margaret Court on 24 since the 2023 US Open.  Zverev will play the winner of Friday night’s second semi-final between Italy’s top-ranked titleholder Jannik Sinner and American world No.20 Ben Shelton.  The German offered his sympathy to Djokovic and urged the Rod Laver Arena crowd to show respect towards the living legend.  “I know that everybody paid for tickets and everybody wants to see hopefully a great five-set match and everything but you’ve got to understand_” Zverev said.  “Novak Djokovic is somebody who has given this sport for the past 20 years absolute everything of his life.  “He has won this tournament with an abdominal tear. He has won this tournament with a hamstring tear. If he cannot continue a tennis match_ it really means he cannot continue a tennis match.  “So_ please be respectful and really_ really show some love for Novak as well.”  Djokovic said he may have played on had he won the first set_ but conceded he could not have carried on for four or five hours.  “I actually thought it was quite a high-level first set_” Zverev said.  “But_ I mean like_ of course_ there are some difficulties and the longer you continue playing then maybe the worse it gets.  “In the tiebreak_ maybe he was not moving as well as in the entire first set but I thought we had extremely long rallies_ extremely difficult_ physical also rallies.  “In the tiebreak_ I did see him struggle maybe a bit more.”
283439984,The defendants in that case were charged with two federal offenses: conspiring against civil rights and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act_ for the parts they played in blocking the entrance to that clinic. That law makes it a crime to threaten_ obstruct or injure a person seeking access to a reproductive health clinic or to damage clinic property.  One of the anti-abortion activists_ Lauren Handy_ was sentenced to nearly five years in prison last year for her role in leading the blockade. Her case drew widespread attention when the police said that they had found five fetuses in her home shortly after she was charged in the case. Other defendants received sentences of less than three years in prison. One defendant_ Jay Smith_ 34_ of Freeport_ New York_ pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison.
283675534,Pete Hegseth_ a former Fox News host_ has been confirmed as the next United States secretary of defense_ receiving the keys to the nation's largest federal agency.   After a tense Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 14_ a number of Republicans who previously expressed doubts about Hegseth's nomination declared that they would fall in line behind President Donald Trump's preferred candidate.   The Senate Armed Services Committee_ which helped vet Hegseth_ recommended on Jan. 20 that he be confirmed by the full Senate_ and on Friday_ Jan. 24_ the Senate heeded the committee's advice by voting 51-50 to approve his nomination.   Vice President J.D. Vance needed to place a tie-breaking vote after Republican Senators Mitch McConnell_ Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination.   Hegseth was considered one of Trump's riskiest nominations_ making his confirmation a major feat for the administration. Three other controversial nominees will be put to the test next: Robert F. Kennedy Jr._ nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services; Tulsi Gabbard_ nominated for director of national intelligence; and Kash Patel_ nominated for FBI director.   Prior to Hegseth's confirmation vote_ Murkowski and Collins revealed that they would oppose his nomination to oversee the Pentagon and all U.S. Armed Forces_ each writing lengthy statements that explained their similar_ myriad reasons for voting against him — including mentions of his many controversies_ thin résumé_ and previous comments he's made about how women do not belong in combat roles.   "He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views_" Collins wrote on X. "I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed."   From Murkowski's X statement: "Above all_ I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense_ and must be prioritized without compromise. The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers_ and Mr. Hegseth’s nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook."   Hegseth's nomination on Nov. 13_ 2024_ was quickly tainted by a resurfaced sexual assault allegation from 2017.   According to a police report_ his accuser alleged that the former Fox News host had sexually assaulted her at the 2017 California Federation of Republican Women biennial conference — where Hegseth was the keynote speaker and the woman was an organizer.   Hegseth was never charged in connection to the incident. However_ he entered into a settlement agreement with the woman_ which included monetary compensation and a confidentiality clause_ per CNN.   On Jan. 23_ The Associated Press reported that the settlement payment amounted to $50_000.   When the police report resurfaced_ Hegseth's attorney_ Timothy Parlatore_ told CNN: “This police report confirms what I’ve said all along_ that the incident was fully investigated_ and police found the allegations to be false_ which is why no charges were filed."   Trump's transition team expressed similar sentiments one day later_ claiming police found the allegations to be false — though authorities only concluded that they did not have enough evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   During his Senate confirmation hearing_ Hegseth denied the allegations and said they were "anonymous_ false charges.”   The scandal involving Hegseth grew when The New York Times obtained a 2018 email from Penelope Hegseth_ the Fox News host's mother. In the correspondence_ she called him "despicable" and "an abuser of women_" though she told the outlet she rescinded her thoughts to her son one day later.   The New Yorker then reported on Dec. 1 that Hegseth was allegedly ousted from previous nonprofit leadership positions due to mismanagement of funds_ repeated drunkenness and misconduct with women.   Hegseth downplayed the claims as part of a coordinated smear campaign during his confirmation hearing and vowed that he would not drink if he was confirmed.   Many Republicans withheld their support for Hegseth amid the controversies_ though Trump maintained outward confidence that his nominee still had a path to getting confirmed.   On Jan. 21_ before the Senate took Hegseth's confirmation to a vote_ his former sister-in-law came forward with new allegations against him_ claiming in an affidavit submitted to the Senate that his second wife_ Samantha_ feared for her safety and made escape plans_ allegedly going so far as to develop a code word that she could use to get help.   Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed_ the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee_ told NBC News in a statement_ “As I have said for months_ the reports of Mr. Hegseth’s history of alleged sexual assault_ alcohol abuse_ and public misconduct necessitate an exhaustive background investigation. I have been concerned that the background check process has been inadequate_ and this sworn affidavit confirms that fact."   Reed added that “the alleged pattern of abuse and misconduct by Mr. Hegseth is disturbing. This behavior would disqualify any service member from holding any leadership position in the military_ much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense.”   Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.   In an email to NBC News_ Samantha asserted that there was no physical abuse in her marriage.   Hegseth's lawyer also responded to the latest allegations: "Sam has never alleged that there was any abuse_ she signed court documents acknowledging that there was no abuse and recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview."
283772082,TEL AVIV — Four Israeli female soldiers were released by Hamas in Gaza City on Saturday morning_ marking the start of a second week of a protracted ceasefire and hostage release deal that has halted 15 months of fighting and delivered Hamas a new platform to project optics of power.
283674718,The Dallas Cowboys are going with an in-house option for their next head coach. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer and the Cowboys have agreed to a deal to make him Dallas' next head coach_ the team announced on Friday. Schottenheimer_ 51_ has been on the Cowboys' coaching staff for the last three seasons_ serving as their offensive coordinator since 2023. However_ former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy handled the offensive playcalling duties over the last two years. Still_ Schottenheimer's promotion aligned with quarterback Dak Prescott's best season. The Cowboys quarterback finished second in MVP voting in 2023_ leading the league in passing touchdowns that year en route to the team's third straight 12-5 season. Now_ Schottenheimer will be tasked with helping Prescott return to that level along with improving the rest of the Cowboys' roster following a disappointing 7-10 season in 2024. Prescott_ who'll be 32 when the 2025 season begins_ missed the back half of 2024 after undergoing hamstring surgery_ which came following his early-season struggles. Prescott's injury_ along with a handful of others_ played a big part in why Dallas started the year 3-7_ essentially ending its playoff hopes before Thanksgiving. The Cowboys opted to keep McCarthy around through the end of the season_ but announced that they were unable to come to terms on a new deal on Jan. 13_ a day before his contract was set to expire. The Cowboys' decision to part with McCarthy made them the seventh team this offseason to have a head coach vacancy_ but it came over a week after the end of the regular season. As a result_ Dallas missed out on the opportunity to speak with a few of the top coaching candidates early on_ such as Mike Vrabel_ Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn. Dallas didn't conduct many interviews_ though_ in its search to replace McCarthy. Former Jets head coach Robert Saleh_ Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore (who previously played and coached for the Cowboys) and Seahawks assistant head coach Leslie Frazier were the only other three candidates to interview for the opening. There were also some rumors that Colorado coach and former Cowboys star Deion Sanders was a top candidate for the opening. Despite reports of mutual interest_ Sanders never officially interviewed for the job. Jones also informally spoke to former Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. Schottenheimer has never been a head coach before_ but he brings nearly three decades of experience as an offensive assistant coach to the table. He served as an offensive coordinator for a few other teams before joining the Cowboys in 2022_ working in that role for the Jets (2006-11)_ Rams (2012-14) and Seahawks (2018-20). Schottenheimer is also the son of decorated former NFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer. The elder Schottenheimer was a head coach for four teams_ recording the ninth-most wins (205) for a coach in NFL history. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

283726482,WASHINGTON – The Senate is heading towards a vote on confirming South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary_ placing her at the head of a sprawling agency that will be essential to both national security and President Donald Trump’s plans to squash illegal immigration.  Republicans were determined to barrel through on Noem’s confirmation_ threatening to keep the Senate working through the weekend to install Trump’s national security Cabinet officials. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth won confirmation Friday night_ and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were already in place.  Noem_ a Trump ally who is in her second term as South Dakota governor_ received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier this week. Republicans_ who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her_ have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement.  “Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities_” Senate Majority Leader John Thune_ a fellow South Dakota Republican_ said Friday. “And it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.”  Noem will oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection_ Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies_ the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation_ protecting dignitaries_ responding to natural disasters and more.  Trump is planning major changes to the way the department functions_ including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday.  During her confirmation hearing_ Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to.  Noem avoided saying that she would defy the president_ but told the homeland security panel_ “I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.”  Still_ Noem will be entering a job that was a pressure cooker under the first Trump administration. Six people cycled through the homeland security secretary position during his first four years in office.  Noem_ who held her state’s lone U.S. House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019_ has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point_ she was even under consideration to be his running mate.  Her political stock took a momentary dip_ however_ when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog_ as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Now she will be tasked with delivering on Trump’s favorite issue_ border security. The president’s goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could also still put Noem_ with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm_ in a difficult position. In her home state of South Dakota_ many migrants_ some in the country without permanent legal status_ power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing.  She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president’s orders and copied his talk of an “invasion” at the U.S. border with Mexico.  As governor_ Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star_ which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost.  Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops “because of this invasion_” adding that “it is a war zone down there.”
283706886,President Trump fired 17 inspectors general_ the internal watchdogs who monitor federal agencies_ on Friday night_ capping a week of dramatic shake-ups of the federal bureaucracy with a focus on loyalty to the president_ three people with knowledge of the matter said.  The sweeping move did not affect Michael E. Horowitz_ the inspector general for the Justice Department_ according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. But inspectors general at several major agencies were believed to have been fired.  The Washington Post reported the firings earlier. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  People involved in the Trump transition had signaled such a shake-up was likely. And it is in keeping with an effort that Mr. Trump began in early 2020_ when he dismissed five inspectors general from their roles.
283659086,Aryna Sabalenka faces Madison Keys in the Australian Open final on Saturday_ Jan. 25_ 2025 (1/25/25) at Melbourne Park in Melbourne_ Victoria.  Fans can watch a majority of the action throughout the tournament for free via a trial of DirecTV Stream or fuboTV_ or via a subscription to Sling TV. Select windows can also be viewed on ESPN+.  Here’s what you need to know:  What: Australian Open  Who: Aryna Sabalenka vs. Madison Keys  When: Saturday_ Jan. 25_ 2025 (1/25/25  Where: Melbourne Park  Time: 3:30 a.m. ET  Live stream: DirecTV Stream_ fuboTV_ Sling TV  Here’s a recent AP story:  MELBOURNE_ Australia (AP) — The Madison Keys who will play two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka for the title at the Australian Open on Saturday night is not the same Madison Keys who was the runner-up at the U.S. Open back in 2017_ the one other time the American participated in a Grand Slam final.  Her racket is different_ for one thing_ a switch made ahead of this season to help protect her right shoulder and offer more controlled power. Her coach is different_ too_ as of 2023: her husband_ Bjorn Fratangelo. And her mindset is different_ Keys explained a little past 1 a.m. on Friday after upsetting Iga Swiatek in the semifinals at Melbourne Park.  The 6-3_ 6-0 loss at age 22 to her close friend Sloane Stephens at Arthur Ashe Stadium with a trophy at stake helped shape the way Keys will approach matters when she steps into Rod Laver Arena less than a month before her 30th birthday to face Sabalenka with another major title in the offing.  After that U.S. Open final_ in which she made 30 unforced errors_ Keys acknowledged not having “handled the occasion perfectly” and figured her performance “came down to nerves and all of that.”  The experience stuck with her.  “I’ve obviously thought of that match endlessly for the past eight years_” Keys said. “During that match_ I was so consumed with being nervous and the moment and the opportunity and all of that_ that I never really gave myself a chance to actually play.”  It took her a while to realize that the problem wasn’t so much the jitters themselves. Those are normal. Everyone feels them.  Instead_ she needed to learn not to worry about them and swing away.  “I’ve done a lot of work trying to NOT get rid of nerves_ because I think in the past_ in my head_ it was kind of always_ ‘The people who play amazing in the tight moments_ they either don’t have nerves or they figure out how to get rid of them_’” Keys explained.  “The big thing for me has just been knowing that there are going to be a lot of moments where I’m uncomfortable in the match. It’s going to be stressful. You have thousands of people watching you. You might not be playing your best tennis_” she said. “But instead of trying to shy away from that and search for settling or comfort or anything_ just being OK that that’s the situation — and you can also play tennis through that — is something that I’ve been working really hard on.”  And so there Keys was in the semifinals in Melbourne_ not merely in the crucible of a third set against a former No. 1 and five-time Grand Slam champion in Swiatek_ but even standing one point from defeat at 6-5_ 40-30.  The 19th-seeded Keys then trailed 8-7 in the third-set tiebreaker_ two points from defeat. She wouldn’t drop another point on the way to closing out the 5-7_ 6-1_ 7-6 (10-8) victory.  “At the end_ Madison was kind of brave with her decisions_” said Swiatek_ who lost more games to Keys in the semifinal than the 14 in her previous five matches combined.  Whatever self-doubt might have been present by Keys was masked rather effectively.  “That’s probably one of the biggest lessons that I can take from that U.S. Open final — just be OK with knowing that I’m probably going to be uncomfortable 99% of the time that I’m on the court_” Keys said_ “and that’s OK.”  Fratangelo_ a former professional player_ has emphasized to Keys that she needs to stick to her point-ending quick strikes.  When Keys went to a third set against 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina in the fourth round of this Australian Open_ Fratangelo reminded his wife of the need to stay aggressive.  His message?  “Don’t lose being passive_ because it’s not who you are. Let a counterpuncher lose being passive_ because that’s what they do_” he said. “You lose putting your foot on the gas pedal_ and that’s OK.”  That is also a perfect description of Sabalenka’s style. She’s learned to control her strokes_ and will mix in a slice or drop shot every so often_ mind you_ but the grunt-accompanied huge serves and groundstrokes are still her hallmarks.  As is her lack of hesitation.  “What’s really impressive is her mentality — her ability to kind of always go for it_ no matter what the score is_” Keys said.  Keys tries to emulate that aspect of the No. 1-seeded Sabalenka_ listed as a -325 money-line favorite_ according to BetMGM Sportsbook_ as she tries to become the first woman since Martina Hingis in 1997-99 with three consecutive Australian Open trophies.  “She plays such fearless tennis. She has the ability to play so well that way. It’s very unique_” said Keys_ whose 1-4 career record against Sabalanka includes a loss in the U.S. Open semifinals two years ago. “A lot of people_ no matter what_ even if it was a tight point_ you kind of expect them to play a little bit more conservative or back down a little bit_ and you know she’s not going to do that.”  Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

His energy_ creativity_ and commitment to the craft will never be forgotten.”  “We ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. We also want to thank everyone who has supported DJ Unk and the Oomp Camp over the years.”  Roberson_ “Rest in peace_ Unk. You will forever be missed. Now walk it out!”  In her Facebook post_ the rapper’s significant other asked for privacy.  “Please respect me and my family. I just lost my husband and my kids just lost their father_” Long-Platt wrote. “Our life will never be the same. I LOVE YOU ANTHONY FOREVER.”  DJ Unk rose to fame in the mid-2000s with his debut album_ “Beat’n Down Yo Block!” He had two breakout singles from the 2006 record — “Walk It Out_” which climbed into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart_ followed by “2 Step.”  A friend of the family told The Post_ “Unk never stopped touring and performing. No matter where you were_ when you heard Walk It Out_ you were guaranteed to start dancing.”  “‘Walk It Out’ and ‘2 Step’ remained two of the hottest songs on the planet. They will forever be considered legendary.”  The friend added_ “Unk was active in the studio up until the very end. Music was always near and dear to his heart.”  This is a developing story.
283947254,By Will Weissert and Zeke Miller | Associated Press  ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said Saturday he’d like to see Jordan_ Egypt and other Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip — potentially moving out enough of the population to “just clean out” the war-torn area to create virtual clean slate.  During a 20-minute question-and-answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday_ Trump said he discussed his vision on a call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt.  “I’d like him to take people. I’d like Egypt to take people_” said Trump. “You’re talking about_ probably a million and a half people_ and we just clean out that whole thing and say_ ‘You know it’s_ over.'”  Speaking about the effects of Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza_ Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king_ “I’d love for you to take on more_ cause I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now_ and it’s a mess. It’s a real mess.”  He said of such a mass movement of Palestinians_ “it could be temporary or long term_” adding that the area of the world that encompasses Gaza_ “over centuries” has “had many_ many conflicts.”  “Something has to happen_” Trump said. “But it’s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything’s demolished_ and people are dying there.” He added: “So_ I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations_ and build housing in a different location_ where they can maybe live in peace for a change.”
284045484,An inside look at the Commanders-Eagles NFC Championship showdown at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday afternoon:   Marquee matchup  Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels vs. Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson  Daniels is trying to add a layer to the best rookie quarterback season of all time by becoming the first to reach the Super Bowl.   Most of his throws go to 1_000-yard receiver Terry McLaurin_ but tight end Zach Ertz has re-emerged as a first look in the red zone late in his career.  Standing in their way is a ballhawk with six interceptions in each of his past two seasons playing for the Eagles (2022 and 2024).  Is it a coincidence that Daniels threw three of his five touchdown passes against the Eagles in Week 16 after Gardner-Johnson was ejected early in the third quarter for two personal-foul penalties? Johnson said afterward that he has to “grow the hell up.”  “I think he’s always known how important he is to the defense. We sure do_” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “He’s been just so good at taking the football away and playing with energy. He has an impact on games.”  Dunleavy’s decision  An argument can be made the Eagles’ roster is better at every position except the most important one_ where Daniels might already be the NFC’s best quarterback.  Saquon Barkley has been unstoppable all season — even more so against the Commanders (296 yards and four touchdowns on the ground in two games).   He and the four Pro Bowlers on the offensive line could win the game on their own.  Defensive tackle Jalen Carter took his Pro Bowl season to new heights with two sacks and a forced fumble last game.   Not a good first time for the Commanders to be without their best offensive lineman_ after right guard Sam Cosmi’s ACL injury.  Eagles 31_ Commanders 27  Hurts so good: Quarterback Jalen Hurts (knee) was a full participant in Thursday’s and Friday’s practices after he was limited Wednesday. His mobility clearly was limited at the end of last week’s win.   Hurts said his recovery is “progressing” but he “anticipates” wearing a knee brace. If he scrambles_ the Commanders won’t take sympathy.  “We are going to treat him like a running back_” defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. said. “We are going to hit him that way. That’s their decision if they want to get him hit the way that he gets hit.”  Tight end Dallas Goedert (ankle) is ready to go after not practicing Thursday. Center Cam Jurgens (back) is questionable.  For the Commanders_ defensive tackle Da’Ron Payne (knee_ finger) is out_ but linebacker Bobby Wagner (ankle) will play.  Revenge game: Brian Johnson was considered a rising star when the Eagles made the Super Bowl two years ago.   He was the quarterbacks coach responsible for Hurts’ rapid development into NFL MVP runner-up and offensive coordinator-in-waiting as soon as Shane Steichen left to be the Colts head coach.  Well_ Johnson’s one season calling plays was a disappointment. He was fired last January.   One year later_ Johnson is passing game coordinator for the Commanders under offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury during Jayden Daniels’ rookie-record-setting debut.  “Just being able to share some things he used with Jalen there in Philly — some things that worked_ some things he wishes he would’ve done differently — with Jayden has been huge_” Kingsbury said. “Because obviously that’s instant credibility of success they had there. He’s been a blessing for us.”  Third-and-8: With a win_ the Commanders will become just the third No. 6 seed to reach the playoffs and the third team to beat its conference’s top three seeds (No. 3 Buccaneers_ No. 1 Lions and No. 2 Eagles) en route to the Super Bowl.  Dan Quinn_ who previously took the 2016 Falcons to the Super Bowl_ would join Bill Parcells (Patriots_ Giants)_ Don Shula (Colts_ Dolphins)_ Dick Vermeil (Eagles_ Rams)_ John Fox (Panthers_ Broncos)_ Mike Holmgren (Packers_ Seahawks)_ Dan Reeves (Falcons_ Broncos) and Andy Reid (Chiefs_ Eagles) as the eighth head coach to lead multiple franchises to the Super Bowl.   Parcells_ Shula and Vermeil are Hall of Famers_ Holmgren is a current finalist_ Reeves is overdue for selection and Reid is a future lock.  Fourth-and-gutsy: The Commanders led the NFL during the regular season by converting nearly 87 percent of fourth downs (20-for-23).   Their 66.7 percent hit rate in the playoffs (6-for-9) against good defenses is even more impressive.  Quinn bypassed four field goals in the win against the Buccaneers_ turning 12 points into 14 when going 2-for-4 on fourth downs led to two touchdowns.   The Commanders’ three conversions against the Lions — one of the NFL’s most aggressive fourth-down teams — all led to touchdowns.  The Eagles converted 73 percent (19-for-26) during the regular season on the back of one of the most unstoppable plays in the NFL: the “Tush Push.” Nine out of 10 fourth-and-1 runs moved the chains.   One of coach Nick Sirianni’s four-year hallmarks is going for fourth downs in Eagles’ territory.  “I think the game flow and things like that will have an impact on it once you get into later moments_” Sirianni said. “That will be a key to the game on both ends.”
284054926,MELBOURNE_ Australia -- Jannik Sinner claimed his second consecutive Australian Open championship on Sunday_ never facing a single break point and using his complete game to outplay and frustrate Alexander Zverev for a 6-3_ 7-6 (4)_ 6-3 victory in the final.  Sinner_ a 23-year-old Italian_ is the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93.  Sinner rose to No. 1 last June_ remaining there for every week since_ and the gap between him and No. 2-ranked Zverev was pronounced as can be in Rod Laver Arena. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019_ when No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal -- also in straight sets.  Here's how dominant Sinner has been since the start of last season: He has won three of the five major tournaments_ including the US Open in September_ and his record in that span is 80-6 with a total of nine tournament titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches_ dating to last year.  The only thing that's clouded the past 12 months for Sinner_ it seems_ is a doping case in which he was cleared by a ruling that was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was exonerated in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April.  While Sinner became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals_ Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3_ adding this loss to those at the 2020 US Open and the 2024 French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  There truly was only one moment that felt as if it contained a hint of tension. It was late in the second set_ which Zverev was two points from owning when he led 5-4 and got to love-30 on Sinner's serve. But a break point -- and a set point -- never arrived there.  Zverev did not get closer_ dropping the next four points_ making it 5-all. Sinner then emerged with the ensuing tiebreaker. No surprise there: He went 4-0 in those set-deciders over the past two weeks and has grabbed 16 of his past 18.  A year ago_ Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first Slam_ needing to get past Djokovic -- who quit one set into his semifinal against Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring -- first_ before erasing a two-set deficit in the final against 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  Beating Zverev allowed Sinner to become the first man since Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later.
284034918,From his jail cell_ Mr. Yoon has vowed to fight to regain office.  A majority of South Koreans approved of his impeachment and consider him guilty of insurrection_ according to public opinion polls. But Mr. Yoon’s die-hard supporters have called his impeachment “fraud.” Some of them shocked the country when they vandalized a courthouse in Seoul after one of its judges approved a warrant to arrest him on Jan. 19. Nearly 60 people were arrested in connection with that unrest.  Prosecutors said that Mr. Yoon committed insurrection during the short-lived imposition of marital law when_ they said_ he banned all political activities and ordered military commanders to break the Assembly’s doors down “with axes” or “by shooting_ if necessary” and “drag out” lawmakers. They said Mr. Yoon sent the troops there to seize the Assembly and detain political leaders.  The nation watched the live-streamed scenes of special forces troops armed with assault rifles storming the Assembly as lawmakers were gathering there to vote against martial law. But Mr. Yoon has rejected the charge of insurrection_ saying that he never intended to neutralize the Parliament or arrest political leaders. The troops were there to “keep order_” he said.  Mr. Yoon’s indictment_ although not a surprise_ came sooner than expected.  State prosecutors have been investigating the former defense minister and generals. The country’s Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials took on the insurrection case against Mr. Yoon_ but by law_ only prosecutors can indict him.  Mr. Yoon has refused to cooperate with the inquiry; he and his lawyers have insisted that the four-year-old office has no right to investigate him.
283975214,LOS ANGELES (AP) — After weeks of windy and dry weather_ rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such as toxic ash runoff.  Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation_ shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires_ which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7.   Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days_ but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills_ the National Weather Service said on social media.   “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area_” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”   Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday_ forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas_ while snow was likely in the mountains.   Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities_ while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.  Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars_ electronics_ batteries_ building materials_ paints_ furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides_ asbestos_ plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.  Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018_ when the town of Montecito_ up the coast from LA_ was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.   While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity_ several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires_ which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14_000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.  In northern Los Angeles County_ firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire_ which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic.   In San Diego County_ there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.   The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year_ which began Oct. 1_ the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.   Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought_” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

283989336,Timothée Chalamet brought the house down as the host and musical guest of “Saturday Night Live.”  The actor_ who was just nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown_” solidified himself as a multitalented entertainer on the NBC sketch comedy show over the weekend.  In his opening monologue_ Chalamet poked fun at his failure to win trophies at Hollywood events over the years.  “It’s an enormous honor going to these award shows. It’s such a great experience_ but I just keep losing_ and each time it gets harder to pretend it doesn’t sting_” he quipped before a compilation video showed his reactions to coming up short to Gary Oldman and Mahershala Ali.  “But the most embarrassing part is I’ve had this sad little speech in my pocket for four years that I’ve never gotten a chance to read_” Chalamet added.  The “Wonka” star_ 29_ also performed Dylan’s songs “Outlaw Blues_” “Three Angels” and “Tomorrow Is a Long Time” — accompanied by James Blake on the piano — after playing the musician in the biopic_ which premiered in December 2024.  Chalamet said Dylan’s music and career have been a “guiding light” to him.  Chalamet teased his “SNL” appearance earlier this week with a hilarious promotional video involving his look-alikes. The teaser was a callback to the headline-making moment when he showed up to a “Timothée Chalamet look-alike contest” in New York City last October.  Chalamet’s girlfriend_ Kylie Jenner_ was not shown in audience after recently joining him for a romantic getaway in Paris last week.  The Kylie Cosmetics founder_ 27_ has been a huge supporter of Chalamet’s acting career and was by his side at the 2025 Golden Globes earlier this month.  Page Six exclusively reported that Jenner was thrilled over her beau’s best actor Oscar nomination for his role in “A Complete Unknown.”  The honor marks the second time Chalamet has been up for the coveted award as he received a nomination in the same category for his 2018 breakout film_ “Call Me By Your Name.”  Our source told us the makeup mogul was “screaming with excitement” when he received the news and “had a feeling Timothée was going to be nominated.”  “Actually seeing his name pop up on the TV screen was incredible_” the insider added.  The source also told Page Six that Jenner is “ecstatic” and “so proud of him” for being nominated again.  “Kylie is absolutely thrilled and can’t wait to see Timothée in person so they can celebrate this special moment in his life_” the insider shared.  The lovebirds were first romantically linked in 2023. While Jenner and Chalamet initially kept their romance private_ they have since shown plenty of PDA at public events like the US Open and a star-studded Beyoncé concert.  The duo have yet to make their official red carpet debut as a couple. However_ sources previously told us that Jenner never wants to take the moment away from Chalamet at events related to his projects.
284141280,President Trump fumed on Sunday after Colombia turned back two US military flights carrying deported migrants — vowing to impose sanctions and an “emergency 25% tariff” on the South American country.  “I was just informed that two repatriation flights from the United States_ with a large number of Illegal Criminals_ were not allowed to land in Colombia_” Trump wrote Sunday.  “This order was given by Colombia’s Socialist President Gustavo Petro_ who is already very unpopular amongst his people_” he said_ adding that Petro’s decision has “jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States.”  In response_ the president said he would enacted the “emergency 25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States_” adding that it would be raised to 50% in a week.  He also called for a travel ban_ visa revocations on Colombian government officials_ visa sanctions on party members and government supporters_ enhanced customs and border protection inspections of any Colombian national and banking and financial sanctions.  “These measures are just the beginning_” Trump said. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!”  The angry post came after Petro blocked the military jets’ arrival.  In a social media post_ Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t slam the door on deportation flights.  Instead_ he demanded the US use civilian planes and create better protocols for how it treats deportees.  Colombian migrants can’t stay in a country that doesn’t want them_ he conceded.  But they must be returned “with dignity and respect for them and for our country_” he said.  “We will receive our fellow citizens on civilian planes_ without treating them like criminals.”

284074472,At the beginning of the season_ plenty of people would have predicted that the Eagles would reach the NFC Championship Game. Few could have predicted the Commanders would make it_ considering many didn't expect them to even get into the playoffs.  Now_ Washington shouldn't be overlooked. With rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels powering one impressive win after another_ the Commanders are a legitimate threat to win the NFC title and make their first Super Bowl appearance since the 1991 season.  The sportsbooks may be disrespecting Washington a bit based on the sizable spread.  This game should be closer than the betting line indicates. The Eagles and the Commanders played a pair of competitive contests during the regular season_ and this should be another one that comes down to the fourth quarter.  The X-factor for the matchup could be Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts' injured left knee. It's possible the 26-year-old will wear a brace for the game_ and it's unknown how that could potentially impact his mobility.  Hurts missed a large chunk of the Eagles' Week 16 matchup at Washington due to a concussion_ and a Kenny Pickett-led Philadelphia squad couldn't hold on for a win.  As long as Hurts can play all of Sunday's game_ the Eagles remain the favorite. And they should find a way to win_ especially because of how much trouble opposing defenses have had trying to stop star running back Saquon Barkley.  The Commanders know Barkley well_ and they've seen firsthand how he can take over a game many times. He should break at least one long touchdown run on Sunday_ as he frequently does.  Washington won't go down without a fight_ and the margin of Philadelphia's victory will be fewer than six points. So expect an exciting game that eventually goes in the Eagles' favor_ as they'll head to the Super Bowl for the third time in eight seasons.  Prediction: Eagles 32_ Commanders 28  Gambling problem?

284196878,Always rooting for the guy on the Chiefs.   Taylor Swift celebrated a Kansas City Chiefs touchdown against the Buffalo Bills during Sunday’s AFC Championship game.  The pop star wrapped her mom_ Andrea_ in a hug after wide receiver Xavier Worthy leapt into the end zone to give the Chiefs a second-quarter lead over the Bills.   The Swifts then encouraged Travis Kelce’s mom_ Donna_ to join them in their celebration.   Donna reached her arm out and gave Andrea and Taylor a squeeze.   Follow Page Six’s Taylor Swift live updates for the latest news_ photos_ fan theories and more  Swift_ who wore head-to-toe Louis Vuitton to the game — was also accompanied by her dad_ Scott_ and brother_ Austin.  The “Fortnight” singer_ 35_ was in the stands at Arrowhead Stadium last weekend when the Chiefs beat the Houston Texans_ 23-14.  Swift brought a star-studded entourage along for the big game — including Brooke Shields and WNBA star Caitlin Clark_ who is a longtime Swiftie.   The 14-time Grammy winner_ who wore a pricey head-to-toe Chanel outfit_ was seen adorably copying Kelce’s first down signal and going crazy after he scored a touchdown.   Although the couple — who began dating last summer — celebrated the win that night_ Swift flew back to New York City on Monday so that Kelce could focus on the highly anticipated AFC championship.  The winner of Sunday’s match-up will face off against the Philadelphia Eagles_ who beat the Washington Commanders earlier in the day_ in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9.  The Missouri-based squad is vying for it’s third straight Super Bowl appearance after taking home the hardware in 2024 and 2023. They also won in 2020.  Meanwhile_ the Bills have never raised the coveted Lombardi Trophy_ with their last Super Bowl appearance falling over 30 years ago.   Whoever wins will have an extra week off before the big game_ meaning Swift could attend the Grammys on Feb. 2 and the Super Bowl the following week if the Chiefs come out victorious.   However_ like last year_ Kelce likely wouldn’t be able to join her at the awards show given the strict schedule leading up to the game. Both AFC and NFC teams are expected to be in New Orleans one week before the Super Bowl for practice and media.
284259016,The world marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday_ with some of the few remaining survivors set to attend ceremonies at the site of the notorious Nazi death camp.Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews_ one million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945_ along with more than 100_000 non-Jews.On Monday former inmates_ along with Polish President Andrzej Duda_ are expected to lay flowers at the sprawling camp's Wall of Death in the morning.Around 50 survivors are then expected at a commemoration from 1500 GMT outside the gates of Auschwitz II-Birkenau alongside dozens of leaders_ including Britain's King Charles III and French President Emmanuel Macron.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Olaf Scholz are both expected_ as well as Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch."This year we will focus on the survivors and their message_" Auschwitz Museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki told AFP. "There will not be any speeches by politicians."Speaking to AFP ahead of the anniversary_ survivors around the world spoke about the need to preserve the memory of what happened when there will no longer be living witnesses.They also warned about rising hatred and anti-Semitism around the world and spoke of their fears about history repeating itself.Organisers said it could be the last major anniversary with such a large group of survivors."We all know that in 10 years it will not be possible to have a large group for the 90th anniversary_" Sawicki said.Auschwitz was created in 1940 using barracks in Oswiecim_ southern Poland. Its name was Germanised into Auschwitz by the Nazis.The first 728 Polish political prisoners arrived on June 14 of that year.On January 17_ 1945_ as Soviet troops advanced_ the SS forced 60_000 emaciated prisoners to walk west in what became known as the "Death March".From January 21-26_ the Germans blew up the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria and withdrew as Soviet troops approached.On January 27_ Soviet troops arrived_ finding 7_000 survivors.The day of its liberation has been designated by the United Nations as Holocaust Remembrance Day.Until its invasion of Ukraine in 2022_ a Russian delegation had always attended the annual liberation ceremony but Moscow will be barred again this year.There has also been controversy following rumours about the possibility that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could attend the ceremony.The International Criminal Court last year issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on suspicion of crimes against humanity and war crimes over the war in Gaza.After a request from Duda_ the Polish government confirmed last month that it would not arrest Netanyahu if he were to visit_ even though the Israeli leader has not expressed any intentions to attend.Some 40 survivors of the Nazi camps agreed to talk to AFP in the run up to the anniversary.In 15 countries_ from Israel to Poland_ Russia to Argentina_ Canada to South Africa they sat in front of our cameras to tell their stories_ alone or surrounded by their children_ grandchildren and great grandchildren -- proof of their victory over absolute evil."How did the world allow Auschwitz?" asked 95-year-old Marta Neuwirth from Santiago_ Chile.She was 15 when she was sent from Hungary to Auschwitz.Julia Wallach_ who is nearly 100_ has difficulty talking about what happened without crying."It is too difficult to talk about_ too hard_" she said. The Parisian was dragged off a lorry destined for the gas chamber in Birkenau at the last minute.But hard as it is to relive the horrors_ she insisted she would continue to give witness."As long as I can do it_ I will do it." Beside her_ her granddaughter Frankie asked: "Will they believe us when we talk about this when she is not there?"That is why Esther Senot_ 97_ braved the Polish winter last month to go back to Birkenau with French high school students. She was keeping a promise she made in 1944 to her dying sister Fanny_ who -- laid out on the straw coughing up blood -- asked her with her last breath to "tell what happened to us so that we are not forgotten by history".
284393176,Big technology stocks including Nvidia_ Microsoft_ Meta and Tesla tumbled in premarket trading on concerns that a Chinese artificial intelligence startup could threaten America’s dominance in AI.  Shares of Nvidia plunged nearly 12% on news reports about the capabilities of DeepSeek — a China-based startup which has made waves in the industry after launching a free_ open-source large-language model in December.  DeepSeek was reportedly developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a stark contrast to the billions of dollars typically spent by Western tech giants on AI research and infrastructure.  The developments triggered a global sell-off_ particularly impacting semiconductor firms_ as fears mounted over the sustainability of US dominance in the sector.  Shares of Nvidia_ a key player in AI-driven chip design and a significant beneficiary of the AI boom_ plummeted 11.8% as of 07:05 a.m. Eastern Time before the market opened on Monday.  Microsoft_ which has plowed billions of dollars into Sam Altman’s OpenAI_ the company behind ChatGPT_ was off 4.1% in premarket trading. Shares of Meta were off 1.7% while Tesla saw its share price drop by more than 2.7% in pre-market trading.  European chipmakers also faced sharp declines_ with Netherlands-based ASML and ASM International falling 8.9% and 13.6%_ respectively.  Meanwhile_ Nasdaq futures have tumbled 2.3%_ S&P 500 futures have declined 1.3% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have decreased by 0.9% before the opening bell on Monday.  The rapid progress of DeepSeek has sparked scrutiny over the immense sums being funneled into AI research by leading US firms_ raising questions about efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive_” said Srini Pajjuri_ a semiconductor analyst at Raymond James_ in a note on Monday.  Meanwhile_ analysts at Citi recognize that DeepSeek’s technological strides have raised investor questions about the cost of computational power.  However_ they emphasize that American companies still maintain a significant advantage due to their access to the most sophisticated chips.  “While the dominance of US companies in the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged_ their access to high-end GPUs remains a key differentiator_” Citi analysts stated in a note.  The market turbulence coincides with a broader push by the US government to reinforce AI leadership.  President Trump recently announced a $500 billion AI initiative known as Stargate.  The vast sum of money being invested in the project_ which includes the involvement of top firms such as OpenAI_ Oracle and SoftBank_ underscores the strategic importance of advanced chips in maintaining American competitiveness in AI development.

284256622,BOGOTA_ Colombia — The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday_ hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner.  Long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts_ the U.S. and Colombia clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a show of what other countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The White House held up the episode as a warning to other nations who might seek to impede his plans.  Earlier_ the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions_ 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods_ which would be raised to 50% in one week_ and other retaliatory measures sparked by President Gustavo Petro's decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants after Petro accused Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation. Petro also announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods.  Trump said the measures were necessary because Petro's decision "jeopardized" national security in the U.S. by blocking the deportation flights.  "These measures are just the beginning_" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. "We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States."  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late Sunday statement that the "Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms_ including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States_ including on U.S. military aircraft_ without limitation or delay."  Leavitt said the tariff orders will be "held in reserve_ and not signed." But Leavitt said Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country_ "until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned."  The Colombian government late Sunday said it considered as "overcome" the episode with the Trump administration and Petro reposted the statement from the White House on X.  "We have overcome the impasse with the United States government_" said Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. "We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees_ guaranteeing them decent conditions as citizens subject to rights."  Murillo added that the South American country's presidential aircraft is available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes.  Earlier Sunday_ U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families "who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations." They were being imposed on top of the State Department's move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia's capital_ Bogota.  Petro had said earlier that his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with "dignity." Petro made the announcement in two X posts_ one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.  "A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves_" Petro said. "That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes_ without being treated like criminals_ we will receive our fellow citizens."  After Trump's earlier tariff threat_ Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the "foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%."  Colombia has traditionally been the U.S.'s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro_ a former guerrilla_ became Colombia's first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S.  Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024_ fifth behind Guatemala_ Honduras_ Mexico and El Salvador_ according to Witness at the Border_ an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.  Colombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.  The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.  "This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights_" a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly.  Rubio in a statement said Petro "canceled his authorization" for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.  Colombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico_ aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127_604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September_ behind Mexicans_ Guatemalans and Venezuelans.  Mexico hasn't imposed visa restrictions on Colombians_ as they have on Venezuelans_ Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.  Petro's government in a statement later announced that the South American country's presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them "dignified conditions."  As part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration_ his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations.  Two U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day_ Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.  Colombia is the U.S.'s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil_ shipping about 209_000 barrels of oil per day last year_ although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.' dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.'s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers.

284354344,LOS ANGELES (AP) — More rain fell Monday on parts of Southern California after causing mudflows over the weekend_ helping firefighters but boosting the risk of toxic ash runoff in areas scorched by Los Angeles-area wildfires.  Flood watches were in effect for burn areas from recent fires that broke out around the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles_ Altadena and Castaic Lake_ said Joe Sirard_ a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.  “All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff_” Sirard said_ warning of even small amounts of rain in a few minutes’ time. “What that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows once we get above those thresholds.”  A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County was closed as of Sunday afternoon due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon_ the California Department of Transportation said. Snow fell in the mountains.  One benefit that could come from the rain: It may help firefighters who are reining in multiple wildfires after weeks of windy and dry weather.  Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation_ shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires_ which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on Jan. 7.   The Palisades Fire_ the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people_ reached 90% containment Sunday. The Eaton Fire_ which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 16 people_ was 98% contained.  The Hughes Fire_ which ignited last week north of Los Angeles and caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50_000 people_ was 95% contained as of Sunday evening.  In San Diego County_ firefighters made progress to contain the smaller Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.   Most of the region was forecast to get about an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days_ but the weather service warned of a risk of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills.   “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area_” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said on social media. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”   Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities_ while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.  Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars_ electronics_ batteries_ building materials_ paints_ furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides_ asbestos_ plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.  Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018_ when the town of Montecito_ up the coast from Los Angeles_ was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.   The rain snapped a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought_” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

284575624,The White House budget office is ordering a pause to all grants and loans disbursed by the federal government_ according to an internal memo sent to agencies Monday_ creating significant confusion across Washington.  In a two-page document_ Matthew J. Vaeth_ the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget_ instructs federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.” The memo_ a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post_ also calls for each agency to perform a “comprehensive analysis” to ensure its grant and loan programs are consistent with President Donald Trump’s executive orders_ which aimed to ban federal diversity_ equity and inclusion initiatives_ and limit clean energy spending_ among other measures.
284550474,Google is saying goodbye to the Gulf of Mexico. Moving forward_ Google Maps will call it the Gulf of America_ the tech giant announced on Monday_ a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming it on his first day back in office.  “We have received a few questions about naming within Google Maps_” Google posted on X. “We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.”  Google also said it would be changing Denali — the tallest mountain in North America — back to Mt. McKinley_ following a different executive order from Trump. The Alaska mountain had been renamed in 2015 to Denali by then-President Barack Obama; it was initially named after President William McKinley in 1896.  The new changes had not gone into effect on Google Maps by Monday afternoon; Google said it would be updating its app “quickly” to reflect the new names.   Interestingly_ Google said that while American users will see the “official local name_” users “in the rest of the world see both names” for the locations.  The changes come after Sundar Pichai_ the CEO of Alphabet_ Google’s parent company_ sat behind President Trump at his inauguration last week. A number of other tech execs — including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg_ Tesla and X boss Elon Musk_ Apple CEO Tim Cook_ and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — were there alongside Pichai. You can read more about their trip to Washington_ D.C._ and what Trump fans thought about their support_ by clicking here.
284600290,Jan. 27 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday night to reshape the military as he focused on transgender service members; diversity_ equity and inclusion programs; troops who refused COVID-19 vaccines and a missile defense system called the "Iron Dome."  The president signed the four executive orders aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington_ D.C._ after speaking at a House GOP retreat in Florida.  While Trump did not immediately ban transgender service members from the armed forces_ his executive order directs the Pentagon to come up with a policy for transgender troops based on readiness.  "To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world_ we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone_" Trump told House Republicans on Monday at his property in Doral_ Fla.  Trump's second executive order bans the use of DEI_ race or "gender ideologies" in the military. Last week_ Trump signed an executive order to end DEI programs throughout the federal government_ placing DEI workers on paid leave.  "I ordered the end to all of the lawless diversity_ equity and inclusion nonsense policies across the government and all across the private sector and the military_" Trump said Monday. "We're getting it out and we've gotten out pretty much. We did that in one week_ and it wasn't easy_ but everybody wanted it."  Earlier Monday_ newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters outside of the Pentagon that reinstating troops who resisted the COVID-19 mandates and creating a missile defense system were also among Trump's executive orders.  "Today_ there are more executive orders coming_ ... on removing DEI inside the Pentagon_ reinstating troops who were pushed out because of Covid mandates_ iron dome for America."  "This is happening quickly_ and as the secretary of defense_ it's an honor to salute smartly_ as I did as a junior officer and now as the secretary of defense_ to ensure these orders are complied with rapidly and quickly_" Hegseth added.  Hegseth was confirmed Friday as defense secretary by a narrow margin of 51-50 in the U.S. Senate with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Monday marked his first official week on the job.  Trump's third executive order directs Hegseth to reinstate all active and reserve military_ who were discharged for failing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The service members will be reinstated with their former rank and provided back pay and benefits. Approximately 8_000 service members were discharged between August 2021 and January 2023 for refusing COVID-19 mandates.  The fourth executive order would begin the process of creating a "next generation" short-range missile defense shield for the United States_ much like Israel's Iron Dome.  To "immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield_ which will be able to protect Americans_" Trump added. The project is expected to take years.  Shortly after his inauguration last week_ Trump signed an executive order_ recognizing only two genders_ male and female. The president also revoked an executive order signed by former President Joe Biden in 2021 that allowed transgender people to serve in the military.  "It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery_ which often involves the use of heavy narcotics_" according to a fact sheet read by an official Monday_ according to CNN. "During this period_ they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements."  Independent research institute the Palm Center found in 2018 that there were an estimated 14_000 transgender service members in the U.S. military.  During his first term_ Trump made exceptions for transgender service members already serving in uniform before his ban took effect_ including for those who do not require a gender change and those who had been "stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession_" according to a Pentagon memo dated Feb. 22_ 2018.  On Monday_ officials with Veterans Affairs announced its "initial implementation" of Trump's executive order to end DEI programs and put 60 employees on paid leave.  "Under President Trump_ VA is laser-focused on providing the best possible care and benefits to veterans_ their families_ caregivers and survivors_" said VA director of Media Affairs Morgan Ackley.  "We are proud to have abandoned the divisive DEI policies of the past and pivot back to VA's core mission."

284547824,Justin Baldoni appeared to be heard apologizing to Blake Lively in a lengthy 2 a.m. voice note after they allegedly disagreed over the “It Ends With Us” rooftop scene.  “Hey_ Blake … hopefully_ this does not wake you up_” the “Jane the Virgin” star was allegedly heard saying in the message sent around April 2023_ per audio obtained by the Daily Mail Monday.  “There’s so much I want to say to you_ and I hope that we can FaceTime_ or see each other in person soon … but I’m just going to send you a few thoughts.”  “I want to start with an apology_” Baldoni_ 41_ purportedly said_ explaining that his “heart sank” when he read a text message Lively had sent about “not always [being] good” at ensuring she is seen and instead bowing down to “threatening egos” out of “fear of affecting the ease of the process.”  “I for sure fell short and you worked really hard on that_ and the way you framed it_ and how that made you feel … I just wanted to say thank you for sharing that with me_” the audio continued.   “That takes a lot of trust and vulnerability_ and I feel really grateful that you feel safe enough to tell me that that’s how you feel and share that with me. I f–ked up.”   “One thing you should know about me is that I will admit and apologize when I fail_” Baldoni added_ per the audio. “I am far from perfect. I’m a very flawed man_ as my wife will attest.”  “I’m gonna f–k up. I’m going to say the wrong thing. I’m going to put my foot in my mouth … but I will always apologize and find my way back to center…”  “I’m sorry I made you feel that way. That must have felt terrible. I will for sure do better. That was not my best weekend and I should’ve given it more time.”   Baldoni purportedly also discussed when Lively_ 37_ invited him over to her and Ryan Reynolds’ New York City penthouse_ where Taylor Swift was present and allegedly raved over her script rewrites.   According to the filmmaker’s $400 million defamation and extortion lawsuit against the “Gossip Girl” alum and Reynolds_ Lively referred to her husband and the 14-time Grammy winner as “absolute titans” and “dragons” who will protect her in battle.  “And damn right you got great friends if that’s how you felt and they knew that_” the audio message continued. “We should all have friends like that_ aside from the fact that they are two of the most creative people on the planet. The three of you guys together_ it’s unbelievable. Talk about energy and just a force.”   Baldoni also appeared to insist he didn’t need the “Deadpool” star_ 48_ or Swift_ 35_ to tell him how good Lively’s work was_ allegedly saying in the audio_ “Because [the rewrites are] really good and it’s going to make the movie sing like you said. I’m excited to go through the whole movie with you.”  Per the audio_ the “Five Feet Apart” director shared that he and Lively have successfully built their relationship_ but admitted that communicating via text and voice notes wasn’t his “biggest strength.”   “I love being with people and being in somebody’s face and face to face_” he purportedly said. “I feel like that’s where I excel and I’ve definitely fallen short in our texting … because there is so much to communicate and so much happening.”  “All that to say_ I’m just looking forward to spending time together and I think that’s really going to go a long way for our chemistry_ which I believe is there_ [and] has been there from the start.”  “I was so damn excited when you wanted to do this film_ I felt it in the room when we met and I think it does come from the both of us being so f–king hard-working_ and having a vision and not settling. I’m excited to have a creative partner in that with you.”   Baldoni allegedly shared he had so much more to say to the “A Simple Favor” star and apologized on behalf of “filmmakers and producers” for what she’s been through.  “Those f–kheads_” he said_ per the audio. “I’m just still kinda blown away that this is the industry that we’re in and that you’ve experienced that as a woman.”  “And no I don’t need to say it but … hopefully that’s not going to be the experience with me.”  He also reassured the “Age of Adaline” star that there was “no hesitancy” in sending her the final draft of the script_ which is based on Colleen Hoover’s 2016 book about domestic violence.   “The only reason I didn’t send it today was because I was trying to implement and add your notes into my working draft … I just haven’t had a chance to send it to you_” Baldoni said.  The “My Last Days” producer shared he hopes the movie experience would be “healing” to Lively “in some way_” adding_ “That’s all I want.”  “I want this movie to be commercial just like you and affect people and touch people and I want to walk you through my whole plan and the work we are doing with the domestic violence partner that we found … and just my vision.”  “I just know this can be really really special and it’s going to be special_ and you’re the secret sauce_” he continued_ per the audio.  “I hope you’re feeling better. Give Ryan my love for sending me that_” Baldoni added_ alluding that he also received a text message from Reynolds.   “It means the world to me that you trust me with your feelings and your thoughts. I can’t wait to spend more time with you.”  Reps for Baldoni and Lively weren’t immediately available to Page Six for comment.   The voice memo is the latest update to Baldoni and Lively’s ongoing legal battle after she accused her co-star and director of sexual harassment and retaliation last month.  Baldoni denied the allegations and filed a lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds on Jan. 16.   The famous couple has since requested a gag order but Baldoni’s lawyer_ Bryan Freedman_ has said that he refuses to be “bullied” into silence.
284752524,By CHRIS MEGERIAN_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is pausing federal grants and loans starting on Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s administration begins an across-the-board ideological review of its spending.  The decision by the Republican administration could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research_ education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted.  “The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity_ transgenderism_ and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve_” said a memo from Matthew Vaeth_ the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.  The pause takes effect at 5 p.m. ET_ and it’s unclear from the memo how sweeping it will be.

Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Rose DeLauro_ the top Democrats on the Senate and House appropriations committees_ expressed “extreme alarm” in a letter to Vaeth.  “This Administration’s actions will have far-reaching consequences for nearly all federal programs and activities_ putting the financial security of our families_ our national security_ and the success of our country at risk_” they wrote.

Trump also sat down with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Wednesday_ where the pair discussed issues ranging from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to hurricanes and wildfires under the Biden administration and declaring that his return to the White House serves as evidence that policies from the "radical left" do not work and were rejected by voters.

285016768,WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday will sign the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration's first piece of legislation. It mandates the detention and potential deportation of people in the U.S. illegally who are accused of theft and violent crimes before they've actually been convicted.  The measure swiftly passed the Republican-controlled Congress with some Democratic support_ despite immigrants rights advocates decrying it as extreme enough to possibly trigger mass roundups of people for offenses as minor as shoplifting.   Trump has made a promised crackdown on illegal immigration unprecedented in the nation's history a centerpiece of his political career_ however_ and is now suggesting the law might only be the beginning.   “This shows the potential for additional enforcement bills that will help us crack down on criminal aliens and totally restore the rule of law in our country_" the president said at a conference of House Republicans held at his Doral golf club in Florida.   The law is named for Laken Riley_ a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who went out for a run in February 2024 and was killed by Jose Antonio Ibarra_ a Venezuelan national in the U.S. illegally. Ibarra was found guilty in November and sentenced to life without parole.  “To have a bill of such importance named after her is a great_ a great tribute_” Trump said. “This new form of crime_ criminal_ illegal aliens_ it’s — it’s massive_ the numbers are massive and you add that to the crime we already had.”   The speed at which the act cleared Congress — and the fact that Trump is preparing to triumphantly sign it at the White House surrounded by lawmakers and other supportive_ invited guests just nine days after taking office — adds to its potent political symbolism for conservatives. Critics say the measure is using a tragedy to effectively unleash chaos and cruelty while doing little to fight crime or fix an antiquated federal immigration system that hasn't been overhauled in decades.   Under the Laken Riley Act_ federal officials are required to detain any immigrant arrested or charged with crimes like theft or assaulting a police officer_ or offenses that injure or kill someone. It further gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue the U.S. government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions — potentially allowing the leaders of conservative states to help dictate immigration policy set by Washington.   Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso_ Texas_ amid an unprecedented surge in migration_ and released to pursue his case in immigration court. Federal officials say he was arrested by New York police in August 2023 for child endangerment and released. Police say he was also suspected of theft in Georgia in October 2023 — all of which occurred before Riley's killing.   “This is the right thing to do_” House Speaker Mike Johnson_ R-La._ said after the act cleared the House. “It’s always good when the right thing is also the popular thing.”  Some Democrats_ however_ have questioned the act's constitutionality. Immigrant advocates are bracing for mass detentions that they say will trigger subsequent_ costly construction of immigration lockup facilities to house the people arrested.   “They don’t just get to celebrate. They get to use this for their mass deportation agenda_” Naureen Shah_ deputy director of government affairs in the equality division of the American Civil Liberties Union_ said of the act's supporters.  The ALCU says the act can allow people to be “mandatorily locked up — potentially for years — because at some point in their lives_ perhaps decades ago_ they were accused of nonviolent offenses.”  Hannah Flamm_ interim senior director of policy at the International Refugee Assistance Project_ said the law violates immigrants' basic rights by allowing for detaining people who haven’t been charged with_ much less convicted of_ wrongdoing. Still_ she said_ “The latent fear from the election cycle of looking soft on crime snowballed into aiding and abetting Trump’s total conflation of immigration with crime."  Flamm said the act is likely to be challenged in court on its parameters directing mandatory detentions_ as well as its granting legal standing to state attorneys general in immigration cases and policy. But she also predicted that a need to pay for more immigration detention centers will give advocates a chance to challenge how federal funds are appropriated to cover those costs.   “I think it is pivotal to understand: This bill_ framed as connected to a tragic death_ is pretext to fortify a mass deportation system_” Flamm said.   The signing of the Laken Riley Act follows a flurry of first-week executive orders by Trump that are designed to better seal off the U.S.-Mexico border and eventually move to deport millions of immigrants without permanent U.S. legal status. The new administration has also canceled refugee resettlement and says it may attempt to prosecute local law enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration policies.  “We’re tracking down the illegal alien criminals and we’re detaining them and we’re throwing them the hell out of our country_" Trump said. "We have no apologies_ and we’re moving forward very fast.”
285140786,Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are back at Katz’s Deli — and we’ll have what they’re having.   More than 35 years after When Harry Met Sally introduced one of the most-quoted scenes in rom-com history_ Ryan and Crystal reunited in a Super Bowl commercial for Hellmann’s.   The ad sees the pair reviving the 1989 movie’s title characters at the New York City deli_ where Harry tells Sally_ “I can’t believe they let us back in this place.”   “Why?” Sally asks_ to which he responds_ “Hello …”   “Nobody remembers that_” Sally insists.   They’re_ of course_ referring to the classic movie moment where Harry says he doesn’t believe any of the women he’s slept with have ever faked an orgasm and Sally proceeds to offer a convincing demonstration right in the middle of the restaurant. “I’ll have what she’s having_” deadpans a fellow diner. (Trivia alert: It's actually the director Rob Reiner's mother_ Estelle_ who delivers the now-famous line.)   The ad then shows the duo bite into their respective sandwiches_ but Sally admits hers “isn’t doing it.”   The solution? Sally squeezes a healthy serving of Hellmann’s mayonnaise onto her rye bread_ and signals her approval by re-enacting her famous performance with gusto. “This one’s real_” Billy remarks. Actress Sydney Sweeney makes a cameo to deliver the “I’ll have what she’s having” catchphrase.   Crystal tells PEOPLE the timing was right to revisit the beloved movie_ written by the late Nora Ephron.   “It was our 35th anniversary of the film_ and it's the first time that we've been offered something like that_” he says. “It was a really fun idea_ and the approach was right.”   “They were so respectful of the movie and of the scene too_” Ryan tells PEOPLE of Hellmann’s. “They came to us with just an enormous amount of respect for that_ for the source material and for the characters.”   And as for sitting across the table from each other at the famed N.Y.C. deli once again_ Crystal says_ “It felt the same.”   Ryan remembers the shoot for the original Katz’s scene lasting “all day_” during which she experienced “a lot of trepidation and nerves.”   “Initially_ it was like_ ‘Oh_ what are these sounds going to be?’ All the levels. I don't know if I'm going to get help_” she recalls.   Fortunately_ Reiner offered her plenty of guidance. “Rob had so many significant and interesting sounds to inspire me with_” Ryan says.   Crystal recalls: “He did one and he took me aside and he said_ ‘Oh_ I shouldn't have done that. I just had an orgasm in front of my mother.”   Both actors agreed Sweeney did the line justice in the commercial.   “She's adorable_” Crystal says of the Anyone But You star. “That's a big deal. It's an iconic line and it's a big honor to get to do that. And a heavy burden.”   “It was game and fun and loose and ballsy and just seemed to be having a blast while she was there_” Ryan adds. “She's a completely adorable person.”   The pair also reflected on why the Katz’s scene has continued to resonate in pop culture for more than three decades.   “Back then_ no one had ever attempted to talk about that_” Crystal says_ noting it evolved from a script meeting_ during which the “concept of women faking orgasms” came up. “I think it just took everyone's breath away.”   Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer_ from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.   Ryan says it’s “really just a well-constructed scene.”   “It pays off the way both Sally's funny is behavioral_ Harry's funny is more verbal and reactive_” she explains. “That was important_ how Billy reacted to her. So it just sort of pulled all together in one scene_ everything about the characters and sort of delivered on the promise of the premise.”   “And she teaches him a lesson at the same time_” Crystal adds. “And doesn't care where she is_ doesn't care that people are watching.”   A teaser for the Hellmann’s commercial_ released last week_ paid tribute to Sally’s notoriously detailed ordering style when eating out.   “I didn't know that you could order like that until I played Sally_” Ryan says. “I didn't realize that you could be that specific. When I was in New York_ I never did that. … In L.A._ there was more sort of acceptance of tailoring your order. Now_ of course_ everyone does it.”   “That was a real Nora thing though_” Crystal notes of Ephron.   “She made it more permissible_” Ryan adds.

Tyler Sabapathy_ 18_ was a first-year student at Temple University's College of Public Health_ the university said in a statement. Sabapathy climbed a pole at 15th and Market streets and fell_ sources told CBS News Philadelphia."There are no words that can make sense of it_ and the entire Temple community mourns his passing. Our hearts go out to Tyler's family_ friends_ classmates and all who knew and loved him_" the university said in a statement. A native of Toronto_ Canada_ Sabapathy was majoring in exercise science and sport science and was a member of the school's club gymnastics team. Temple said in a statement students can seek help from Tuttleman Counseling Services and faculty and staff can get support 24/7 from the employee assistance program. Philadelphia police said there were 31 citations for disorderly conduct or failure to disperse and four assaults on police with two arrests Sunday night. Other incidents include a person who shot a gun into the air and two shootings_ and the front of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office was vandalized_ according to police.
284926846,A lawsuit by the National Council of Nonprofits led to a federal judge pausing an order by President Donald Trump to freeze some federal funds in order to root out ideological spending from the budget.   U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan issued the temporary pause in the spending freeze just minutes before it was set to go into effect at 5 p.m. on Tuesday. The administrative stay only applies to already existing programs and will only last until Monday afternoon.   'The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity_ transgenderism_ and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars.'    “It seems like the federal government currently doesn’t actually know the full extent of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause_" said AliKhan in her ruling.   The freeze was communicated to federal departments through a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that explained it was necessary to ensure funds were no longer being used for ideological purposes.   "The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity_ transgenderism_ and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve_" read the memo.  Earlier in the day_ Democrats claimed the spending freeze led to a "constitutional crisis" after payments to the Medicare website portal were reportedly down. The White House later said that there was an unrelated outage at the website portal.   "We must state the truth: this is a constitutional crisis. It’s a massive_ illegal power grab that the House and Senate have a sworn duty to stop_" responded Democratic Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.   Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio praised the ruling on social media.   "Democracy is under attack. President Trump’s unlawful EO to freeze federal funds is an overreach of executive power and a deliberate attack on our nation’s democracy_" she wrote. "A federal judge has already temporarily blocked his efforts_ keeping our checks and balances in place for just a little longer. But make no mistake: this sets a dangerous precedent for our country."  AliKhan was appointed by former President Joe Biden.   Like Blaze News?

285199416,Washington — The top federal prosecutor in South Florida is asking a federal appeals court to toss out the classified documents case against President Trump's former co-defendants_ aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira.Acting U.S. Attorney Hayden O'Byrne made the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Wednesday_ which lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira do not oppose. It's likely the Atlanta-based appeals court will grant the request_ bringing the case initially brought by former special counsel Jack Smith to a close.Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with allegedly helping obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.The prosecution was brought by Smith_ who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort_ Mar-a-Lago_ after leaving the White House four years ago_ and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.Following Mr. Trump's election in November_ Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira.The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win. Should the judges agree to close the case_ a major impediment to the public release of Smith's report summarizing the classified documents investigation would be eliminated. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep the volume of Smith's report that dealt with the case under seal as the appeal progressed. Now_ with the case on the verge of dismissal and Mr. Trump's administration in power_ it remains unclear whether the volume of the report will be released to the public. The first volume of Smith's report_ which involved his investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump stemming from alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election_ was made public just before the president returned to office.Mr. Trump has returned to office with a pledge to end the so-called "weaponization" of the Justice Department. He has since fired roughly a dozen department employees who worked with Smith on the prosecutions of the president.Nauta's lawyer_ Stanley Woodward_ is now serving as a White House lawyer. CBS News previously reported that de Oliveira's attorney_ John Irving_ is under possible consideration for a top job within the Justice Department although a final decision has yet to be made. Irving said in a statement that "Carlos should never have been charged in the first place_ and I have zero doubt that he would have been acquitted at trial. It's nice to see the Justice Department using better judgment these days."
285469610,Marianne Faithfull_ a pioneering artist who transcended “it girl” status in the Sixties for a stunning second act as a singer-songwriter with great depth_ died Thursday at age 78.   “It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer_ songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull_” the singer’s rep said in a statement. “Marianne passed away peacefully in London today_ in the company of her loving family.”  Faithfull became a breakout star in 1964 with her first single_ the ballad “As Tears Go By.” The beloved track would be the first song Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had written together. Although she was only 17 and her voice sounded frail and young_ she sang the lyrics about feeling left out with a conviction that would guide her later work. She continued to score hits throughout the mid Sixties_ before disappearing from the spotlight in a haze of heroin addiction (trials she chronicled in the lyrics to “Sister Morphine_” which the Rolling Stones also recorded).  She reemerged in 1979 with the jaw-dropping Broken English_ an album that drew musically from punk and New Wave and showcased her newfound dark_ sometimes vulgar outlook. Its songs_ like “The Ballad of Lucy Jordan_” “Guilt_” and a cover of John Lennon’s “Working Class Hero_” perfectly fit the way her voice had deepened during her time away. (Faithfull would earn a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.) Over the next 40 years_ she stayed the course_ singing about love and relationships against dramatic_ musical backdrops. In recent years_ she recorded songs by PJ Harvey_ Nick Cave_ Roger Waters_ Leonard Cohen_ and Bob Dylan_ among others. Her most recent album_ Negative Capability_ came out in 2018_ and Rolling Stone lauded it as a “late-career masterwork.”  Thrown into fame at a young age_ controversy overshadowed much of Faithfull’s early career. She was in a relationship with Jagger from 1966 until 1970 and was pilloried by the press after police raided Keith Richards’ flat for drugs and found her nude_ save for a fur bedcover in 1967. Toward the end of the decade_ she was homeless and addicted to heroin. After the death of her son_ she attempted suicide. She eventually cleaned up in the mid-Eighties_ just before redefining herself again with the 1987’s jazzy_ cabaret-influenced Strange Weather_ which featured a new rendition of “As Tears Go By.”  In recent years_ Faithfull battled a number of health setbacks. In addition to a hepatitis-C diagnosis_ she received treatment for breast cancer in 2016_ and underwent shoulder-replacement surgery two years later.  At various points of her career_ she revisited “As Tears Go By” several times_ and marveled in an 2014 interview with Rolling Stone about how profound the song was. “I still sing it every night_” she said. “I still think it’s a beautiful song. I’m still very grateful that Mick and Keith gave it to me and wrote it for me. I suddenly really understood it myself when I was about 40_ when I realized it was another version of [poet Alfred_ Lord Tennyson’s ballad] ‘The Lady of Shalott.’ It hit me during one of my moments of clarity_ which I’ve told you seem to happen periodically. That moment of clarity was when I got clean.”  This story is developing.

U.S. Figure Skating did not confirm the number of its members on board and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Russian state news agencies also reported that three former figure skaters from Russia were on the plane.  The U.S. national championships are held annually in different cities around the country. Leading up to the competition_ skaters must compete in qualifying rounds at regional competitions. U.S. Figure Skating was founded in 1921 and is based in Colorado Springs. It comprises both amateur and professional skating clubs and has almost 900 member clubs.  “We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters_ along with their families_ friends and coaches_ are understood to be among those on board_” the International Skating Union said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy. Figure skating is more than a sport — it’s a close-knit family — and we stand together.”  Tariq Panja contributed reporting.

285252762,ARLINGTON_ Va. — Everyone aboard an American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members that collided with an Army helicopter was feared dead in what was likely to be the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost a quarter century_ officials said Thursday.  At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the midair collision Wednesday night when the helicopter apparently flew in the path of the jet as it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington_ D.C._ officials said.  Crews were still searching for other casualties but did not believe there were any survivors_ which would make it the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years.  ''We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation_'' said John Donnelly_ the fire chief in the nation's capital. ''We don't believe there are any survivors.''  The body of the plane was found upside down in three sections in waist-deep water. The wreckage of the helicopter was also found. Donnelly said first responders on Thursday were searching an area of the Potomac River as far south as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge_ roughly 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the airport.  There was no immediate word on the cause of the collision_ but officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet coming from Wichita_ Kansas_ with U.S. and Russian figure skaters and others aboard_ was making a routine landing when the helicopter flew into its path.  ''On final approach into Reagan National it collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise normal approach_" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said. "At this time we don't know why the military aircraft came into the path of the ... aircraft.''  Three soldiers were onboard the helicopter during a training flight_ an Army official previously said.
285261802,We're following the confirmation hearings for the incoming Trump administration. See our full politics coverage_ and follow NPR's Trump's Terms podcast or sign up for our Politics newsletter to stay up to date.   Who: Kash Patel  Patel is a former public defender_ federal prosecutor and veteran of the first Trump administration. He's also a fierce critic of the Justice Department and the FBI.  Nominated for: director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation_ part of the Justice Department  What this role does: The director oversees the FBI_ which is the United States' premier law enforcement agency_ and the more than 35_000 people who work there. The FBI investigates federal crimes_ everything from terrorism and violent crime to civil rights and public corruption.  Watch Patel's Senate confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee_ set to begin Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET:  In less than a decade_ Kash Patel has risen from a largely unknown congressional aide to become a MAGA-world fixture. He has held senior national security jobs_ sold self-branded merchandise online and written a children's book called The Plot Against the King_ featuring a wizard named Kash and a king named Donald.  Patel is now President Trump's pick to lead the FBI_ the country's premier law enforcement agency_ which is responsible for everything from catching terrorists and spies to investigating cyberattacks and public corruption.  On Thursday_ Patel is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee_ where Democrats are expected to press him about his qualifications to lead the bureau and whether he can — or even wants to — maintain the FBI's traditional independence from the White House.  Those questions are fueled by Patel's fierce loyalty to Trump but also by the long list of Patel's own past statements about rooting out the "deep state" and going after Trump's perceived enemies_ including at the FBI_ at the Justice Department and in the media.  Those comments also dovetail with Trump's own statements during the presidential campaign about seeking vengeance against his opponents.  Republicans_ who hold the majority in the Senate_ have largely been supportive of Patel's nomination_ and he can win confirmation with only GOP support while still losing three Republican votes.  The president and his supporters accuse the FBI and the Justice Department of being weaponized in recent years against conservatives_ and they view Patel as someone who will put the FBI on the correct course.  The Biden Justice Department rejected those allegations_ noting that prosecutors brought cases against President Biden's own son as well as powerful Democratic members of Congress.  Patel's rise   The FBI director's job comes with a 10-year term_ although neither of Patel's immediate predecessors served that full term. Trump fired James Comey in 2017 and replaced him with Christopher Wray.  After Trump's 2024 election win_ he made clear that Wray would not be allowed to stay and nominated Patel to replace him. Wray left before Trump's inauguration.  Patel's résumé is not typical for an FBI director. Wray_ for example_ had run the Criminal Division at the Justice Department_ while Comey had previously served as U.S. attorney in Manhattan and as deputy attorney general_ the No. 2 job in the department.  Patel_ in contrast_ worked as a public defender in Florida before working as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division for a few years.  In 2017_ he moved to the House Intelligence Committee_ where he was a top aide to the top Republican on the panel_ Rep. Devin Nunes of California. It was here that Patel gained attention for helping investigate the investigators who were probing possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  His efforts raised questions about failings in the FBI's work on the probe_ and it made Patel a hero among Trump supporters. It also helped him land a job on Trump's National Security Council and later as a top aide to the director of national intelligence and to the secretary of defense.  Toward the end of the first Trump administration_ the president tried to install Patel in top positions at the CIA and the FBI but backed down in the face of opposition from senior leaders at the Justice Department_ Congress and elsewhere.  After Trump's 2020 election loss_ Patel became a frequent guest on right-wing podcasts.  It is in those podcast episodes that Patel has made many of his controversial statements. He has railed against what he calls the deep state_ which he views as people in senior national security roles who he claims have weaponized the justice system and intelligence agencies and pose a threat to democracy.  In one appearance on Shawn Ryan's podcast_ Patel vowed to shut down the FBI headquarters in Washington_ D.C._ "on Day 1 and reopening the next day as a museum of the deep state."  "And I'd take the 7_000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals_" he added. "Go be cops. You're cops— go be cops. Go chase down murderers and rapists and drug dealers and violent offenders."  He also wrote a book called Government Gangsters that includes a list of deep state actors whom Patel's critics have described as an enemies list.  All of this sets up what could be a tense confirmation hearing.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal_ a Democrat from Connecticut and a Senate Judiciary Committee member_ called Patel "unqualified and unprepared" to lead the FBI.  "Anybody who has an enemies list that would be targets for retribution_ anyone who wants to shut down the FBI here in Washington_ anyone who wants to purge an agency that has to investigate impartially and objectively_ is unfit for this job_" Blumenthal said.  Blumenthal said he met with Patel ahead of the hearing and pressed him on his statements about using the FBI as a political weapon. He said Patel responded with "totally unpersuasive assurances."  "What he offered in these vague assurances — was 'Oh_ I would never do anything like that' — but he has said he would do exactly that_ so he's going to have to explain himself_" Blumenthal said.  Republicans_ meanwhile_ appear to have largely swung behind Patel's nomination.  Sen. John Cornyn_ R-Texas_ who has met with Patel as well to discuss his potential confirmation_ acknowledged that for some people_ some of Patel's past statements could be controversial.  "Obviously_ Kash was engaging in a lot of political rhetoric_ and I think he understands the difference between that and actually doing the job at the DOJ and the FBI_" Cornyn said. "And I think the FBI needs a course correction_ and he's certainly capable of doing that."
285464592,Microsoft has announced that Forza Horizon 5 is crossing the console divide from Xbox Series X to PS5.  In a news release_ Microsoft pegged Forza Horizon 5 for release on PS5 "this spring" but didn't nail down a specific release date. The racing game will arrive on PS5 with all of the same content and DLC as the Xbox and PC version_ and cross-play has been confirmed.  In addition_ there's a new update called Horizon Realms coming to all platforms that "will give players the chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds_ alongside some other surprises."  Released in 2021_ Forza Horizon 5 brings all the thrills of racing to an open-world format based in Mexico and adds new modes such as hide-and-seek. We were pretty keen on it upon release and gave it a perfect score in our Forza Horizon 5 review.  "Forza Horizon 5 is a stunning and beautifully crafted entry in the series that's full of memorable races_ creativity_ and fantastic additions_" we said_ also calling it "Playground Games' most exciting and beautifully crafted entry yet." No pressure for Fable 4 or anything like that_ then.  Over the past 12 months_ Microsoft has softened its stance on Xbox exclusives_ with various older games like Hi-Fi Rush and Grounded jumping to consoles like the PS5_ Nintendo Switch_ and so on. Even newer games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have been released with less exclusivity in mind_ though PlayStation fans are still waiting on that one.  Speaking in a recent interview_ Xbox boss Phil Spencer explained that "there is no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game" when asked about Starfield's future platform plans.  "Our strategy is to allow our games to be available_" he said "Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform_ but to keep games off of other platforms_ that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."  We're still waiting for Starfield to cross the console divide_ but Forza Horizon 5? No longer.

285276876,By DAVID KLEPPER_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — Tulsi Gabbard_ President Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence_ is expected to face tough questions from lawmakers Thursday over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria’s now-deposed leader.  The back-and-forth during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee could reveal whether she has successfully assuaged concerns from lawmakers of both parties — or whether worries about her experience and background will sink her nomination to oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.  Gabbard_ a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii_ is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who deployed twice to the Middle East and ran for president in 2020. She has no formal intelligence experience_ however_ and has never run a government agency or department.  It’s Gabbard’s comments_ however_ that have posed the biggest challenge to her confirmation. Gabbard has repeatedly echoed Russian propaganda used to justify the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a corrupt autocrat.  She’s been accused of spreading Russian disinformation by Republican lawmakers and has even won praise in Russian state-controlled media.  A 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad is another point of contention. Assad was recently deposed as his country’s leader following a brutal civil war in which he was accused of using chemical weapons. Following her visit_ Gabbard faced criticism that she was legitimizing a dictator and then more questions when she said she was skeptical that Assad had used chemical weapons.  As a lawmaker_ Gabbard sponsored legislation that would have repealed a key surveillance program known as Section 702_ which allows authorities to collect the communications of suspected terrorists overseas.  Gabbard said the program could be violating the rights of Americans whose communications are swept up inadvertently_ but national security officials say the program has saved lives.  She now says she supports the program_ noting new safeguards designed to protect Americans’ privacy.  While lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about Gabbard’s nomination_ Republicans have increasingly come to support her. Given thin Republican margins in the Senate_ she will need almost all GOP senators to vote yes in order to win confirmation.  Sen. Tom Cotton_ chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee_ said that while he understands there are questions about Gabbard’s past views_ questions about her loyalty to the U.S. are inappropriate.  “She’s passed five different background checks. I reviewed the latest one. It’s clean as a whistle_” the Arkansas Republican said on “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences. I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard’s patriotism or her integrity.”
285282446,KHAN YOUNIS_ Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants freed eight hostages on Thursday in the latest release since a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took hold earlier this month. Israel was expected to release another 110 Palestinian prisoners.  The release was delayed by a chaotic scene in which a crowd of Palestinians surrounded and jeered at hostages as they were turned over to the Red Cross.  The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas_ whose Oct. 7_ 2023_ attack into Israel sparked the fighting. It has held despite a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages were released.  The first hostage_ female Israeli soldier Agam Berger_ was released in northern Gaza. Hours later_ a chaotic scene unfolded as thousands of people pressed around a handover site in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis_ in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.  Footage showed Arbel Yehoud_ a 29-year-old hostage_ looking stunned as she was led through the crowd by militants toward waiting Red Cross vehicles.  Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived with a convoy in a show of force_ and thousands of people gathered to watch_ some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Many in the crowd shouted and surrounded Yehoud as masked militants pushed people away and escorted her through.  Red Cross vehicles were then delayed as they tried to drive away. The Israeli army later announced the Red Cross had confirmed it had the freed hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the “shocking” scene” and called on international mediators to prevent similar events in the future.  Hamas had earlier handed Berger_ 20_ to the Red Cross after parading her in front of a crowd in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza. The Israeli government later release footage of Berger hugging and crying with her parents.  Berger was among five young_ female soldiers abducted in the Oct. 7 attack. The other four were released on Saturday.  People cheered_ clapped and whistled at a square in Tel Aviv where supporters of the hostages watched Berger’s handover on big screens next to a large clock that’s counted the days the hostages have been in captivity. Some held signs saying: “Agam we’re waiting for you at home.”  The other two Israelis released Thursday are Yehoud and Gadi Moses_ an 80-year-old man. Five Thai nationals were freed_ but were not been officially identified.  A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas’ attack. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight Thais remain in captivity_ two of whom are believed to be dead.  Of the people set to be released from prisons in Israel_ 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Zakaria Zubeidi_ a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later_ is also among those set to be released.  Israel said Yehoud was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not.  The United States_ Egypt and Qatar_ which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations_ resolved the dispute with an agreement that Yehoud would be released Thursday. Another three hostages_ all men_ are set to be freed Saturday along with dozens more Palestinian prisoners.  On Monday_ Israel began allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza_ the most heavily destroyed part of the territory_ and hundreds of thousands streamed back. Many found only mounds of rubble where their homes had been.  Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder  In the first phase of the ceasefire_ Hamas is set to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages_ including women_ children_ older adults and sick or wounded men_ in exchange for nearly 2_000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead.  Palestinians have cheered the release of the prisoners_ who they widely see as heroes who have sacrificed for the cause of ending Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state.  Israeli forces have meanwhile pulled back from most of Gaza_ allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance.  The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.  Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas_ even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase.  Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  Tens of thousands killed  Hamas started the war when it sent thousands of fighters storming into Israel. The militants killed some 1_200 people_ mostly civilians_ and abducted around 250.  Israel’s ensuing air and ground war among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. More than 47_000 Palestinians have been killed_ over half of them women and children_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry_ which does not say how many of the dead were militants.  The Israeli military says it killed over 17_000 fighters_ without providing evidence_ and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense residential neighborhoods and put military infrastructure near homes_ schools and mosques.  The Israeli offensive has transformed entire neighborhoods into mounds of gray rubble_ and it’s unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt. Around 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced_ often multiple times_ with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps or shuttered schools.  Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah_ Gaza Strip_ and Krauss from Dubai_ United Arab Emirates. Associated Press writer Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv_ Israel contributed.

285758932,By PAUL WISEMAN AP Economics Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) — The 25% tax that President Donald Trump plans to slap on imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday could drive up the price of everything from gasoline and pickup trucks_ to Super Bowl party guacamole dip.  The tariffs would also invite retaliation. Doug Ford_ the premier of Ontario_ has already vowed to counterpunch by pulling American alcohol off store shelves in the Canadian province – no idle threat; Canada is the world’s No. 2 market for America’s distilled spirits (behind the 27-nation European Union).  Trump’s tariffs threaten to blow up the trade agreement he himself negotiated with America’s neighbors in his first term. His U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement – “the fairest_ most balanced_ and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law_‘’ Trump once declared -- was supposed to bring predictability to North American trade_ giving businesses the confidence to make investments.  But when it comes to the self-proclaimed “Tariff Man_‘’ Trump and his passion for plastering taxes on foreign goods_ nothing is predictable_ and nothing is ever really settled.  “Tariffs at those levels and at that scope would effectively destroy the agreement that Trump himself negotiated and always brags about_‘’ said Scott Lincicome_ a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.  The president says the 25% levies are designed to pressure America’s two neighbors to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States.  Michael Robinet of S&P Global Mobility and many other analysts suspect the tariff threat is also designed to get Canada and Mexico to go along with America’s demands for changes to the USMCA when it comes up for renewal next year.  Robinet_ executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global_ said he doubts that Trump will go ahead with 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports – what he calls a “shock-to-the-system'' approach that would freeze the North American economy in a “Tariff Winter.‘’ Instead_ Robinet said_ Trump might postpone or phase in the tariffs or initially exempt some industries to show Canada and Mexico how much worse things could get if he doesn’t get his way.  Trump pressured Mexico and Canada into agreeing to the USMCA five years ago_ partly to narrow the United States' big trade deficit – the gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys.  It hasn’t worked out that way.  The U.S. deficit in the trade of goods of Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023 (the last full year for which numbers are available). That is partly because Mexico has replaced China_ locked in an ongoing trade war with the United States_ as the source of many U.S. imports – furniture_ textiles_ shoes_ laptops_ computer servers.  The trade gap in goods with Canada has ballooned_ too: From $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023. The deficit largely reflects America’s imports of Canadian energy.  “The USMCA has not met the goals that Trump set forth for it. Our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico is bigger than it was_ considerably_‘’ said Lori Wallach_ director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime critic of America’s free trade pacts. “A lot of jobs have been offshored to Mexico since USMCA.‘’  When the USMCA comes up for renewal next year_ the U.S. is expected to press for rules that would do more to encourage factories to produce in the United States. And it could seek a crackdown on Chinese goods being sent through Mexico to the United States to evade tariffs that Trump and President Joe Biden imposed on Beijing.  The United States now does far more business – exports and imports alike – with both Canada and Mexico than it does with China. In 2023_ U.S. trade of both goods and services with Canada and Mexico came to more than $1.8 trillion_ compared with $643 billion with China. Because of USMCA – and the regional trade deal it replaced in 2020 – most products cross the region’s borders tariff-free.  The threatened 25% tariffs are causing heartburn in corporate boardrooms. If Trump goes ahead with his threat_ tariffs would surge from $1.3 billion to $132 billion a year on Mexico’s imports to the United States and from $440 million to $107 billion on Canada’s_ according to the tax and consulting firm PwC.  And no one knows if Trump will really pull the trigger or how long the tariffs would stay in place if he does. “It’s really thrown industry into this turmoil of anxiety_” said trade lawyer Chandri Navarro_ senior counsel at Baker & McKenzie. “What industry likes is certainty. You’re making production decisions_ supply chain decisions_ purchasing decisions five years out.‘’  Trump views tariffs as a fix-it for most of what ails the economy. He says they raise money for cuts in income and corporate taxes_ encourage companies to move production to the United States and offer useful leverage in pressuring other countries to make concessions on trade and other issues.  Trump administration officials also say critics of potential tariffs shouldn’t view them in isolation_ arguing that their other policies_ including lowering taxes and easing regulations_ will strengthen the economy.  Companies are scrambling to prepare. Some bought goods and shipped them to the United States ahead of time to beat the tariffs. Others are calculating how much of the cost they can pass along to their customers. “Unfortunately_ it’s going to impact a lot of consumers_‘’ said Dave Evans_ co-founder and CEO of Fictiv_ a San Francisco company that helps clients manage their supply chains in plastics and metals. “We saw this in his first term. A tariff isn’t fully absorbed by the companies.‘’  Canada and Mexico are bracing_ too. Chrystia Freeland_ the former finance minister who represented Canada in USMCA negotiations_ has called for retaliation if Trump moves ahead with tariffs. “Being smart means retaliating where it hurts_” said Freeland_ who is running to replace prime minister Justin Trudeau. “Our counterpunch must be dollar-for-dollar — and it must be precisely and painfully targeted: Florida orange growers_ Wisconsin dairy farmers_ Michigan dishwasher manufacturers_ and much more.”  Likewise_ Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised in November that “for every tariff_ there will be a response in kind.‘’  Associated Press Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed this story.

285557066,NEW YORK -- Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men's figure skater in history. He was one of his sport's greatest innovators and promoters.  Button_ winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships_ died Thursday_ said his son_ Edward_ who did not provide a cause. He was 95.  As an entrepreneur and broadcaster_ Button promoted skating and its athletes_ transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter Olympics.  "Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport_" Scott Hamilton said. "There wasn't a skater after Dick who wasn't helped by him in some way."  Button's impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men's champion - and his country's youngest at age 16 - when that competition returned in 1946. Two years later_ he took the title at the St. Moritz Olympics_ competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men's event.  "By the way_ that jump had a cheat on it_" Button told the U.S. Olympic Committee website. "But listen_ I did it and that was what counted."  That began his dominance of international skating_ and U.S. amateur sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 - no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001.  In 1952_ while a Harvard student_ he won a second gold at the Oslo Games_ making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after_ he won a fifth world title_ then gave up his eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an amateur/professional division at the time.  "I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater_" said Button_ who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. "I was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating_ and that was very important to me."  With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst_ viewers got to learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper tumbling down the slope.  "Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice_" 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in Button's autobiography. "He made the words 'lutz' and 'salchow' part of our everyday vocabulary."  After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships_ which then were canceled_ Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on "Wide World." That's when he joined the network as a commentator.  Button's death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world_ Wednesday night's crash of an American Airlines flight that collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside Washington_ D.C._ killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters_ their mothers_ and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating community.  Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor.  He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for years_ attracting many top names in the sport - Hamilton_ Torvill and Dean_ Kristi Yamaguchi_ Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt.  Button's Candid Productions_ formed 1959_ also produced such made-for-TV programs as "Battle of the Network Stars." He also dabbled in acting_ but the rink was his realm.  "Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits_" said Johnny Weir_ the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst. "He told it like it was_ even when his opinion wasn't a popular one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him_ and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches.  "I think that is something very special about commentating figure skating. As an athlete_ we rarely have an opportunity to speak_ and we rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like Mr. Button."

285557444,In the latest amid the ongoing legal saga between Blake Lively and her It Ends With Us costar Justin Baldoni_ the actress and her husband Ryan Reynolds told a federal judge that they will move to dismiss Baldoni‘s defamation lawsuit.   According to Variety_ the couple’s lawyers filed the notice Thursday in compliance with Judge Lewis Liman’s order_ which lays out how the federal case will proceed.    Earlier this month_ Baldoni filed a $400 million lawsuit against Lively_ accusing her of trying to “destroy” him with false allegations of sexual misconduct. The complaint_ filed in New York’s Southern District_ accuses Lively_ Reynolds_ publicist Leslie Sloane_ and her company_ Vision PR_ of defamation_ extortion_ and invasion of privacy. Along with Baldoni_ the suit also lists his film studio_ Wayfarer_ its chief executive_ Jamey Heath_ and PR reps Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel as plaintiffs.   His suit arrived after Lively filed a precursor complaint with the California Civil Rights Department and accused Baldoni of sexually harassing her on set and launching a smear campaign against her. Baldoni’s lawyer_ Bryan Freedman_ denied the allegations at the time and claimed that the actress’ filing was an attempt to “fix her negative reputation.” Lively brought an official lawsuit on Dec. 31.   A pretrial conference was scheduled on Feb. 3 and is set to focus on attorney conduct and pretrial publicity. In a letter_ lawyers for Lively and Reynolds previously accused Freedman and Wayfarer of making prejudicial comments to the media and trying to taint the jury pool with a website including what they called “strategically selected documents and communications” between Lively and Baldoni.    “All these motions to dismiss are just yet another attempt by Ms. Lively_ Ryan Reynolds and Leslie Sloan to hide and delay the discovery of the hundreds of pages of true facts and well-documented information that we remain dedicated to providing publicly_ with full transparency_” Freedman told Rolling Stone in response to the new filing. “We expect such motions to be denied and_ in the meantime_ stand ready to oppose each and every one of them.”   Along with the expected pretrial hearings and developments_ Liman slated the trial to begin March 9_ 2026.

285554574,The Senate confirmed Doug Burgum as interior secretary late Thursday after President Trump tapped the North Dakota billionaire to spearhead the Republican administration's ambitions to boost fossil fuel production.The vote was 79-18. More than half of Senate Democrats joined all 53 Republicans in voting for Burgum.Burgum_ 68_ is an ultra-wealthy software industry entrepreneur who came from a small North Dakota farming community_ where he worked at his family's grain elevator.He served two terms as governor of the oil-rich state and launched a presidential campaign in 2023_ but dropped out months later and quickly endorsed Trump.Trump also picked Burgum to chair a new National Energy Council that's tasked with achieving American "energy dominance." He would have a seat on the National Security Council — a first for the interior secretary.His directive from Mr. Trump is to make it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources_ including from public lands. That raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.Burgum eagerly assisted the energy industry during his time as governor_ when he was also profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies_ according to records obtained by The Associated Press.During his confirmation hearing_ Burgum said the U.S. can use energy development as leverage to promote peace and to lower consumer costs.He raised concerns about the reliability of renewable power sources promoted under former President Joe Biden_ and said the U.S. needs to generate more electricity from sources such as coal and nuclear that can run constantly.Democrats in response accused the Trump administration of abandoning an "all of the above" energy policy to favor fossil fuels."They said wind is dead on the offshore. They are trying to do as much of this as possible to create demand for coal_ for fossil gas_" Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said during a Thursday floor speech.Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso_ the second-ranking Republican in the Senate_ said Burgum would rightfully prioritize energy innovation over regulation."He's going to take the common-sense action of unlocking our lands for oil and for gas production_" Barrasso said. He added that more than 600_000 acres of land in Wyoming have been approved for energy production but were not offered for development by the Biden administration.The U.S. currently produces more crude oil than any nation in history_ according to the Energy Information Administration. More cost-effective technology in recent decades drove drilling booms in states including New Mexico_ Texas and North Dakota_ where vast expanses of rural farmland have been industrialized by oil and gas companies.The booms brought billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and federal governments. But burning those fuels is also unleashing immense volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say is warming the planet.The Interior Department has jurisdiction over a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.The interior secretary also oversees the National Park Service_ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service_ Bureau of Indian Affairs_ Bureau of Land Management and other subagencies.Burgum succeeds Deb Haaland_ who under Biden sharply scaled back oil and gas sales and promoted solar and wind projects on federal lands.Trump made energy development a centerpiece of his first term and is again vowing to abolish restrictions on the industry that are intended to protect the environment and public health.Burgum_ during his hearing earlier this month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee_ suggested to lawmakers that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels could be captured to neutralize their contribution to global warming.Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged even as climate change becomes increasingly urgent.During Haaland's tenure at the Interior Department_ officials also reversed actions taken during Trump's first term that weakened protections for imperiled species while making it easier for private developers to pursue projects on public lands.Republicans in Congress have said they plan to again seek changes to rules on endangered species and they want Burgum to help.Burgum says federal lands can be used for many purposes including recreation_ logging and oil and gas production that can lift local economies."Not every acre of federal land is a national park or a wilderness area_" he told lawmakers.

286056590,The president is expected to eventually sign an executive order putting the tariffs into effect and could do so retroactively. But the lack of clarity surrounding what_ exactly_ Mr. Trump planned to impose created even more uncertainty for global businesses on Saturday morning.  U.S. stock markets closed lower on Friday amid anxiety among investors about the fallout from the tariffs.  Lobbying groups for industries such as retail and agriculture_ which could be among the hardest hit by retaliation from America’s trading partners_ were scrambling for information about the levies but remained in the dark.  Mr. Trump said that the new tariffs would be on top of existing ones on products from Canada_ Mexico and China_ although oil imports could face a lower 10 percent tariff.  Democrats were poised on Saturday to point to the tariffs as an early example of Mr. Trump’s mismanagement of the economy_ arguing that he was already taking steps that would raise prices on consumers.

There are hundreds of teams around the world nicknamed EAGLEs_ FALCONs and HAWKs_ just as there are Bears_ Lions and Tigers – and not so many prepared to be called “the cats” or “house flies”.  It’s all very macho. But perhaps I’m only saying this because the football/soccer team I support – Brighton & Hove Albion – are nicknamed the Seagulls_ a type of bird that’s not so much known for sweeping majestically from the sky to hunt its prey as it is for stealing fries and pooping on shoulders.

286271896,U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday imposed long-threatened tariffs on imports from Canada_ Mexico and China — and it didn't take long for the countries to respond.  Trump signed an order slapping 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada_ and a 10% duty on Chinese imports_ due to start on Tuesday. Energy resources from Canada face a lower_ 10% tariff to "minimize any disruptive effects we might have on gasoline and home heating oil prices_" according to a senior administration official.  In the executive order_ Trump said that if the countries — the U.S.'s three-largest trading partners — retaliate_ it could be met with an "increase or expand in scope" of the duties already imposed.  In a post on X_ Trump said the duties had been imposed "because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens_ including fentanyl."  The U.S. does about $1.6 trillion in business each year with Canada_ Mexico and China. The tariffs are expected to be used as both bargaining chips and methods to effect foreign policy changes — specifically regarding immigration and drug trade issues — by the Trump administration.  Reaction from one of the three countries was swift and decisive_ while the others appeared to take more of a wait-and-see approach to Trump's tariffs. Here is a look at their responses.
286165856,WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army on Saturday released the name of the third soldier who died Wednesday when an Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet near Reagan National Airport in D.C.  Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach_ of Durham_ N.C._ served as an Army aviation officer since July 2019. Her awards include an Army commendation medal and an achievement medal.  In a statement released by the Army_ her family said she was a distinguished military graduate in ROTC at the University of North Carolina_ and was in the top 20% of cadets nationwide. They said she had more than 450 hours of flight time_ and earned “certification as a pilot-in-command after extensive testing by the most senior and experienced pilots in her battalion.”  The family also noted that she served as a certified sexual harassment/assault response and prevention victim advocate and hoped to become a physician when she got out of the Army.  “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Rebecca. She was a bright star in all our lives. She was kind_ generous_ brilliant_ funny_ ambitious and strong. No one dreamed bigger or worked harder to achieve her goals_” the statement said_ adding_ “we request that you please respect our privacy as we grieve this devastating loss.”  The names of the two other soldiers were released on Friday_ but Lobach’s name was withheld at the time at the request of her family. The others were: Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara_ 28_ of Lilburn_ Georgia_ who was the crew chief_ and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves_ 39_ of Great Mills_ Maryland_ who was a pilot.  There has been no specific explanation from the Army for the one-day delay in releasing her name. But while the investigation into the crash has only just begun_ President Donald Trump has publicly blamed the helicopter for flying at too high an altitude. And he issued a lengthy critique about an FAA diversity hiring initiative —particularly regarding air traffic controllers — saying they eroded flight safety.  No evidence has emerged that rules seeking to diversify the FAA played any role in the collision.  (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

286186346,PALM BEACH_ Fla. (The Hill) — President Trump on Saturday imposed significant tariffs on Canada_ Mexico and China_ a White House spokesperson said_ following through on a long-standing pledge and potentially setting off a trade war with the United States’ top trading partners.  “Tariffs on imports from Canada_ Mexico_ and China are SIGNED!” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields posted on the social media platform X.  Bloomberg reported that Trump was imposing a 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada_ as well as a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Canadian energy imports will only be tariffed at 10 percent.  For months_ the president has vowed to impose tariffs on the three countries as he called on them to do more to crack down on the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States.  Trump has signaled Saturday’s announcement may just be the first step in imposing widespread tariffs_ potentially setting off a cascading trade war. Trump told reporters Friday he would announce tariffs in the coming weeks on steel and aluminum_ pharmaceuticals_ oil and gas_ semiconductor chips and imports from the European Union broadly.  Experts have repeatedly warned that tariffs could lead to higher costs that companies will pass onto consumers.   The Tax Foundation_ a nonpartisan think tank_ estimated Trump’s tariffs announced Saturday would result in what amounts to an average tax increase of $830 per household in the U.S.  Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) warned in a statement late Friday that certain tariffs on Canadian imports “will impose a significant burden on many families_ manufacturers_ the forest products industry_ small businesses_ lobstermen_ and agricultural producers.”  While Trump has acknowledged there could be “short-term” disruptions because of his tariffs_ he has insisted they will strengthen the economy in the long term by bringing back domestic production.  Mexico and Canada have promised swift and thorough retaliation in recent weeks as Trump has threatened tariffs. Trump initially promised tariffs on the first day of his presidency_ but later moved the date back to Feb. 1.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was expected to announce the country’s response on Saturday night_ according to CTV.  Ontario premier Doug Ford said Friday that Canada was ready for a trade fight.  “[Trump] sat in his oval office and mused about tariffs on Canada. He says they’re coming tomorrow_” Ford said. “Retaliatory tariffs by the federal government are the tip of the spear … Canada has so much of what America needs_ what their military and economy depend on – high grade nickel and other critical minerals.”  Retaliatory tariffs during the first Trump trade war in 2018 with China were targeted largely at agri-business.  “Agriculture is generally the first target generally because there are other sources_” Bill Reinsch_ chair of international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies_ told The Hill. “It strikes at one of the strongest areas of Trump’s support. In 2018_ what he ended up having to do was_ he basically bought off all the farmers.”  Another sector that could be hit hard by the tariffs is autos. Auto production has been integrated across U.S._ Canadian and Mexican borders since the big international trade deals of the 1990s.  “The biggest loser … will be the auto industry because so many things go back and forth so many times. If they charge a tariff every time something crosses a border_ you’re talking about something that adds up very quickly_” Reinsch said.  Tobias Burns contributed.

Bey triumphed in the category over LPs by Chris Stapleton (Higher)_ Kacey Musgraves (Deeper Well)_ Post Malone (F-1 Trillion) and Lainey Wilson (Whirlwind). Taylor Swift presented the award. In her acceptance speech_ Beyoncé said_ “Wow_ I really was not expecting this. Wow. I want to thank God. Oh my God! That I’m able to still do what I love after so many years. Oh my God. I’d like to thank all the incredible country artists that accepted this album. We worked so hard on it. I think sometimes genre is a code word to keep us in our place as artists_ and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about and to stay persistent. Wow. I’d like to thank my beautiful family_ all of the artists that were collaborators_ thank you; this album wouldn’t have been without you.

Upon revealing the artwork for Cowboy Carter_ back in March_ Beyoncé spoke of the criticism she’s faced while seeking acceptance within country music. Earlier this evening_ Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus won the 2025 Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for the Cowboy Carter track “II Most Wanted.” They beat out Brothers Osborne (“Break Mine”)_ Dan + Shay (“Bigger Houses”)_ Kelsea Ballerini & Noah Kahan (“Cowboys Cry Too”)_ and Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen (“I Had Some Help”).

286426814,Dave Portnoy had a savage reaction to Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori’s shockingly bare 2025 Grammy Awards ensemble.  “I hate Kayne so much. #grammy_” the Barstool Sports founder posted via X alongside a photo of the couple making their red carpet debut on Sunday at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

Why does he want her looking like this in front of everyone?” one of many critics commented beneath the media personality’s post.  “Who would parade his wife or girlfriend like that??? SICK!” someone else exclaimed.  “That is so pathetic. Anything for attention_” a third dissenter remarked.  “how is this even legal_” another user wondered. As it turns out_ Page Six is told police officers escorted the pair out after the stunt.  Though one person pointed out that “kanye has always been a controversial figure_” someone else argued_ “Ngl even for Kanye this is wild.”  Censori — who went from the Yeezy founder’s employee to muse to spouse — arrived for music’s biggest night wearing a black floor-length fur coat.  While posing for photographers_ however_ Censori_ 30_ turned around and dropped her coat — while jaws dropped in the process.  Her entire butt was exposed_ which ended up looking like child’s play after she turned back around and put everything on display.  The Australia native let her body be the star as she went jewelry-free_ kept her makeup to a minimum and wore her dark brown hair slicked back in a low bun.  After posing for a few solo shots_ Censori grabbed her husband’s hand_ and the duo exited the carpet.  Despite his rocky relationship with the Recording Academy_ West_ 47_ has been nominated for 76 Grammys and won 24 throughout his decades-long career.  The father of four — who married Censori in December 2022_ just one month after finalizing his divorce from Kardashian — scored yet another nod this year for his “Carnival” collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign.
286657220,Washington — President Trump announced he is pausing U.S. tariffs targeting imports from Mexico for a month after the country's president agreed to send 10_000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl.Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday that he and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum "agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period." The pause_ he said_ will allow "negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio_ Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent_ and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick_ and high-level Representatives of Mexico."The president wrote that he had a "very friendly conversation" with Sheinbaum in which she "agreed to immediately supply 10_000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States.""These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl_ and illegal migrants into our Country_" Mr. Trump wrote.Sheinbaum unveiled the details of the deal in an earlier post on X_ saying that the U.S. is "committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico" and that "our teams will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade." She wrote in Spanish that Mexico "will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10_000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States_ particularly fentanyl."Mr. Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada on Saturday_ in conjunction with a smaller levy on goods from China. U.S. markets tumbled in early trading Monday morning amid fears that the tariffs could drive up prices for consumer goods and stifle trade between the U.S. and its neighbors.
286621344,The release date of Civilization 7 draws near and will see the game launch on PC_ PS4_ PS5_ Xbox One_ Xbox Series X|S_ and Nintendo Switch at the same time — a first in series history. That's generally a good descriptor for the upcoming turn-based strategy game from Firaxis. It breaks franchise conventions with more than its launch platforms_ and this has caused some worries among fans. Will it still feel like Civilization?I have been given the opportunity to speak with lead designer Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk about these concerns_ the mechanical changes causing them_ and so much more in the run-up to Civilization 7's launch.Both Firaxis members are veterans of the series_ this being far from their first rodeo_ but I still want to know if such an important release is making them a little nervous. "It always is at this point of the game. You're a little anxious_" Shirk says. "This was a bigger jump than we typically do for a Civ release. There's a lot of holding of breath while we're waiting for the stuff to start flowing out and seeing what the fan reactions are. It's exciting_ but it's also nerve-wracking.""Dennis is right that this is probably one of the biggest changes this series has ever had_" Ed Beach adds. "We knew it was a big enough change that it was going to break some people out of their comfort zone. There are going to be some traditional players_ who don't want to have to choose a pathway through history for their leader in Civilization. We knew it wasn't going to be unanimous acceptance_ but what we're really seeing is that there's a lot of people embracing the new system. The previews seem very engaged with it and we're seeing our community come up with all sorts of theorycrafting."It seems like the lead designer is spending a good deal of time in online forums_ taking in what people have to say. "I have looked at the threads where they've been discussing these things and everyone is proposing something different than everyone else_" he continues. "That just shows how many different combinations there are and how many different ways people are going to be looking at that."The first topic I want to dive into more deeply are Age Transitions_ because they've become the mechanic creating the most friction in online discussions so far. In case you're out of the loop_ Civilization 7 makes you switch cultures two times per game: Once when you go from Antiquity into the Exploration Age and a second time when you advance from Exploration into the Modern Age. These Age Transitions are something of a soft reset and that's something not everyone is liking."We had a design pillar that was one of our key guideposts to make sure that we were following the whole time through the project_ which was that history comes in layers_" Beach explains. In following this design pillar_ the team wanted to make sure that things that remind players of their choices during the ongoing game are transferred to the next Age."Unique Traditions carry forward because of that_ as well as unique improvements like Terrace Farms or unique Quarters_" Beach says. Commanders stick around between Ages as well_ since players spend a lot of time and energy leveling them up_ while Attribute Points for leaders are permanent throughout a playthrough_ too."Then there are some things that carry forward just because of how important or how iconic they are for the Civilization franchise_" Beach continues. "The World Wonders_ we decided_ were worth carrying over. We had some debate on that one. Historically_ many of the wonders of the world are no longer there. They've fallen apart. No one even knows where the Hanging Gardens of Babylon are."Before your internal monologue goes 'Probably in Babylon_ duh_' I'd like to back Beach up saying that there's been no archaeological evidence for them so far at this most ancient city — some scholars have even suggested that the Hanging Gardens may have been a poetic creation and not an actual place.Back to the lead designer_ who explains: "So there was some historical precedent for them maybe not sticking around_ but we decided they were too important to the franchise and especially now with the way Wonders give adjacency bonuses to any buildings that you put next to them. They really become part of how you lay out your Cities_ so we felt like those had to stay."Beach and the team are very aware of the fact that the Age Transitions are divisive — it took a lot of effort to get them right_ he says: "You are absolutely right that this is the biggest friction point_ just because it was the thing that we had to iterate on the most to get Civ 7 together. We had Age Transitions in some of our very first builds of the game and we focus-tested this game more than we ever had to focus-test any previous game. We had over ten test rounds and every time we'd be adjusting Age Transitions a little bit more. That's how we finally got it to where it is."For those who think that the current iteration is already too radical_ the earlier implementation that Beach tells me about would probably have caused a storm of outrage. "There were some very punishing versions of Age Transitions_" he says. "Right now_ all of your Cities become Towns_ but we had versions where you could only keep like five settlements and things like that. We experimented with it a lot_ which I think gave us comfort that we could find the sweet spot in the middle. We're happy with the way it came out for sure."Another area in the spotlight has been the perception that the player is railroaded into playing a certain way_ especially during the Exploration Age. This is something that can't be waved away_ because the game is heavily steering you into engaging with the Distant Lands. I ask if the devs are concerned about this and if they have any plans to address this criticism_ for example_ via specific civilization mechanics like Mongolia has in the base game (they have a bit more flexibility for earning Military Legacy Points in the Exploration Age)."Absolutely_" Beach responds. "We've gotten that feedback in some of these focus-tests_ even before the community was aware of what's going on. We have plenty of plans to address that."Firaxis sees the crises that appear towards the end of each Age as one way to provide variety_ as the players never know which one might show up. "Another idea is exactly like you said with the Mongols_ to have a different way of approaching the victory conditions_" Beach says. "I think playing with the victory conditions and allowing some flexibility there is going to open things up wide. Nothing to announce there for right now_ but that's certainly what we're looking at."I bring up some of my concern about the AI as well_ as I'd seen some funny behavior during my time playing the game. In the Modern Age_ the AI produced a ridiculous amount of Explorers_ for example_ clearly overfocusing on the Culture Victory.Beach tells me that Firaxis has "several different strike teams within our design group."One of them is looking at pacing and progression through the Ages and it's been looking heavily at Age Transitions. Another one is specifically looking at AI behaviors. Overaggressiveness of the AI on the Explorer game was identified pretty quickly as a problem in the preview build. We've already made some adjustments. I can't remember exactly what the timetable is as to whether those are gonna be ready for when the game launches_ but they're already well into testing for sure."This should be quite reassuring for players: Even if there are issues with the AI or other aspects_ Firaxis seems to be well prepared to react quickly and efficiently to fix them.Some areas of Civilization 7 seem a little devoid of detail when compared to its predecessors. For example_ Great Works are no longer based on real historical objects. Even Artifacts_ a key piece of winning a Culture Victory_ no longer come with the same details as in Civilization 6. I bring this up_ because to me digging up an Artifact that tells me from which culture and era it stems from would be a very literal and engaging manifestation of the 'history comes in layers' design pillar. I ask if that's an area in which we can expect a bit more depth in the future."That's certainly possible_" Beach answers. "All that information is stored in the game and there are a lot of places where we're storing information so that we can build on it later and do something more interesting or more involved with it. I don't know exactly what our plans entail with that_ but we've made sure that all that information is stored away_ so that if we wanted to go back to things like theming Museums [like in Civilization 6]_ it wouldn't be a huge change to do it."Beach explains that "we're already throwing a lot at players for the very basic version of Civ 7. We've got twelve different Legacy Paths that they have to learn_ so we want to keep them not too complicated. We have three different types of Great Works — the Codices_ the Relics_ and the Artifacts — and right now they're all pretty simple_ but I would absolutely look for us to be doing a lot more with those down the road_ yeah."I'm much more happy with how Great People have been implemented in Civilization 7_ so I ask the lead designer about the story behind the changes. Turns out_ everyone who helped to make Gran Colombia such a popular DLC civilization in the previous game contributed to its use as a blueprint for how Great People would work in Civ 7."That was the first one that had a unique historically crafted set of Great People and they were a very popular civ_" Beach explains. "Simón Bolívar had so many different generals that worked with him and helped him_ it was the perfect collection of people that you could get a set of eight to ten Great People out of. So we looked for similar sets of people that would make sense."Groups like Greek philosophers and Spanish conquistadors were easy pickings for this_ but a couple of trickier examples do exist. "I think probably the most creative one that we came up with was for the French_ because we have the Jacobins and they are_ you know_ not necessarily all shining lights and beacons or niceness_ so I think that one's very interesting_" Beach says.Naturally_ the team couldn't find enough source material to form similar sets for all civilizations. Beach brings up the Mississippian culture as an example_ which makes its debut in Civ 7."There's not much in terms of a written record that has been left by them_" he explains. "We were never able to put them in Civilization before_ because the requirement was always that every culture had to have a prominent leader that we had enough information about_ even if it was mostly mythical information like for Gilgamesh_ so that we could portray them. So we discarded the Mississippians for Civ 5 and Civ 6_ as they didn't have a suitable candidate for a leader. It's great to be able to bring them into Civ 7_ because they can be paired with other leaders. But to come up with a list of Great People for them_ that just wouldn't have been possible."Another one of my personal highlights is how the conditional civilization unlocks available during a playthrough can come together to create these narratives for your run_ so I wanted to learn the origin of this mechanic as well. For those who don't know what I'm talking about_ here's an example: Say you start out as Rome with Augustus as your leader_ but you really want to play as the Ming in the following Age. Well_ there is a way to do that — you can find three Jade resources on the map and exploit them. Likewise_ unlocking Mongolia would happen by gathering three Horse resources."We started our game without those and there's a really interesting story about how the thought process between our game and some of our competitors interwove_" Beach begins. "We didn't have those and it didn't feel quite right to us_ so we started looking for solutions. Humankind came out with basically the same idea that you might want to switch civilizations in the middle of your game. They had a very freeform system where you switch five times during the game and there's no real narrative explanation for it."Beach brings in an example_ saying how someone spending time in France would easily notice all the history there: Roman aqueducts_ French castles_ Norman Bayeux Tapestry_ and so on. "You feel the layers of history around you and that idea that you could have a progression where all three of those heritages are representing your game was very powerful to us_" he says. "So we started locking in on these historical pathways as a foundational element for the game."We started realizing the richness of these historical pathways and that's why we started adding narrative elements to it_" he continues. "We actually have gone through a couple of iterations on what the unlocked conditions should be. Some of the simplest ones are the ones where you just collect a certain number of resources_ but we feel like the more interesting ones are the ones where it's sort of a gameplay choice you make. You settle on islands and then you unlock Hawai'i_ so then that feels even more rewarding. They became a really important part of the Civ 7 story and the Civ 7 design."With the finish line for our time drawing near_ I ask the duo what they would like players to think after their first game of Civilization 7."I want them to feel like they just didn't play another game of Civilization 6_" Shirk says. "I don't want to say that I hope it ended in failure_ but that they had to pull something new out of their own toolbox to really engage with the game_ because their old strategies didn't work. And when we're talking about data on the back end_ we want to see people finishing games_ just going straight through and really just reinforcing that engagement_ especially in the Modern Age."A big weak spot for the games before was that the Modern Age was a bit of a click fest_" he elaborates. "Not everybody finished games. They especially didn't like the latter part of the game because there's just a lot of mundane decisions. We do want to see people approaching it with new eyes and we've been really loving what people put together in the later ages.""What I would love to see people get out of their first game is an appreciation of the kind of storytelling that's possible in Civilization 7_" Beach answers. "We talked about these historical pathways through the game. Part of that is the story that the player is building_ but we also have a new narrative system that is sitting there_ listening to what's going on in the game.""We have 1_500 or more narrative events that can pop up_ but they're all contextual. When your river has flooded and the same City has been hit twice by a flood within a certain number of turns_ that triggers a specific story_" he explains. "Some of these stories have multiple dependencies_ so there's like a chain reaction that has to occur for you to get very deep into the story. This is going to be a really potent thing for us and for modders to add additional content on. We've gone through a lot of work to set this up_ so this game will have maybe the most immersive_ richest stories you have ever seen from a Civilization world. So I'm hoping that players see that as they play through."Civilization 7 is clearly not going to be able to please everyone. It is a bold venture_ but one with a very firm vision behind it — and the developers seem well prepared to adapt and adjust things as feedback comes in_ having their fingers at the pulse of the community.Civilization 7 is coming to PC_ PS4_ PS5_ Xbox One_ Xbox Series X|S_ and Nintendo Switch on February 11_ 2025_ though players with an edition featuring advanced access can start playing on February 6_ 2025.
286503270,Beyoncé continues her reign as the undisputed queen of the music world_ announcing her highly anticipated Cowboy Carter Tour just hours after making history at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.    Beyoncé has revealed the first nine cities for her much-anticipated Cowboy Carter & The Rodeo Chitlin’ Circuit Tour.   The cities announced include Los Angeles_ Chicago_ New York_ London_ Paris_ Houston_ Atlanta_ Washington_ D.C._ and Las Vegas. Beyoncé shared the news on Instagram_ captioning a tour poster with the words: “SHE COMING.”   The announcement comes hot on the heels of a monumental moment in Beyoncé’s career—her first-ever win for Album of the Year at the Grammys for Cowboy Carter.    The accolade marks a long-overdue recognition for the superstar and makes her the first Black woman in over two decades to take home this prestigious award_ and the fourth Black woman to ever win the accolade following Lauryn Hill in 1999_ Whitney Houston (1994) and Natalie Cole (1992).   The achievement also cements Beyoncé’s status as the most-awarded artist in Grammy history_ with an astonishing 32 wins.   “I’d like to thank and acknowledge and praise all of the firefighters for keeping us safe_” she began her heartfelt speech at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena. “I just feel very full and very honored. It’s been many_ many years.”   Bey continued: “I just want to thank the Grammys_ every songwriter_ every collaborator_ every producer for all of the hard work. I want to dedicate this to Ms. [Linda] Martell. I hope we keep pushing forward opening doors.”   It was already a decorated night for Bey as Cowboy Carter won best country album earlier in Sunday’s (Feb. 2) ceremony. She’s the first Black woman to win that award. Additionally_ she was victorious in the best country duo/group performance for “II Most Wanted_” which featured Miley Cyrus.   Following its arrival in April_ Cowboy Carter spent two weeks atop the Billboard 200. It’s her eighth album to reach the chart’s summit. Just prior to the Grammys ceremony_ Bey teased the Cowboy Carter Tour_ posting a short video on Instagram showcasing a large hanging neon sign that read “Cowboy Carter Tour_” accompanied by the sound of wind in the background.   In a follow-up post_ she shared a promotional image of herself sporting blonde braids with the caption “Cowboy Carter Tour 2025.”
286672152,Imagine The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim if all the magic and flying dragons were taken out. It would lose its fantasy flair and the player would just be a person walking around in an European-influenced setting. With no dragons around_ the land is suddenly more peaceful without the fear of fire-breathing creatures coming out of nowhere to kill you.    That sounds boring on paper_ but 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance managed to be gripping with its memorable story and side quests. They turned what was otherwise a realistic medieval simulator in a plain setting into a land filled to the brim with lore. With Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ developer Warhorse Studios doubled down on what made the first game so beloved_ while also doubling its scale and tackling some quality-of-life issues.   Generally_ its mechanics and commitment to said realism often clashed with the enjoyment of the game_ as players needed to micromanage hunger and sleep meters_ often disrupting the flow of the game_ but it offered an otherwise engaging and unique medieval experience that players couldn’t find anywhere else.   Despite its popularity_ the first game also stirred up some controversy due to the developer’s claims of “historical accuracy_” which in this particular context meant its medieval setting didn’t bother to include any kind of ethnic diversity — bucking a progressive trend that most other AAA studios have embraced. Within the video game industry_ there’s been reactionary movements against including minorities and marginalized groups_ and Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s lack of non-white characters caused a certain type of audience to rally around the game because its world and inhabitants are majority white.    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t really rectify those concerns. That’s not to say that these games have malicious racism — they don’t. But regardless of whatever intentions the developers had with the game’s historical context ultimately didn’t impact the game’s emotional story and elaborate gameplay mechanics.   With that in mind_ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 won’t change the minds of its predecessor’s detractors_ but it’s a much smoother experience this time around thanks to the lack of bugs and glitches that plagued the first game.   Going Medieval    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 takes place directly after the events of the first game with the return of Henry of Skalitz as its protagonist. He and his friend Hans Capon must travel across Bohemia to deliver a message to a political ally in order to avoid a war and potential power struggle on the throne. In the first game_ Henry’s personal rags to riches story felt appropriate for its more modest scope. But in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ the stakes are higher_ filled with shifting alliances and political intrigue.    It’s an engrossing story that concludes conflicts from the first game_ with Henry finally avenging his family and proving that he’s worthy of respect despite his lower-class origins. Along the way_ Henry encounters new enemies and familiar allies_ with the dynamic between Henry and Hans being fun and comedic_ a welcome change in tone to the game’s unforgiving setting. Henry’s upbringing and tribulations from the first game make him much more humble_ and conflicts with Hans’ spoiled royal childhood. Like true friends_ they bicker with each other before going their separate ways_ only to somehow meet up again when shit hits the fan and make up.   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is an absolutely massive game_ expanding beyond its predecessor with two open world regions this time. For a medieval open world_ it’s surprisingly packed with story-rich side quests. Many developers have recently scaled back their open-worlds due to the inability to fill them with meaningful content_ but there’s no shortage of that in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. One memorable quest involves Henry seeking out a missing father_ fighting off wolves_ and then painstakingly carrying the father on his shoulder while he drunkenly changes his mind about where he wants to be dropped off at.   I ran Henry in the pitch black night on an empty stomach_ which made his fist fight against the wolves exponentially harder_ but he still pulled through with a sliver of health left. Quests like these make it easy to appreciate how much effort went into building out the open-world and bringing it to life.   While the game looks fine_ the biggest improvement over the first one is the amount of polish. There weren’t any game breaking glitches that tanked the experience or blocked overall story progression.   As real as it gets    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s commitment to realism can be seen throughout its complex gameplay systems. Players have to fill his hunger and sleep meters_ which in turn can impact his combat prowess. The survival mechanics may turn players away and sometimes even stifle your current approach_ but situations like these force improvisation and is part of the fun.   In direct sequels with returning protagonists_ it’s common to see them get nerfed (meaning: reduced in ability) to a weakened state in the game’s intro. In games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ where the protagonist is at an all-powerful peak following the events of the previous story_ the narrative requires Link to lose everything (including an arm) and start back at square one.    It’s a frequently used shorthand merging both story and gameplay that gives an in-universe reason for players’ need to progress_ even when they already did so in a previous game. At the very beginning of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ Henry and Hans’ group gets ambushed and murdered while they’re both away for a swim_ forcing them to retreat in only their underpants. Now_ they basically have to start over_ with no one believing that they’re messengers sent by royalty. But it was fun building Henry up again.    At the start of his new journey_ Henry has very little money_ so players have several options to survive. For example_ Henry can trespass on private property and sneak in a nap in a stranger’s bed or eat from their pot of stew at the risk of getting caught by the homeowner and driven out of town.   Even mundane tasks have intricate steps to complete and mini-games_ such as alchemy_ blacksmithing_ and even pickpocketing that flesh out their systems. In many RPGs_ players can select an item or weapon to make_ and if they have the proper materials_ it just materializes out of thin air. Not in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. As a blacksmith himself_ Henry strenuously goes through the entire process_ including heating metal_ shaping it into form_ and then quenching it off in a barrel of cool water. Players even have to learn to hit the metal evenly_ and understand when to reheat it so that the material doesn’t break.    Henry also has a recipe book with step-by-step instructions on how to create different potions and remedies_ which involve manually grinding to collect herbs. There’s a satisfying rhythm to these tasks_ and the game makes even the most laborious chores feel worthwhile.   The pickpocketing mini-game was surprisingly the most fun. Henry has to remain undetected while rummaging through a person’s pockets before the player sees a menu detailing the items they have. The longer he remains undetected_ the more time you have in the menu to select to steal. However_ if Henry gets caught by the victim or a witness_ then the guard will come and reprimand him.   This is where Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s save system comes into play. Like many of its other mechanics_ the save system also has an emphasis on “realism_” for better or worse. In the first game_ saving one’s data could be done in only three ways: sleeping in a bed_ drinking a Savior Schnapps potion_ and triggering an autosave during pivotal points in the story or a quest. It was incredibly inconvenient not being able to save your progress at any point_ which ended up being one of_ if not the most_ frustrating part of the game.   Eventually_ a “Save and Quit” option was added as an update_ and thankfully_ this was carried over to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. This creates a single save slot that players can continually keep reloading into. Henry gets caught trying to steal? No worries_ just reload the save. Want to try and take on a bandit camp but don’t want to risk dying? Just save right in front of it. Sure_ this option disrupts the immersion and lets you “save scum” (cheat the game by quitting out of undesirable scenarios)_ but losing an hour of progress if the game crashes or something else bad happens is even worse.   Fighting with steel    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s combat system is mostly the same as the previous game’s_ which is much slower and more methodical than most action RPGs. Instead of mindlessly slashing away at sponge-like foes_ there’s a real weight to the combat. Players have to outsmart opponents with only four directional inputs and strike when they’re most vulnerable. By carefully watching which direction opponents raise their weapons or shields_ the combat almost feels like a performance. Blocking and stamina management play huge roles too_ making sure that there’s some back-and-forth tension between Henry and his opponents. With no special tricks up Henry’s sleeves_ like magic or flashy attacks_ there’s an authentic sense of depth and skill to every movement.   Skill progression is also complex but easy to understand. Henry’s stats level up by simply performing actions that correspond with them in real life. For example_ combat increases his strength and vitality by running around. There’s even a skill tree for drinking alcohol_ and one of the unlockable perks allows Henry to be 20-percent quieter when drunk. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 prides itself in realism_ but these little instances of gamification give it personality.   The equipment and inventory screens are confusing to scroll through_ though. There’s a lot that goes into armor: Henry first has to put on a mail coif before adding on any other sort of head protection_ as well as wear a pair of leggings under his leg armor. The UI is sometimes difficult to read_ especially with the font size being so small. These little details are impressive_ but the constant flipping between screens gets tiresome after a while. Being bogged down in menus means spending less time in the world itself.   Even when battles or side quests weren’t going smoothly_ nothing in the game ever felt like a waste of time. There were times where I’d trek back and forth between defeating bandits and the local tailor so I could sell the gear I looted off of them for money. While carrying all of that equipment encumbered Henry to the point where he couldn’t sprint_ he at least gained a few Vitality levels.   Nothing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 comes quickly. Even going from place to place requires time and effort. It’s reminiscent of Dragon’s Dogma 2_ where the friction between the player and the in-game systems is part of the overall experience. Whereas Capcom’s action RPG is archaically and annoyingly old school_ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 avoids similar pitfalls by including an easily accessible fast travel system. It might seem antithetical given the game’s other painstakingly realistic aspirations_ but it helps alleviate those feelings of frustration that will crop up when being forced to repeatedly hoof it across the expansive world. When using fast travel_ Henry moves around the map like a board game piece_ and can sometimes encounter emergent scenarios like a townsperson being harassed by bandits_ giving him a choice whether or not he likes to engage.   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is not an easy game by any means. Its dedication to realism will have players experience what it’s like to live in medieval times_ not the most pleasant era to be in. It’s dragged down by some cumbersome micromanagement_ as well as clunky combat and controls. But that’s part of its appeal. When progress runs smoothly_ it feels like Henry is on top of the world_ but when things go awry_ it feels like the end of it. The game is a period piece that unabashedly knows what it wants to be — basically the first game but better. Add an riveting and sentimental story on top of it_ and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is equally compelling as it is frustrating.

286698144,On Monday_ U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to establish a sovereign wealth fund.He indicated that this fund could potentially be used to purchase TikTok.More to follow.
286594534,WASHINGTON (AP) — Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed to stay out of the agency’s Washington headquarters on Monday_ according to a notice distributed to them_ after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.  USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who reported being locked out of the agency’s computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that “at the direction of Agency leadership” the headquarters building “will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday_ Feb. 3.”  The developments come after Musk_ who’s leading an extraordinary civilian review of the federal government with the Republican president’s agreement_ said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and “he agreed we should shut it down.”  “It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in_” Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. “What we have is just a ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s beyond repair.”  “We’re shutting it down_” he said.  Musk_ Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid and development agency_ which oversees humanitarian_ development and security programs in some 120 countries_ in increasingly strident terms_ accusing it of promoting liberal causes.  Over the weekend_ the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk’s government-inspection teams_ a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday.  Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency_ known as DOGE_ earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department_ gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk’s team accessing sensitive information.  Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves_ saying Trump lacks constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional approval and decrying Musk’s accessing sensitive government-held information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal government agencies and programs.  USAID_ whose website vanished Saturday without explanation_ has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs.  “It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them out_” Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.   Musk’s and Trump’s comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio out of the country_ in Central America_ on his first trip abroad in office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down USAID.  The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s aid programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency’s leadership and staff in Washington..   Peter Marocco_ a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term_ was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors’ badges asking questions of employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk’s DOGE team.  Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump was allowing Musk to access people’s personal information and shut down government funding.   “We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm_” the Massachusetts senator said_ without giving details.

287029974,In most settlements in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 you'll find people that want to play Dice. Dice is a popular game_ and a lot of players "tactically" use dice which are_ well_ perhaps not strictly legal. In KCD2 you can collect a bunch of your own loaded dice to turn the tables and win a bunch of money. Dice is also the easiest way to earn easy money in the early game.In this guide we're breaking down how to play Dice in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 so you can easily win money from peasants and have a healthy amount of money going into the early and mid-game. Read on for everything you need to know.How To Play Dice in KCD2Dice in KCD2 is a bit like Poker. You start the round by rolling six dice_ and you must make a "hand" out of the dice you have available to score points. If you cannot score from your dice_ you go Bust_ and the round goes to the next player. We'll detail a full list of possible dice combinations and scores below_ but you should know that a 1 is worth 100 points_ and a 5 is worth 50 individually_ so either of those dice individually will count as a scoring hand.If you score_ you have the choice of rolling your remaining dice again. For example_ if from your first hand you hold a 1 and continue_ you will roll the five remaining dice. If you can score with your remaining dice_ you can continue again_ but if you cannot_ you lose the score from your held 1. Once you've scored_ you have a choice of ending the round_ and only when you end a round manually do you keep your score.If you manage to score with all six of your dice without going bust_ you can roll all six again while keeping your score. It's theoretically possible to continue to roll all six dice again and again_ but statistically unlikely. This is easier to achieve by scoring with dice combinations_ instead of with individual dice.The more dice you hold_ the fewer dice you have to roll and potentially score with. We recommend you only ever roll with as few as four dice_ as rolling with three dice is very unlikely to give you a score unless you're using specific loaded dice.The amount of points you and your opponent compete for depends on how much money is at play_ but since players can potentially score multiple large hands in a row_ you should never let a point lead let you feel overconfident. Likewise_ since it is technically possible to go bust on your first roll_ you should never give up a game early_ as the dice just may roll in your favor.Badge Modifiers in KCD2You can collect a variety of badges from across the world_ and these are ranked by Tin_ Silver_ and Gold. They're quite valuable – you can sell them if you don't have a use for them – but you're better off using them in Dice games.Badges allow you to activate modifiers such as adding more points to your round score_ or transforming a dice in your current roll to a five. Like the loaded dice_ there are a bunch of different badges for you to collect and wager in Dice games.If a dice player offers a game including a badge_ then there's a high likelihood that you will be able to wager and win a badge in that game_ giving you more options in your future games. But if you prefer to play dice normally_ you can always use a badge which simply disables your opponent's badge.All Dice Hands and Combinations in KCD2These are the single dice and large combinations you should be aiming for. 1 = 100 points 5 = 50 points 1+2+3+4+5 = 500 points 2+3+4+5+6 = 750 points 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 1500 points Since you can use multiple combinations in a single hand_ you can combine some of these hands to use up all six dice. If you manage to get 1+2+3+4+5_ for example_ and also have an additional 1_ you can use all dice for the 100 point and 500 point combinations. This allows you to roll all six dice again.In addition to the above combinations_ you can also combine three or more of the same number dice for large scores. Three 2s give you 200 points_ three 3s give you 300 points_ and so on. Each additional dice added to the combination doubles the previous score_ so four 2s give you 400 points_ four 3s give you 600_ and so on. 1X3 = 1000 points 1X4 = 2000 points 1X5 = 4000 points 1X6 = 8000 points 2X3 = 200 points 2X4 = 400 points 2X5 = 800 points 2X6 = 1600 points 3X3 = 300 points 3X4 = 600 points 3X5 = 1200 points 3X6 = 2400 points 4X3 = 400 points 4X4 = 800 points 4X5 = 1600 points 4X6 = 3200 points 5X3 = 500 points 5X4 = 1000 points 5X5 = 2000 points 5X6 = 4000 points 6X3 = 600 points 6X4 = 1200 points 6X5 = 2400 points 6X6 = 4800 points The Devil's Head Joker Dice in KCD2Some special dice include The Devil's Head on some of their faces. The Devil's Head can act as any other dice in a combination. So_ if you need an extra 6 for a triple 6 hand_ then the Devil's Head can act as that extra 6. One of the rarest and most useful types of dice to own.
286811138,U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says El Salvador's president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality as well as violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States.President Nayib Bukele “has agreed to the most unprecedented_ extraordinary_ extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world_” Rubio said."He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentence in the United States even though they’re U.S. citizens or legal residents.”Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to reduce or eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal_ the U.S. would act to do so.Migration_ though_ was the main issue of the day as it will be for the next stops on his five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica_ Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador.President Donald Trump’s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.RELATED STORY | Rubio echoes Trump's warning over China's influence on Panama CanalSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele said the arrangement with the U.S. was a broad agreement "that does not have precedent in the history of the relationship_ not just of the United States with El Salvador but rather I think in Latin America.”Human rights activists have warned_ however_ that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.Manuel Flores_ the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front_ criticized any such plan_ saying it would signal that the region is Washington’s “backyard to dump the garbage.”The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight_ which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It’s unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation_ especially in front of cameras.“Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era_” Rubio said_ speaking afterward in a nearby building. “It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way_ and it’s not good for anyone.”Monday’s deportation flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States_ and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.“This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration_ of mass migration_ which is destructive and destabilizing_” Rubio said. “And it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we’re going to continue to do it.”His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting_ but details of those were not immediately available.While Rubio was out of the country_ staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed on Monday to stay out of the agency’s Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades — although its new status will likely be challenged in court — and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.In his remarks_ Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal_ Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal_ which the U.S. turned over in 1999_ although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.“I understand that it’s a delicate issue in Panama_” Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. “We don’t want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama_” he said. “I don’t believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation_ and I hope it’ll yield fruits and result in the days to come.”But back in Washington_ Trump was less diplomatic_ saying "China’s involved with the Panama Canal. They won’t be for long and that’s the way it has to be.”“We either want it back_ or we’re going to get something very strong_ or we’re going to take it back_” Trump told reporters at the White House. “And China will be dealt with.”As he has in the past_ Trump again criticized the Carter administration for having signed a 1970s treaty to cede control of the canal to Panama and said it was a pact that Panama has since “totally violated.”“They’ve agreed to certain things_ but I’m not happy with it_” Trump said.
286931774,President Trump’s choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be the nation’s next health secretary will face a critical test in the Senate on Tuesday_ when members of the Finance Committee — including a Republican doctor uneasy about Mr. Kennedy’s views on vaccines — will vote on whether to reject the nomination or forward it to the Senate floor.  Mr. Kennedy’s fate may hinge on that doctor_ Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. He has said publicly that he is wrestling with how to vote_ and on Monday he posted on social media what many took as a hint: a quote from the Bible on the topic of courage.  “Joshua said to them: ‘Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight_’” Mr. Cassidy_ who is also the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health_ Education_ Labor and Pensions_ wrote on X.  The Finance Committee has 14 Republicans and 13 Democrats. If every Democrat votes against Mr. Kennedy_ a no vote by Mr. Cassidy would deprive Mr. Kennedy of a favorable recommendation to the full Senate. But it would not necessarily doom his nomination; it is possible that Republicans could use procedural tactics to force the full Senate to vote. It is also possible that Mr. Cassidy votes to move the nomination forward on the grounds that the full Senate should consider it_ while reserving the right to vote against Mr. Kennedy on the floor.

287040964,No one wants to be a filthy peasant. Certainly not in the harsh_ cruel world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ where people will shun you just for being a little bit stinky. To help you avoid that_ here are a few beginner tips to help give you a smoother start in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.  Your Clothes Are in Your Inventory  Once you’ve completed the tutorial segment in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ you’ll be released into the open-world almost completely naked. Henry will remark that he needs some clothes_ but how on earth are you supposed to get clothes if you have no Groschen?  The good news is that even though you got arrested and detained in your underwear for the night_ your clothes are actually still in your inventory. Press up on the d-pad and navigate over to your inventory_ then click on all of your clothing options to equip them.  Your starting clothes aren’t great_ but they will at least make Henry look a bit more presentable_ and also make it easier for you to navigate the harsh world and talk to people.  Follow the Main Story Path First  It might be tempting to just venture out into the great unknown and try to tackle every single side quest you come across_ but I don’t recommend doing that. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 isn’t exactly your typical open-world RPG after all. You need Groschen_ you need a place to sleep_ you need some semblance of stability in your life!  To that end_ I recommend following the main story path first. You’ll need to get to the wedding and you have two ways of doing so: by seeking help from the blacksmith or the miller. Both NPCs are located in different towns_ so just pick one and go talk to them.  In my playthrough_ I went with Radzig the blacksmith and got a job smithing. This allowed to me craft a basic sword and axe_ while also leveling up my smithing skills. More importantly_ though_ getting a job with either the blacksmith or miller also gives you access to a room and bed you can call your own. I can’t overstate just how important it is to have a place to rest. Sleeping will allow Henry to recover all his HP_ and also ensure that you’re well-rested for the next day.  The room you get also gives you access to a storage chest_ which should help with any encumbrance issues. If you happened to pre-order the deluxe edition of the game_ the storage chest will contain all of the goodies that come with it.  Chest Inventories are Shared  Speaking of chests_ it’s worth noting that chest inventories are shared in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. For instance_ if you stored something in your personal chest at the blacksmith’s place_ you’ll be able to access all of those items if you get another personal chest elsewhere.  This makes it easier for you to organize your items_ and you won’t have to travel between locations to sort things out.  Spend Your Perk Points  This one’s easy to forget as the game doesn’t remind you about it regularly_ but as you level up in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2_ make sure to spend your perk points.  There are a whole ton of skill categories to explore in the game_ and unlocking these perks will make your time in the game much easier. For instance_ there are perks that help reduce wear and tear on your armor_ and perks that make it easier for you to haggle with NPCs.  Personally_ I loved investing as many points as I could into the Speech category. Much like its predecessor_ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 features a whole ton of quests that you can complete just by outwitting NPCs or persuading them to see things your way. If you’re not a huge fan of the combat (which has seen some improvements_ by the way)_ then Speech is definitely the way to go.  Discover as Many Locations as Possible  Finally_ even during the early hours of the game_ try to uncover as much of the world map as you can. By discovering new towns and points of interest_ you can unlock them as fast travel points so you don’t have to manually hoof it every time you want to go somewhere else. This can be very helpful early on_ before you get your horse back.  Speaking of horses_ it is possible to get Pebbles back by following the main path. Once you reach Semine_ speak with the horse trader about getting Pebbles back. You can either pay up_ or convince him to let you have Pebbles for free if your Speech is high enough.  Hopefully these tips will help you get by in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and make things a little easier.
287029972,By the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2_ you'll be flexing your wealth on every commoner that crosses your path. But in the early game_ 100 Groschen feels like a small fortune. It's tough to easily get more money when you don't have much to start with_ but if you're struggling to earn a few hundred Groschen_ there's a pretty good method of reliably doubling your money.In this guide_ we're breaking down an early money farm that you'll likely find very useful. If you a few hundred Groschen to buy a quest item_ upgrade your equipment_ or repair the gear you've found_ then simply follow this money farming method and you'll get what you need quickly and easily in KCD2.How To Farm Money in Tachov – KCD2Tachov is an early town in KCD2_ just to the North of Troskowitz. This is where the Blacksmith resides_ who can give you work and help you infiltrate the wedding at Semine. Once the Blacksmith accepts you as an apprentice_ he will allow you to sleep in the spare room. This is an owned bed_ which saves the game each time you sleep.Sleep_ and during the day_ head to the Tavern just North of the Blacksmith's house. Dice players gather outside the front of the Tavern_ and one of those players will play you for 130 Groschen per game.You need 130 Groschen to earn that much_ of course_ but you can play lower rank games to earn money first. If you lose_ simply reload the save you made while sleeping in your bed_ and replay the Dice game until you win. Once you win_ sleep for an hour to save the game_ and continue playing Dice.The higher level Dice games in Tachov are only available during the day_ while a lower-rank player appears at night. In the early game being able to generate 130 Groschen per attempt is incredibly profitable_ and playing Dice is pretty fun_ too.Make sure to read through our full explanation on how to play Dice in KCD2.
287049152,Tiger Woods announced that his mother_ Kultida_ died Tuesday morning.  “It is with heartfelt sadness that I want to share that my dear mother_ Kultida Woods_ passed away early this morning_” Woods wrote in a post on X. “My Mom was a force of nature all her own_ her spirit was simply undeniable. She was quick with the needle and a laugh. She was my biggest fan_ greatest supporter_ without her none of my personal achievements would have been possible.   “She was loved by so many_ but especially by her two grandchildren_ Sam and Charlie. Thank you all for your support_ prayers and privacy at this difficult time for me and my family. Love you Mom.”  Kultida and Tiger’s dad_ Earl_ got married in Brooklyn in 1969 after meeting in Thailand three years earlier as Earl served during the Vietnam War.  Woods_ 49_ once described his mother as an “enforcer” during a 2017 interview with USA Today.  “My dad was always the person who would plant seeds and give me encouragement but also would say things that would fester inside me that wouldn’t come to fruition for a while_” Woods said. “He was very worldly and deep in his thinking. My mom was the enforcer. My dad may have been in the Special Forces_ but I was never afraid of him. My mom’s still here and I’m still deathly afraid of her. She’s a very tough_ tough old lady_ very demanding. She was the hand_ she was the one_ I love her so much_ but she was tough.  “There was zero negotiation.”  Woods’ dad died from a heart attack in 2006.
286819282,Trump announced he’s planning to appoint Michael Ellis and the deputy director of the CIA. Ellis is a close Trump ally and worked in the president’s previous administration and helped fight allegations of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election.  The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five US universities including Columbia and the University of California_ Berkeley_ the Education Department announced Monday.  The US Senate on Monday confirmed Chris Wright_ a fracking executive_ to be Donald Trump’s energy secretary. The vote was 59-38. Wright_ 60_ the CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 has said he will step down from the company once confirmed. He wrote in a Liberty report last year that he believes human-caused climate change is real_ but that its hazards are “distant and uncertain”. He has also said that top-down governmental policies to curb it are destined to fail.  The US interior department has unveiled a suite of orders aimed at carrying out Donald Trump’s agenda to maximise domestic energy and minerals production and slash red tape_ Reuters reports. In a statement_ the agency said interior secretary Doug Burgum_ the former governor of North Dakota_ signed six orders on his first day in office.  US President Donald Trump has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to visit the White House next week_ a White House official said_ hours after a US military plane departed to return deported migrants to the country.  Senator Susan Collins_ a republican from Maine_ said she’ll vote to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. Collins is a key swing vote and her support brings Gabbard’s nomination close to being sealed.  Trump is reportedly mulling an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education_ in alignment with mandates from Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” to slash federal agencies.  Musk’s Doge reportedly accessed administration systems for the federal Small Business Administration. It has also reportedly accessed secure information at USAid and the Treasury department. According to Wired_ Musk has reportedly deployed six young men to lead Doge’s efforts to access federal government data.  The Trump administration made plain its intent to merge USAid with the state department under Musk’s supervision. Employees were barred from the agency headquarters today_ after the website was shuttered over the weekend. Several democrats cried foul_ calling the act illegal and denouncing Musk.  The Trump administration may today begin using an obscure 18th-century law to deport undocumented migrants without first going through the courts.  Darren Beattie_ a former White House official who wrote_ “Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work_” is reportedly set for a top role at the state department.

286977780,We've finally got a proper glimpse of Marvel's first family in the trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Posted on Marvel's official YouTube channel_ which you can see below_ it's our longest look yet at the film. It features The Thing cooking in the kitchen_ the Human Torch taking flight_ and Sue Storm turning invisible.As well as that_ there's a foreboding shot of Galactus casting his considerable shadow over New York City. He's smaller than his usual planet-sized self_ but then again_ he can change size at will.Marvel teased the trailer yesterday in 20 seconds of footage showing a crowd of eager children watching a space launch from a TV shop window. Space exploration plays a big role in The Fantastic Four: First Steps_ it being a basis for how the superhero team got their powers. Notably_ the trailer establishes our heroes already have their powers_ meaning this won't be a long-drawn-out origin story.According to their start in the comics_ an experimental space flight exposes them to cosmic rays_ giving each of the four members incredible abilities. The Thing acquires rock-hard skin and super strength_ Human Torch gets fire manipulation and flight_ Mister Fantastic gains stretchy limbs_ and Sue Storm starts turning invisible.As seen in the trailer_ The Fantastic Four: First Steps has a uniquely retro aesthetic. Set to a vibrant 1960s backdrop_ it's a time period full of chunky televisions and knitted costumes_ a far cry from Captain America: Brave New World and Sam Wilson's technologically advanced kit (that launches 14 February 2025).Is Captain America in The Fantastic Four?Speaking of Captain America_ there are those that think we'll see a cameo from the previous Captain America_ Steve Rogers. That's because at the end of Avengers: Endgame_ he goes back to the past_ just after the end of WW2_ to be with his love Peggy Carter. If so_ we'll see a Rogers who's roughly 15 years older than he was at the end of Endgame.However_ The Fantastic Four: First Steps might not be set in our reality at all. Instead_ it could take place in an alternate version of the 1960s. That explains why there are some pieces of technology not present in the actual 1960s_ such as the Fantastic Four's robot pal_ H.E.R.B.I.E.Also_ the 'alternate timeline' theory explains why The Fantastic Four weren't available to help out when Loki invaded Earth in 2012's Avengers Assemble_ nor on the other numerous invasions that happened since. That's why the most popular theory is they'll get warped into the MCU proper (or 'The Sacred Timeline' of Earth-616) at the end of the movie.They'll have Galactus to deal with before then_ though. Maybe he'll wipe out Earth in the film_ forcing the Fantastic Four to hop into a different universe. One of the biggest villains in Marvel history_ Galactus is played by Ralph Ineson_ and he has the power to eat entire planets.

287153180,The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm Pam Bondi as U.S. Attorney General in President Donald Trump's administration.   Republicans were able to overcome the dissenting votes from Democrats to confirm Bondi 54 to 46.   'Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime_ and Making America Safe Again.'   Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois continued to oppose Bondi and Trump's pick for FBI director_ Kash Patel.   "I urge my colleagues to think twice about Pam Bondi and Kash Patel_" said Durbin. "This is not what we should expect or want from the FBI and the Department of Justice."  Bondi had been berated by Democratic senators who asked if she would support a blanket pardon of those arrested over the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.   "As I said_ the pardons are at the direction of the president_" Bondi said at the time. "We will look_ and we will advise. I will look at every case on a case-by-case basis_ and I abhor violence to police officers."  Bondi served as the first female attorney general for Florida and was well-known to Trump before his second term.   "For too long_ the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans — Not anymore_" he said in November when announcing her nomination. "Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime_ and Making America Safe Again."   Like Blaze News?

287192740,President Donald Trump is reportedly set to sign an executive order Wednesday that would ban transgender athletes from playing in girl’s and women’s sports in schools that accept federal funding.  The president is expected to sign the order on Wednesday to coincide with National Girls and Women in Sports Day_ according to The Hill.  While the order’s text has not been pre-released_ a president does not have the authority to place an outright_ nationwide ban on transgender athletes playing as females. However_ the executive does control federal funding as it pertains to Title IX rules. So_ it is likely the order will direct that Title IX rules be re-written to exclude trans athletes from playing as females or risk a cutoff of federal funds.  NCAA President Charlie Baker already signaled that if Title IX rules are changed_ his college sports organization would quickly move to adhere to the letter of such changes.  “We’re a national governing body_ and we follow federal law_” Baker said before Congress in December. However_ he also urged lawmakers to provide “clarity” on the issue.  The move to alter Title IX rules is likely to spur lawsuits by extreme transgender rights organizations eager to force all schools to allow transgender athletes to choose whatever team and bathroom or changing facility they wish to use at any given time.  On the hustings during the 2024 campaign for president_ Trump promised to address the issue of transgender athletes if he were to win the White House and_ at one point_ said that the president could “ban it_” adding_ “You just don’t let it happen. Not a big deal.”  Polls show that Trump has strong support among voters. Recently_ a poll found that 60 percent oppose the extreme_ left-wing Democrat transgender agenda. Another found that 75 percent of parents oppose the “harmful” trans agenda in schools. Another discovered that a majority of 51 percent oppose medical procedures that result in the transgendering of children.  Already_ 27 states have moved to ban transgender athletes from playing as females in state-supported schools and sports leagues. Many are mired in court cases as radical transgender activists seek to stop the laws from going into effect.  The struggle between supporters of transgenderism and those who want to protect women’s spaces seems destined to end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

287276282,The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that nearly all U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) workers will be withdrawn from the field_ effectively ending a six-decade mission that has funded education_ tackled epidemics and fought global starvation.A notice posted online detailed the decision_ which is the latest in a series of actions that have drastically reduced the agency's operations. The Associated Press reported that emails were also sent to USAID employees.Why It MattersUSAID_ an independent agency established in 1961_ has played a central role in U.S. foreign policy_ providing humanitarian assistance in over 120 countries. The withdrawal will impact billions of dollars in aid projects_ including security assistance for Ukraine and educational programs for Afghan girls under Taliban rule.The move follows an earlier freeze on foreign aid. Political appointees from Trump's first term and billionaire Elon Musk's efficiency teams have labeled many USAID programs as wasteful_ leading to widespread layoffs and funding cuts.Critics argue that the dismantling of USAID could weaken U.S. influence abroad_ ceding ground to geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia.What to KnowThe directive takes effect at midnight on Friday_ giving direct hires working overseas 30 days to return home unless deemed essential. Contractors not classified as essential will also be terminated_ according to the notice.The decision to pull back USAID workers was one of several proposals considered to consolidate the agency into the State Department. Other options included shutting down smaller missions and reducing operations at larger ones.Health initiatives_ including those credited with ending polio and smallpox and an HIV/AIDS program that has saved over 20 million lives in Africa_ have already been halted. Additionally_ U.S.-funded teams that respond to global disease outbreaks_ such as an Ebola outbreak in Uganda_ have been dismantled.The administration's sudden freeze has also left hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of food and medical supplies sitting in ports waiting to be distributed.Locally employed USAID staff_ who are excluded from federal employee protections_ will not be offered buyouts_ making their futures uncertain. Meanwhile_ foreign and civil service officers_ who have legal protection from arbitrary dismissal_ are being placed on leave.The American Foreign Service Association_ which represents U.S. diplomats_ strongly opposed the move_ saying it is preparing legal action to counter or halt it.What People Are SayingMusk posted to X on Monday: "We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper."Republican Senator John Kennedy said on Tuesday before the notice was released: "To my friends who are upset_ I would say - with respect - you know_ call somebody who cares. They better get used to this."Philip Brenner_ Emeritus Professor of International Relations and History at American University in Washington_ D.C._ previously told Newsweek: "The Trump administration's attempt to shut down USAID is both illegal and unwise."What Happens NextThe administration's decision is expected to face legal challenges_ as USAID's status as an independent agency is protected by congressional legislation. Lawmakers from both parties have argued that dismantling the agency without congressional approval may be unlawful.While exceptions may be granted for certain staffers requiring more time to relocate_ uncertainty remains as the agency's personnel and leadership are being removed en masse. USAID's website_ which went offline over the weekend_ returned on Tuesday night with only the recall notice posted.The decision also raises logistical concerns_ as staffers have been left scrambling to finalize paperwork_ move households_ and_ in some cases_ find ways to bring pets home amid the chaotic withdrawal process.With the future of U.S. foreign aid in question_ the long-term consequences of the agency's dismantling remain unclear.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
287158690,President Donald Trump's suggestion that the U.S. should "take over the Gaza Strip" and develop the disputed territory into "the Riviera of the Middle East" drew sharp actions across the globe and political spectrum on Tuesday.In a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu_ Trump made a bold assertion that the estimated 1.6 million refugees should "clear out" of Gaza while the U.S. takes on the roll of developing the disputed territory."I don't think people should be going back_" said Trump_ saying Egypt_ Jordan and other Arab nations should take in the displaced Palestinians. "You can't live in Gaza right now. I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that's going to make people happy."Domestically_ Trump drew criticism from both sides of the aisle. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) took Trump to task over the comments that appeared to catch even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu off guard."He's totally lost it_" Murphy posted on X. "A U.S. invasion of Gaza would lead to the slaughter of thousands of U.S. troops and decades of war in the Middle East. It's like a bad_ sick joke."
287179536,President Donald Trump_ who campaigned on a promise to put America first_ just proposed the wildest and most improbable intervention by the United States in overseas affairs since the invasion and occupation of Iraq_ more than 20 years ago.  At a joint press conference with the Israeli prime minister_ Benjamin Netanyahu_ Trump promised that the U.S. would become the occupier of Gaza.  “The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we’ll do a job with it_ too. We’ll own it_” Trump said. “I do see a long-term ownership position_ and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East_ and maybe the entire Middle East.” Trump suggested that U.S. troops would be used_ if needed_ to implement his vision for Gaza.  He presented this idea_ one never before suggested by a U.S. president or Middle East peace negotiator_ as a way to end generations of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and_ also_ as a bonus_ an opportunity to create sweet real-estate development opportunities. The idea was breathtaking in its audacity_ and it would be fair to say that its implementation would run into myriad obstacles at home and abroad_ except that the overwhelming likelihood is that the U.S. would never come near implementing this notion.  Trump’s proposal to displace 2.2 million Palestinian residents from their homes_ which he expanded on today_ has already angered the Arab world. A direct American intervention in Gaza would radically expand the U.S. footprint in the Middle East_ giving it possession of a territory devastated by 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces_ ignited by the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7_ 2023. And it could further destabilize a region never known for its stability.  Trump_ as is his practice_ offered few details as he outlined the expansive idea at a White House press conference_ standing next to a smiling Netanyahu.  The president—who has long been vociferously opposed to U.S. military intervention abroad—did not rule out sending the American military to secure Gaza while it was being rebuilt. Asked if U.S. troops would be deployed_ Trump said that “we’ll do what’s necessary … We’ll take it over and develop it.”  The plan would permanently remove Gaza’s residents from Palestinian territory and settle them outside of their land. Trump did not specify where homes for the new refugees might be found_ though he again repeated his desire for Egypt and Jordan to take in Gaza’s residents. Both of those nations have firmly declined_ their leaders quietly panicking_ according to regional diplomats_ at the thought of Trump forcing them to take radicalized Palestinians as refugees.  The displacement would presumably be met with outrage across the region. Palestinians_ like Israelis_ want to stay on their land. Neighboring Arab nations—even those with close U.S. ties—would not want to abet an Israeli expulsion of Palestinians from the Strip. The Saudi foreign ministry released a statement offering its “unequivocal rejection” of any attempt “to displace the Palestinian people from their land.”  A cease-fire took hold in Gaza just before Trump took office_ bringing a tentative halt to a conflict that has reportedly killed more than 20_000 Palestinian civilians and as many as 20_000 Hamas militants_ leveled much of the Strip_ and created a devastating humanitarian crisis. Trump’s plan would pull the United States even more deeply into the conflict because it would take over the territory_ which has been fought over since Egypt occupied it in 1948.  The region has already been reshaped by Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks_ which killed nearly 1_200 people and saw another 250 taken hostage. Israel has pummeled Hamas_ destroying its leadership_ and also delivered devastating blows to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Combined with the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria_ the events of the past year have left Iran more isolated than it has been in decades_ and Trump today ordered the return of the “maximum pressure” campaign to sanction Tehran.  Trump’s Gaza plan_ were it to be carried out_ would appear to be a remarkable win for the far-right members in Netanyahu’s governing coalition_ who have longed for permanent Israeli expansion into both Gaza and the West Bank. Netanyahu—a longtime Trump ally_ and the first foreign leader to visit the White House in the president’s second term—suggested that he was open to the idea_ noting that Trump “sees a different future for that piece of land.” He added: “It’s worth paying attention to this. We’re talking about it. It’s something that could change history.”  One White House official told me that Trump’s comments were not a spur-of-the-moment suggestion but reflective of a newfound_ postelection confidence that he could put together the ultimate deal and change decades of history.  “Look_ the Gaza thing has not worked. It’s never worked_” Trump told reporters. “I think they should get a good_ fresh_ beautiful piece of land_ and we get some people to put up the money to build it and make it nice and make it habitable and enjoyable.” Trump has been buoyed by two first-term Middle East initiatives that Washington experts said would have devastating consequences for U.S. national security_ but did not: the decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the capital_ Jerusalem_ and the order to assassinate the Iranian Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani.  Trump—who also has been publicly and privately musing about winning a Nobel Peace Prize—has been known to first take an outlandish position and then move to a more moderate stance. Sometimes there is a method to his madness_ and sometimes there is simply madness in his madness. World leaders_ from Denmark to Panama to the Middle East_ have spent the past two weeks trying to discern the difference.  “It occurs to me that Trump may have floated this idea to raise the stakes after Arab countries refused his request to take in Palestinians_” Mark Dubowitz_ the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies_ wrote on X. “Now_ he’s cranking up the pressure: If you won’t take them_ we’ll remove them ourselves and take control of Gaza. Classic Trump: Go to the extreme_ making what once seemed outrageous suddenly look like the reasonable middle ground.”  Whatever motivated Trump’s comments_ his proposal remains a repudiation of the principle of national self-determination_ which has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for more than a century_ albeit one that has been imperfectly honored.  Any direct U.S. intervention in Gaza would fly in the face of Trump’s long-standing desire to disengage from foreign entanglements; he began negotiations to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan_ wants to slash aid to Ukraine_ and has threatened to abandon military positions in Korea_ Europe_ and Syria. And it may face pushback at home from some usually reliable allies.  “I think that would be an interesting proposal_” Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill after Trump spoke. “We’ll see what our Arab friends say about that. I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza. It might be problematic.”  The plan also_ ultimately_ was at least a little bit about real estate. Trump remains a developer at heart_ and his son-in-law Jared Kushner said last year that Gaza’s “waterfront property could be very valuable” and that Israel should remove civilians while it “cleans up” the Strip. The president today suggested that Gaza’s beachfront property would be a draw for the Strip’s future inhabitants_ whether or not they be Palestinian_ when asked whom he imagined living in the rebuilt region.  “I envision world people living there_” Trump declared. “The Riviera of the Middle East.”
287530512,The Jimmy Butler trade saga is over. The Miami Heat are sending the disgruntled six-time All-Star to The Golden State Warriors for a package involving Andrew Wiggins_ Dennis Schröder_ Kyle Anderson and a protected first-round draft pick_ according to a report from ESPN on Wednesday. Once the trade is finalized_ Butler will sign a two-year_ $121 million contract extension with the Warriors_ according to ESPN. The Warriors were linked to several names leading up to the Feb. 6 trade deadline_ including Kevin Durant_ but after Durant made it clear he wasn't interested in returning to San Francisco_ they pivoted to Butler. Butler now joins a Warriors team headlined by two-time league MVP Stephen Curry and four-time All-Star Draymond Green. The Warriors are currently seeded No. 10 in the Western Conference with a record of 25-24. Butler's final month with the Heat had been rocky. He returned from a seven-game suspension on Jan. 17 after the small forward was disciplined by the Heat for multiple instances of conduct it deemed detrimental to the team. He was suspended again five days later_ this time for two games_ for missing a team flight. Before he was set to return on Monday_ the Heat suspended him indefinitely for walking out of practice. Prior to the first suspension_ the 2015 NBA Most Improved Player expressed that he'd lost his on-court "joy" in Miami. The team confirmed he had requested a trade shortly after. In Butler's first season with the Heat_ the team reached the NBA Finals_ and again in 2023_ for the second appearance in four years. So far this season_ Butler has played in 25 games_ posting an average of 17 points_ 5.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists. Wiggins leaves the Warriors having played a pivotal role in their 2021-122 championship run. He played six seasons in Golden State. Schröder's time in San Francisco was short-lived. The Warriors acquired the German guard in a December trade_ and traded him just two months later.
287520302,President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.  The order_ titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports_” gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view_ which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.  “With this executive order_ the war on women’s sports is over_” Trump said at a signing ceremony in the East Room that included lawmakers and female athletes who have come out in support of a ban_ including former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order “upholds the promise of Title IX” and will require “immediate action_ including enforcement actions_ against schools and athletic associations” that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.  The timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day_ and is the latest in a string of executive actions from the Republican president aimed at transgender people.  Trump found during the campaign that the topic resonated beyond the usual party lines. More than half the voters surveyed by AP VoteCast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far. He leaned into the rhetoric before the election_ pledging to get rid of “transgender insanity_” though his campaign offered little in the way of details.  The order offers some clarity. For example_ it authorizes the Education Department to penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to compete_ citing noncompliance with Title IX_ which prohibits sexual discrimination in schools. Any school found in violation could potentially be ineligible for federal funding.  Enforcing Trump’s orders will be a priority of the embattled department. In a call this week_ the acting director of the Office for Civil Rights told staff they would need to align their investigations with Trump’s priorities_ according to people who were on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to AP for fear of reprisals.  Already since Trump took office_ the department has opened an inquiry into Denver public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls’ bathroom_ while leaving another one exclusive to boys.  Trump also issued a warning to the International Olympic Committee ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president said he had empowered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make it clear to the IOC that “America categorically rejects transgender lunacy. We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.”  The IOC has essentially passed the buck on transgender participation_ deferring to the international federations for each sport.  That could change_ however_ when a new IOC president comes on to replace the retiring Thomas Bach. Former track star Sebastian Coe_ now the leader of World Athletics_ is among the candidates up for election in March. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.  Trump also said that Director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will “deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes to try and get into the Games.”  Organizers for the 2028 Olympics did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The order is the latest of a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting transgender people.  Previous ones have sought to have the federal government reject the idea that people can transition to a gender other than the one assigned at birth. That has implications for areas including passports and prisons. He’s also opened the door to barring transgender service members from the military; called to end federal health insurance and other funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19; and restrict the way lessons on gender can be taught in schools.  The latest order was condemned by trans-rights advocates_ including the National Women’s Law Center and GLAAD.  “Contrary to what the president wants you to believe_ trans students do not pose threats to sports_ schools or this country_ and they deserve the same opportunities as their peers to learn_ play and grow up in safe environments_” said Fatima Goss Graves_ president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center.  Pushback on some of the administration’s initiatives has already begun in court. Transgender people have sued over several of the policies and more are likely to come. Civil rights lawyers handling the cases have asserted that in some instances_ Trump’s orders violate laws adopted by Congress and protections in the Constitution – and that they overstep the authority of the president.  There could be similar questions for this order_ for instance: Can the president demand that the NCAA change its policies?  NCAA President Charlie Baker said its Board of Governors was reviewing the order and “will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days_ subject to further guidance from the administration.” Baker_ who said last year he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender_ noted the order at least provides a uniform policy instead of a patchwork of state laws.  The order came a day after three former teammates of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas filed a lawsuit accusing the NCAA_ Ivy League_ Harvard and their own school_ Penn_ of conspiring to allow Thomas to compete at conference and national championships.  The lawsuit_ which makes similar allegations to those filed last year by Gaines and others_ alleges the defendants violated Title IX by allowing Thomas to swim “and acted in bad faith.”
287530070,GREENBELT_ Md. — A federal judge issued a nationwide hold on Wednesday indefinitely blocking President Donald Trump’s order to restrict birthright citizenship as the case makes its way through the courts_ saying that “U.S. citizenship is a right no less precious than life or liberty.” “The executive order conflicts with the plain language of the 14th Amendment_ contradicts 125-year-old binding Supreme Court precedent and runs counter to our nation’s 250-year history of citizenship by birth_” U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman said during a hearing in Greenbelt. “No court in the country has ever endorsed the president’s interpretation. This court will not be the first.” The order was set to go into effect on Feb. 19. Wednesday’s preliminary injunction is the second temporary hold against Trump’s executive order. It follows a lawsuit filed two weeks ago by the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project_ the immigrant services organization CASA and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law on behalf of five pregnant women and ASAP and CASA’s members. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the judge’s order. “Citizenship is a most precious right_ expressly guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution_” Boardman said Tuesday. Trump’s order_ which he called “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship_” attempts to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or permanent resident. It states that those born to parents who are in the country legally_ but temporarily_ will no longer be automatically guaranteed citizenship_ including high-skill work visas and student visas. "This administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional_ and that is why President Trump signed that executive order_" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week. "Illegal immigrants who come to this country and have a child are not subject to the laws of this jurisdiction. That’s the opinion of this administration." The plaintiffs in the case called the injunction a victory. “This is the level of fight that will be required for the next four years of the Trump administration_” George Escobar_ CASA’s chief of programs and services_ said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday. “The pregnant women who took this case up against President Trump — and so many immigrants across the country — can breathe easier knowing that their precious children are citizens and afforded the full rights that come with that.” “Today_ the court made the right decision to temporarily block the Birthright Citizenship Executive Order. The Executive Order has created chaos for so many families_ including ASAP members_ who are scared their children will not be able to live a life free of fear in the only country they will have ever known_” Swapna Reddy_ ASAP’s co-executive director_ said in a statement. Trinidad_ a pregnant asylum-seeker and plaintiff in the lawsuit_ said in the statement that “all I have wanted is to focus on my baby being born healthy and safe_ but instead_ even though my baby will be born in the U.S._ I have been worried that they will be denied a right is that guaranteed under the constitution — the right to be a U.S. citizen.” Ahead of the judge’s decision_ multiple pregnant women who would be affected by the executive order spoke to NBC News about how what was supposed to be a time of excitement for their growing families has instead been shadowed by a deep fear that they could be torn apart or that their babies will lack the rights of a U.S. citizen despite being born here. Procedurally_ the Justice Department can now appeal Wednesday's preliminary injunction to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department lawyer who argued the case did not say if the department plans to file such an appeal. About two dozen states have also filed lawsuits against the Trump administration contesting the order_ which experts say violates the 14th Amendment. The Amendment reads_ “All persons born or naturalized in the United States_ and subject to the jurisdiction thereof_ are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” A federal judge in Seattle had issued a temporary restraining order for 14 days on Jan. 23. That case_ and others around the country_ will continue regardless of Wednesday’s order. In that case_ Trump’s Justice Department lawyers told the judge that the order was an “integral part” of the president’s efforts to “address this nation’s broken immigration system and the ongoing crisis at the southern border.”

287557276,Mayor Eric Adams made a last-minute trip to Washington_ DC Wednesday night to attend a prayer breakfast where President Trump will deliver remarks the following morning.   Adams is scheduled to attend the National Prayer Breakfast — an annual event where the president_ Congress members and other leaders break bread in the nation’s capital — Thursday morning and left the city Wednesday night_ according to City Hall.   His visit marks the third time in recent weeks that Adams_ who is facing corruption charges_ and Trump will be in the same room as the Democrat’s legal team lobbies to clinch a presidential pardon or have the case dropped.   Late last month_ Hizzoner skipped Martin Luther King Jr. Day events in the city to instead make an eleventh-hour trip to attend Trump’s inauguration. He also traveled to Florida to meet with the Republican at Mar-a-Lago days before he was sworn into office.  Adams has been careful not to criticize Trump_ including over tariffs the president ordered on Canada and Mexico before a temporary pause was enacted this week. Trump had admitted his tariffs might cause “some pain” for Americans_ but claimed it’d “all be worth the price.”  A City Hall spokesperson downplayed Adams’ scheduled attendance at the prayer breakfast_ noting it’s a bipartisan event that several presidents_ including former President Barack Obama_ have spoken at.   According to the event organizers_ every president “regardless of party or religious persuasion” has joined the breakfast since it was started in 1953.  Thursday_ however_ will be the first time Adams attends the National Prayer Breakfast_ according to a review of his past schedules.  It was not clear who invited Adams to the annual event_ which merges religion and politics_ and if Trump’s team had a role in getting the mayor back to DC.  Trump’s Department of Justice has opened talks between Adams’ legal team and Manhattan federal prosecutors as the under-fire mayor seeks to have the corruption charges dropped in an election year_ a source confirmed to The Post last week.  Even if the DOJ moved to get the case tossed_ a judge would still need to approve the request.  Trump had previously said_ while on the campaign trail_ that he would consider pardoning Adams_ who has denied all wrongdoing.  Hizzoner has been accused of taking bribes — including $123_000 in free flights and other ritzy perks — from foreign nationals in exchange for favors_ according to a federal indictment.   His corruption trial is pegged for April.

287543996,Irv Gotti — who co-founded the hitmaking Murder Inc. Records label and helped make early 2000s superstars out of Ja Rule and Ashanti — has died after suffering a stroke_ The Hollywood Reporter confirmed. He was 54 years old.   Alongside brother Chris_ Irv Gotti launched Murder Inc. in 1998 as an imprint of Def Jam. Ja Rule was the label’s flagship artist_ and Murder Inc.’s first release was his 1999 debut album Venni Vetti Vecci_ which included the rapper’s first top 40 Billboard Hot 100 hit “Holla Holla” (peaking at No. 35).   That was just the start of the commercial success of Murder Inc._ which the Gotti brothers titled after the crime syndicate of the same name. In addition to Ja Rule_ Gotti also discovered singer Ashanti as a teenager_ who went on to find fame with melodic hooks alongside rap hits as well as her own solo R&B success. Ashanti’s three biggest hits all came in 2002: Ja Rule’s “Always on Time_” featuring Ashanti_ was a two-week Hot 100 No. 1; Fat Joe’s “What’s Luv?_” featuring Ashanti_ peaked at No. 2; and her own “Foolish” spent 10 weeks atop the Hot 100.   Murder Inc. also lent their rap bona fides to Jennifer Lopez’s rising music career_ with Ja Rule features on “I’m Real” and “Ain’t It Funny” leading to Hot 100 chart-toppers_ spending five and six weeks at the pinnacle_ respectively.   Between 1999 and 2005_ Ja Rule amassed 17 total Hot 100 hits_ including his three aforementioned No. 1s.   Gotti won a Grammy in 2003 for co-producing Ashanti’s eponymous debut album_ which won for best contemporary R&B album. He was nominated again the following year for co-writing Ashanti’s “Rock Wit U (Awww Baby)_” which was a finalist for best R&B song.   Both Murder Inc. and the Gotti brothers were plagued with legal issues over the years_ including a federal raid at the label’s headquarters in 2003 as part of an investigation linking the Gottis to accused drug lord Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff. In 2005_ Irv and Chris were found not guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to launder money. In July 2024_ Irv Gotti was sued for sexual assault and rape by a Jane Doe plaintiff who said the alleged abuse occurred while she was in a relationship with the hip-hop mogul from 2020 to 2022.
287812956,A federal judge in Boston on Thursday paused nationwide the Trump administration's offer of buyouts to federal employees_ less than 11 hours before the deadline for workers to accept the deal.  Judge George O'Toole Jr._ said that his injunction pausing the plan would continue until at least a court hearing Monday_ where he will listen to arguments on the merits of a lawsuit by employee unions challenging the legality of the buyout.  O'Toole's order Thursday came at a brief hearing_ and as more than 60_000 people — about 3% of the federal workforce — have accepted the offer.

287898304,The Senate confirmed Russell Vought to return as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) after having helmed the agency during the latter half of President Trump’s first term.  All 53 Republicans backed Vought as OMB director_ while every Democrat (47) opposed Trump’s nominee.  “Mr. Vought will have the chance to address two key economic issues — cutting burdensome government regulations and addressing excessive spending_” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) in a floor speech Wednesday. “And the history of the past four years under the Biden administration is a history of burdensome new regulations.”  “Our country is currently on a dangerous spending track_ with debt held by the public set to hit a staggering $52 trillion by 2035_” Thune added. “And identifying ways to rein in our spending – and to target government waste – has to be a priority. And I’m confident that Mr. Vought will help lead that charge.  Vought will now serve at what he has called “the nerve center” of the second Trump administration’s budgetary and rule-making priorities.  He was elevated from the role of OMB deputy director to director during the first Trump administration after Mick Mulvaney departed the agency to serve as White House chief-of-staff.  After leaving office_ Vought briefly advised the hardline Freedom Caucus in 2023_ as its members fought against House Republican leadership for deeper federal spending cuts during the Biden administration.  When announcing his OMB pick last November_ Trump posted on his Truth Social account: “He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term – We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation_ and it was a Great Success!”  Senate Democrats have railed against him as the architect behind a government-wide loan and grant freeze as well as a conservative blueprint for the presidency known as “Project 2025.”  Vought distanced himself from the book during his confirmation hearing_ but Democrats still wielded it and other past statements against the nom in a 30-hour filibuster stretching from Wednesday into Thursday.  Back in August_ several Dem pols had also toted around copies of the project’s 922-page policy tome at their party’s convention in Chicago_ denouncing what they saw as its regressive policies on the federal workforce_ abortion and benefit programs like Medicare.  Throughout the 2024 campaign_ Trump frequently said he had “nothing to do” with the policies contained in the doorstopper put out by the Heritage Foundation think tank.  Vought has also caught flak for his views on collective bargaining agreements with federal employees_ executive branch impoundment_ the effects of Trump’s signature tax legislation in 2017 and his views on 2020 election fraud.  In 1974_ Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act_ which forces US presidents to follow through on spending items approved by the legislative branch.  “The president ran on the notion that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional_” Vought told senators in his confirmation hearing earlier this month. “I agree with that.”  Some federal courts have already blocked Trump’s freeze on the loans and grants_ but the move remains popular among some conservative Republicans.  Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah)_ for example_ introduced legislation last Congress to repeal the Impoundment Control Act_ arguing that it put “unconstitutional limitations” on the executive branch that “contributed to a fiscal crisis” with the nation’s spending outpacing revenues for more than two decades.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and others have accused Trump_ 78_ of running afoul of the law by freezing some funds already authorized by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  On Thursday_ Schumer denounced Vought before the vote as a “hard-right” nominee whose “goal is simply to cut everything almost without regard to how important these programs are so that he can cut taxes on very wealthy people.”  Republicans have countered that the tax cuts benefitted Americans of all income brackets.  In a questionnaire submitted to senators_ Vought had also stated: “I believe that the 2020 election was rigged.”  Vought first served as OMB head from Jan. 2_ 2019 to January 20_ 2021_ leaving the administration to found the Center for Renewing America_ a think tank aligned with the 45th president’s “America First” agenda.

288318588,DEIR AL-BALAH_ Gaza Strip -- Hamas-led militants are set to free three more hostages_ all Israeli civilian men_ on Saturday_ and Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused the war in the Gaza Strip.  President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza_ welcomed by Israel but vehemently rejected by the Palestinians and most of the international community_ does not appear to have affected the current phase of the truce_ which runs until early March.  But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult phase_ when Hamas is to release dozens more hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire. Hamas may be reluctant to free more captives — and lose its main bargaining chip — if it believes the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating the territory_ which rights groups say would violate international law.  The hostages to be released on Saturday_ according to Hamas and Israel_ are: Eli Sharabi_ 52; Ohad Ben Ami_ 56; and Or Levy_ 34. All were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7_ 2023_ that sparked the war.  It will be the fifth swap of hostages for prisoners since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19. Eighteen hostages and more than 550 Palestinian prisoners have already been freed in that time.  The first phase of the ceasefire calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2_000 prisoners_ the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Last week_ wounded Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since May.  Sharabi and Ben Ami were both taken hostage from Kibbutz Beeri_ one of the hardest-hit farming communities in the Hamas attack. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival_ where he was taking shelter in a saferoom when the militants arrived.  The 183 Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel on Saturday include 18 people serving life sentences for committing deadly attacks_ 54 serving long-term sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained after the Oct. 7 attack. All are men_ ranging in age from 20 to 61.  While Israel considers them to be terrorists_ Palestinians view them as heroes battling Israeli occupation. Virtually every Palestinian has a friend_ relative or acquaintance who has been imprisoned.  More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in Nov. 2023. More than 70 are still in Gaza_ and at least a third of them are believed to have been killed in the initial attack or to have died in captivity. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire are dead.  It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas have begun negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire_ which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.  Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas_ even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the latest ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu’s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase.  Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  In the Oct. 7 attack that started the war_ some 1_200 people_ mostly civilians_ were killed. More than 47_000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground war_ over half of them women and children_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry_ which does not say how many of the dead were militants.  The Israeli military says it killed over 17_000 fighters_ without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods.  Of the 72 security prisoners being released Saturday_ five hail from east Jerusalem_ 14 from the Gaza Strip and the remaining 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven are set to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation.   A total of 47 prisoners will be set free Saturday from Ofer prison_ in the West Bank_ and transferred to Palestinian custody at the Betunia crossing point near the administrative center of Ramallah where scores of relatives_ friends and supporters were preparing a hero’s welcome for the returnees.  The Palestinian security prisoners were detained over offenses ranging from bomb attacks to involvement in militant organizations_ in some cases dating back decades.  Among them is Iyad Abu Shakhdam_ 49_ who has been locked up for nearly 21 years over his involvement in Hamas militant attacks in crowded civilian areas that killed dozens of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. That included a notorious 2004 suicide bus bombing in Israel’s southern desert city of Beersheba that killed 16 people_ including a 4-year-old child.   Another is Jamal al-Tawil_ a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh_ abutting Ramallah.   He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli jail_ with the military reporting his last arrest in 2021 over his alleged participation in violent riots and efforts to entrench Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. He was transferred to administrative detention_ a repeatedly renewable six-month period in which suspects are held without charge or trial.  Israel captured the West Bank_ Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.

288243932,WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Friday that he's revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance and ending the daily intelligence briefings he's receiving in payback for Biden doing the same to him in 2021.  Trump announced his decision in a post on his social media platform shortly after he arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home and private club in Palm Beach for the weekend.  "There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore_ we are immediately revoking Joe Biden's Security Clearances_ and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings_" Trump wrote. "He set this precedent in 2021_ when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security_ a courtesy provided to former Presidents."  The move is the latest in a vengeance tour of Washington that Trump promised during his campaign. He has previously revoked security clearances from more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a "Russian information operation." He's also revoked security details assigned to protect former government officials who have criticized him_ including his own former secretary of state_ Mike Pompeo_ who faces threats from Iran_ and former infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci.  Biden didn't immediately comment on the move.  SEE ALSO: Trump tells Ishiba at the White House that he wants to slash the US trade deficit with Japan  Biden ended Trump's intelligence briefings after Trump helped spur efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and incited the Jan. 6_ 2021_ attack on the Capitol. At the time_ Biden said Trump's "erratic" behavior should prevent him from getting the intel briefings.  Asked in an interview with CBS News what he feared if Trump continued to receive the briefings_ Biden said he did not want to "speculate out loud" but made clear he did not want Trump to continue having access to such information.  "I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings_" Biden said. "What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all_ other than the fact he might slip and say something?"  in 2022_ federal agents searched Trump's Florida home and seized boxes of classified records. He was indicted on dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding classified records and obstructing FBI efforts to get them back. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. A judge dismissed the charges_ ruling the special counsel who brought them was illegally appointed_ and the Justice Department gave up appeals after Trump was elected in November.  In his post_ Trump cited the special counsel report last year into Biden's handling of classified documents_ saying_ "The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from 'poor memory' and_ even in his 'prime_' could not be trusted with sensitive information."  He ended his post by saying_ "I will always protect our National Security - JOE_ YOU'RE FIRED. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"  Special counsel Robert Hur investigated Biden's handling of classified information and found that criminal charges were not warranted but delivered a bitingly critical assessment of his handling of sensitive government records. The report described Biden's memory as "hazy_" "fuzzy_" "faulty_" "poor" and having "significant limitations." It said Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice president.  Trump has the right to end the briefings for Biden because it is a sitting president's decision on whether a past president should continue to have access to classified information.
288246882,Chelsea Handler knows it's been a long year already and it's only February.  So_ hosting the Critics Choice Awards for the third time_ she wanted to focus on what there is to be grateful for.  "It's important in times like these to have a distraction_" the comedian said in her opening monologue. "And that's why I want to personally extend my gratitude to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively. Thank you for providing us with that distraction."  Handler was of course referring to the ongoing legal battle between the It Ends With Us costars. Which_ as the emcee also insinuated_ shows no signs of ending anytime soon (though one can always hope).   "I'm grateful_ I think we're all grateful—and I think we're good!" Handler continued. "I think everybody in this room_ no matter whose side you're on_ we can all agree to accept that there's probably not going to be a sequel. It ends with us_ guys." (See all the fashion on everyone who was in the room for the 2025 Critics Choice Awards.)  The 49-year-old also gave herself a self-deprecating shout-out_ noting that her three-year run with the ceremony made it her "second-longest relationship."
288391968,A federal judge early Saturday temporarily restricted access by Elon Musk’s government efficiency program to the Treasury Department’s payment and data systems_ saying there was a risk of “irreparable harm.”  The Trump administration’s new policy of allowing political appointees and “special government employees” access to these systems_ which contain highly sensitive information such as bank details_ heightens the risk of leaks and of the systems becoming more vulnerable than before to hacking_ U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in an emergency order.  Judge Engelmayer ordered any such official who was granted access to the systems since Jan. 20 to “destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems.” He also restricted the Trump administration from granting access to these categories of officials.  The defendants — President Trump_ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury Department — should show cause on Feb. 14 before Judge Jeannette A. Vargas_ who is handling the case on a permanent basis_ Judge Engelmayer said.
288251936,By ANTHONY IZAGUIRRE_ Associated Press  Nineteen Democratic attorneys general sued President Donald Trump on Friday to stop Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans.  The payment system handles tax refunds_ Social Security benefits_ veterans’ benefits and much more_ sending out trillions of dollars every year while containing an expansive network of Americans’ personal and financial data.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency_ also known as DOGE_ was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending. DOGE’s access to Treasury records_ as well as its inspection of various government agencies_ has ignited widespread concern among critics over the increasing power of Musk_ while supporters have cheered at the idea of reining in bloated government finances.  New York Attorney General Letitia James_ whose office filed the lawsuit_ said DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s data raises security problems and the possibility for an illegal freeze in federal funds.  “This unelected group_ led by the world’s richest man_ is not authorized to have this information_ and they explicitly sought this unauthorized access to illegally block payments that millions of Americans rely on_ payments for health care_ child care and other essential programs_” James said in a video message released by her office.  James_ a Democrat who has been one of Trump’s chief antagonists_ said the president does not have the power to give away American’s private information to anyone he chooses_ and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress.  Also on the lawsuit are Arizona_ California_ Colorado_ Connecticut_ Delaware_ Hawaii_ Illinois_ Maine_ Maryland_ Massachusetts_ Minnesota_ Nevada_ New Jersey_ North Carolina_ Oregon_ Rhode Island_ Vermont_ and Wisconsin.  The suit alleges that DOGE’s access to the Treasury records could interfere with funding already appropriated by Congress_ which would exceed the Treasury Department’s statutory authority. The case also argues that the DOGE access violates federal administrative law and the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.  It also accuses Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of changing the department’s longstanding policy for protecting sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information to allow Musk’s DOGE team access to its payment systems.  “This decision failed to account for legal obligations to protect such data and ignored the privacy expectations of federal fund recipients_” including states_ veterans_ retirees_ and taxpayers_ the lawsuit says.  The Treasury Department has said the review is about assessing the integrity of the system and that no changes are being made. According to two people familiar with the process_ Musk’s team began its inquiry looking for ways to suspend payments made by the U.S. Agency for International Development_ which Trump and Musk are attempting to dismantle. The two people spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.  Separately_ Democratic lawmakers are seeking a Treasury Department investigation of DOGE’s access to the government’s payment system.  Also_ labor unions and advocacy groups have sued to block the payments system review over concerns about its legality. A judge in Washington on Thursday temporarily restricted access to two employees with “read only” privileges.  Associated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford_ Connecticut_ contributed to this report.

288266150,By BECKY BOHRER and HALLIE GOLDEN Associated Press  JUNEAU_ Alaska (AP) — A small commuter plane that crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome was located Friday on sea ice_ and all 10 people on board died_ authorities said.  Mike Salerno_ a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard_ said rescuers were searching the aircraft’s last known location by helicopter when they spotted the wreckage. They lowered two rescue swimmers to investigate.  The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet on Thursday afternoon with nine passengers and a pilot_ according to Alaska’s Department of Public Safety.  The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m._ and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later_ according to David Olson_ director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog_ with a temperature of 17 degrees (minus 8.3 Celsius)_ according to the National Weather Service.  Officials lost contact with the plane less than an hour later. The Coast Guard said it went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. The aircraft was 12 miles (19 kilometers) offshore_ according to the Coast Guard said.  It was operating at its maximum passenger capacity_ according to the airline’s description of the plane.  Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m._ the plane had “some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed_” Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. “What that event is_ I can’t speculate to.”  McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater_ the device sends a signal to a satellite_ which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. There have been no such messages received by the Coast Guard_ he said.  All 10 people on board the plane were adults_ and the flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip_ according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers.  Local_ state and federal agencies assisted in the search effort_ combing stretches of ice-dotted waters and scouring miles of frozen tundra.  The plane’s disappearance marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29_ killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31_ killing the six people on board and another person on the ground.  Most Alaska communities are not connected to the state’s main road system_ and airplanes are often the only option for travel of any distance in rural areas_ particularly in winter. The region is prone to sudden snow squalls and high winds in the winter.  Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome_ Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. Two Bering Air planes appeared to be searching in a grid pattern just off the coastline Friday morning_ according to the flight tracking service Flightradar24.  Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail_ route of the world’s most famous sled dog race_ during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound.  Nome_ a Gold Rush town_ is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1_000-mile (1_610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane_ friends and family and those involved in search efforts.  Alaska’s U.S. senators_ Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan_ issued statements saying their thoughts and prayers were with the passengers_ their families_ rescuers and the Nome community. U.S. Rep. Nick Begich said on the social platform X that he was ready to assist Nome and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy “in any way we can.”  Golden reported from Seattle.

288537890,The Los Angeles Lakers' trade to acquire center Mark Williams from the Charlotte Hornets has been rescinded_ the team announced Saturday night. The deal was scrapped "due to failure to satisfy a condition of the trade_" the Lakers announced in a brief statement. The Lakers provided no more details of their reason for scrapping the deal_ but multiple issues popped up on Williams' physical with the Lakers_ ESPN reported. None of the issues were related to his back_ ESPN added in its report. Williams has only played 85 games in his two-plus seasons in the NBA_ missing time mostly due to back injuries. The Lakers agreed to trade rookie Dalton Knecht and Cam Reddish along with draft considerations Wednesday night to get Williams_ a third-year center. Los Angeles needed a big man to replace Anthony Davis_ who was traded to Dallas along with Max Christie for Luka Doncic. Charlotte also was supposed to receive the Lakers' first-round pick in 2031 and a first-round pick swap in 2030. The cancellation of the trade throws yet another element of upheaval into the Lakers_ who have won five straight and 11 of 13 despite their tumultuous roster moves. Los Angeles beat Indiana 124-117 earlier Saturday without LeBron James and Doncic. The Lakers are now without a proven big man to play alongside Jaxson Hayes_ who was expected to move to the bench after Williams arrived. Their backup center against the Pacers was 6-foot-10 Trey Jemison III_ who joined the Lakers less than four weeks ago and has played for four teams in the past two seasons. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
288578132,The Super Bowl LIX live stream can be accessed for free_ even abroad. That’s great news for sports fans who’d like to see a fierce clash between the Eagles and the Chiefs. The Super Bowl LIX live stream will be available on February 9th on Tubi.  Tubi will broadcast Eagles vs Chiefs for free_ with no cable TV subscription required. Moreover_ you’ll be able to stream the game in HD with English commentary for an immersive and exciting experience. Sounds good? We’ll explain everything. Read on.  How to Watch Super Bowl LIX Abroad on Tubi  Tubi acquired the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl LIX. We think this is great news because Tubi is a free streaming platform. To remind you_ other platforms_ like Fubo TV and YouTube TV also broadcast the event. However_ they come with a hefty price tag of $84.99/mo and $82.99/mo respectively.  Tubi_ on the other hand_ charges you nothing but as an American_ you know it’ll work exclusively in the US. This_ at first_ means you can’t watch the Super Bowl LIX outside the US because of the well-known geo-restriction error.  To access Tubi and stream the Super Bowl LIX abroad for free_ you need to pretend you’re in the US. As reported by people online_ this is easily achieved with a VPN. Most notably_ NordVPN which we recently tested with great results.  NordVPN has ~2_000 US servers_ making it a popular VPN for Americans.  Those abroad can use NordVPN to acquire a US IP address and_ in turn_ make Tubi accessible anywhere. This is necessary because Tubi blocks access to people whose IP address is outside the US borders. Logically_ only a US IP can fix the problem.  As mentioned_ the solution is free because of NordVPN’s 30-day money-back guarantee. In recent instances_ people have used NordVPN to watch the Super Bowl live outside the US and canceled the VPN subscription after the match_ getting a full refund.  This is how to watch Eagles vs Chiefs abroad_ anywhere_ for free.  Is Watching Tubi Outside the US Legal?  You can bet it is! Americans abroad or anyone who wants to live-stream the Super Bowl LIX for free can use Tubi with NordVPN.  Tubi requires an account to work but an account is free and takes mere seconds or minutes to create if you’re indecisive about your password.  No one’s going to bat an eye whether or not you’re using a VPN. Besides_ Americans overseas have been using NordVPN for years at this point_ not only for watching the Super Bowl live but also for free streaming of NFL games.  Besides_ we’re sure you don’t want to miss out on the spectacle—a fusion of top-tier American football and Kendrick Lamar pouring his soul into the world-renowned Halftime Show. What a phenomenal combo!  Where Else Can I Watch the Super Bowl LIX?  As an American overseas_ you don’t have ample options. The Super Bowl’s popularity peaks in North America_ where it’ll mostly be broadcast on paid platforms. YouTube TV is a popular one but its juicy price tag deters most users.  In the same fashion_ you can opt for Fubo TV whose plans start at $84.99/mo. Both platforms work exclusively in the USA_ so you’ll still need a VPN.  As long as Tubi broadcasts Eagles vs Chiefs live for free_ paid options make virtually no sense. The same goes for out-of-market NFL matches which you can broadcast anywhere using NordVPN_ like other users.  The Chiefs and Eagles have a 5-5 score so far_ making it incredibly exciting to see which team will prevail. Luckily_ with the simple trick explained above_ you can stream Super Bowl LIX for free abroad without missing a single heart-pounding moment.

But in the second meeting_ it was Du Plessis who pushed the pace_ landed the heavier strikes_ and did the most damage as the pair did battle over five grueling rounds in Australia.In a somewhat slow opening round_ Du Plessis's range-finding shots were enough to outscore a tentative Strickland_ who was warned by his coach Eric Nicksick between rounds that he needed to up his output.But while Strickland raised his pace in Round 2_ so did Du Plessis_ who outworked the American once again through the second five-minute stanza.By the time Du Plessis had done the same in the third round_ Nicksick was clearly frustrated with his man_ and told Strickland that he had 10 minutes to turn the fight around.More news: Paige VanZant Opens Up On 'Incredible Relationship' With UFC Boss Dana WhiteBut the fourth round was Du Plessis' most destructive of the fight_ as a big punch left Strickland with a badly broken nose. Remarkably_ he managed to reset it before the end of the round_ but the damage_ figuratively and literally_ had been done.And in the final round_ it was the champion still pushing the pace as he looked to keep the former champion on the back foot_ defending_ rather than chasing an unlikely knockout.In the end_ the pair battled all the way to the final horn_ but unlike their first fight_ the identity of the winner seemed much more clear-cut.When the scorecards were totaled_ Du Plessis claimed the victory_ and his second straight title defense_ with scores of 50-45_ 50-45_ 49-46.It now puts Du Plessis away and clear at the top of the UFC's middleweight division_ and even though he appeared to address light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira at cageside_ other middleweight challenges still remain.The next man in line at 185 pounds is likely to be Khamzat Chimaev_ who ran through former champion Robert Whittaker in scary fashion in his last appearance. A battle between "Borz" and "Stillknocks" for the middleweight title would produce another great clash of styles if booked for later this year.More MMA:UFC 312 Kicks Off With 19-Second One-Punch KnockoutDaniel Cormier Disputes Jon Jones' GOAT StatusFor more on the UFC_ head to Newsweek Sports.

288640330,Tonight the Kansas City Chiefs will meet the Philadelphia Eagles for a date with history. The Chiefs are trying to become the first NFL team ever to win three Super Bowls in a row_ and the Eagles are eager to stop them and avenge their 2023 loss.   NPR and our member stations in Kansas City_ Philadelphia and New Orleans will have highlights from the halftime show_ the best (and worst...) commercials_ and of course results for you throughout the night.   The game kicks off at 6:30 p.m. EST in New Orleans. Here's how to watch.  🏈 Rooting for the Chiefs?   Head over to Kansas City member station KCUR for the best experience.  "If they win_ this is like Michael Jordan_ 1990s Chicago Bulls-type stuff — history that we will all look back on as one of the greatest runs of any sport ever_ if they can get it done_" says NPR sports correspondent Becky Sullivan.  Travis Kelce_ now a global star thanks to Taylor Swift_ takes center stage at the Super Bowl  TIL: Well into the 00's_ Chiefs home games used to feature a live band  🏈 Rooting for the Eagles?   Head over to member station WHYY in Philadelphia for the best experience.  This time around_ with 14 regular-season wins — and a blowout victory at the NFC Championship Game — under their belt_ the Eagles have another shot at the Vince Lombardi trophy.  BINGO! Play Philly Super Bowl 59 bingo — 2 game boards for Eagles vs. Chiefs  Revenge of the Super Bowl Playlists: Philly Over Everybody  🎉 The food_ the music and the commercials   Even non-football fans will have plenty to look forward to_ from star-studded commercials to a halftime show headlined by Kendrick Lamar_ fresh off his latest Grammy wins.  The festivities kicked off earlier this week with St. Augustine High School's Marching 100 ushered both teams into the Caesars Superdome on Monday night.  Jon Batiste will perform the National Anthem. Check out his Tiny Desk to get in the mood.  🎶 Here's a breakdown of who is performing from NPR's Dhanika Pineda.  Plus_ a Super Bowl riddle: Why are egg prices surging — but not chicken wings?  📺 What to watch for  NPR sports correspondent Becky Sullivan has some tips for what to watch for in this year's game:  A close_ back-and-forth game: All signs point to a close game. The Eagles defense aims to limit big gains and force teams to beat them with small plays. But that's exactly how the Chiefs like to win: Kansas City is 12-0 in one-score games this season. The Kansas City defense is no slouch either_ and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has struggled at times when pressured.   Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes: The key to the Chiefs' three-peat hopes is their 29-year-old quarterback who is great all the time but somehow even better in high-stakes moments: in the playoffs_ on 3rd and 4th downs and on game-ending drives.   The tush push: The Eagles have become known for their unusually successful take on the quarterback sneak. Here are the physics behind the play.  Eagles running back Saquon Barkley: After Philadelphia signed him last spring_ Barkley has blossomed into the game-changer he always had the potential to be. He became only the ninth player ever to rush for more than 2_000 yards in the regular season_ and he has more 60-plus-yard touchdown runs in one season than any player ever.  And some pre-game bonuses: Keep an eye out for Chiefs wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins' arrival outfit_ and whether this Chiefs player tears up during the National Anthem.  More 2025 Super Bowl coverage from The NPR Network  Record-setting legal betting  A record $1.39 billion is expected to be spent on betting legally on Sunday's Super Bowl — up from $1.25 billion in 2024_ according to the American Gaming Association (AGA). It also coincides with warnings from officials to beware of scammers looking to take advantage of the intense interest in the game. Here are two reasons why this year could set a new record.  With the surge in sports betting_ the risk of gambling addiction rises too. Here's what can be done.  "Choose Love"   The NFL has announced it will remove the end zone message "End Racism" for this year's Super Bowl_ replacing it with "Choose Love."  Code Switch's Gene Demby writes about how the change fits into broader discussion happening around DEI.  Omelets and cheesesteaks — for freeThere's nothing quite like a tailgate_ where fans serve food to strangers who share the same passion. We went to a Philadelphia Eagles tailgate to learn what drives this uniquely American tradition.  Despite last month's terrorist attack_ Tourism in New Orleans remains strong  Today's New Orleans is built on — and would suffer greatly without — tourism. About 17 million people visited New Orleans in 2022_ spending more than $9 billion. Much of that happened during Mardi Gras_ which made the New Year's Day attack especially concerning since it happened right before the start of the tourism season. But so far_ a little more than a month removed from the incident_ the tourists are still coming.

288775770,Taylor Swift did not get a warm welcome from the Super Bowl LIX audience.The pop superstar was in attendance at the biggest NFL game of the year on Sunday_ February 9_ cheering on her boyfriend_ Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce_ as his team faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles.In a clip circulating on X (formerly Twitter)_ fans could be heard loudly booing as the 14-time Grammy Award winner's face was shown on the jumbo screen at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans_ Louisiana. Swift_ 35 looked visibly uncomfortable as she shifted her eyes before smiling and seemingly mouthed_ "What's going on?"X users took to the video's comment section to weigh in on the booing_ with many fans going to bat for the singer."Outta pocket let the girl live goddamn_" one person commented."Booing her for something that literally isn't her fault is strange_" a second fan wrote."She did nothing wrong. It's not like she asked for the cameras to be on her_" a third fan wrote.Other people agreed with the crowd's decision to boo the "Cruel Summer" hitmaker.Somebody commented_ "take the hint_ Taylor.""Is she really so oblivious? The NFL fan base isn't her fanbase. Why would people cheer for her?" another individual noted.Someone else wrote_ "this might be the best video of all time."The "Fortnight" singer and the 35-year-old NFL star have been dating for over a year and continue to show support for each other's careers. Swift has attended numerous Chiefs games throughout the season.As for Kelce_ he watched his sweetheart perform in different cities during the iconic Eras Tour.
288806692,President Donald Trump said he will announce on Monday that the United States will impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports_ including from Canada and Mexico_ as well as other import duties later in the week.“Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff_” he told reporters Sunday on Air Force One as he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. When asked about aluminum_ he responded_ “aluminum_ too” will be subject to the trade penalties.Trump also reaffirmed that he would announce “reciprocal tariffs” — “probably Tuesday or Wednesday” — meaning that the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.“If they are charging us 130% and we’re charging them nothing_ it’s not going to stay that way_” he told reporters.RELATED STORY | Trudeau caught on hot mic: Trump serious about annexing Canada as the 51st stateTrump's comments are the latest example of his willingness to threaten_ and in some cases to impose_ import taxes. Tariffs are coming much earlier in his presidency than during his previous four years in the White House_ when he prioritized tax cuts and deregulation. Trump has alternately said he sees import taxes as tools to force concessions on issues such as immigration_ but also as a source of revenue to help close the government's budget deficit.Financial markets fell on Friday after Trump first said he would impose the reciprocal tariffs. Stock prices also dropped after a measure of consumer sentiment declined on Friday_ largely because many respondents cited tariffs as a growing worry. The survey also found that Americans are expecting inflation to tick up in the coming months because of the duties.Trump on Sunday did not offer any details about the steel and aluminum duties_ or the reciprocal tariffs. Trump previously threatened 25% import taxes on all goods from Canada and Mexico_ though he paused them for 30 days barely a week ago. At the same time_ he proceeded to add 10% duties on imports from China.Yet on Friday_ he said he would also delay the tariffs on the millions of small packages — often from fast-fashion firms such as Temu and Shein — until customs officials can figure out ways to impose them. The small packages have previously been exempt from tariffs.
288798702,The Super Bowl is such a huge annual event that it transcends football. A time-honored tradition_ even for non-football fans_ is to check out the Super Bowl commercials. With so many eyes on the big game_ and brands bringing their best efforts_ there are usually a few fun shorts to watch. We’ve rounded up the best Super Bowl 2025 commercials in one place — not counting the movie trailers_ which get their own roundup. Charli XCX and Martha Stewart Spill Secrets After the roaring success of Brat Summer_ Charli XCX shows up in this Super Bowl ad with Martha Stewart_ where the two play a game of “we listen and we don’t judge.” Each participant shares an embarrassing or silly secret of some kind_ and true to the name_ neither can judge the other. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jJckmvAp70&] Unfortunately_ Martha doesn’t have as many interesting tidbits to share as you might think_ considering she’s a felon_ but I always like seeing Charli get some recognition. A second Uber Eats spot has Matthew McConaughey doing his best impression of Mike Ditka_ the legendary Chicago Bears coach. The series of celebrity-filled shorts culminates in Uber Eats’ long-running commercial conspiracy theory that football was invented in order to sell food_ with Greta Gerwig expressing some healthy skepticism. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIoMjrfGy28&t=1s] A mayo-induced orgasm There’s a classic scene in the rom-com When Harry Met Sally when Meg Ryan_ in order to prove a point_ fakes an orgasm mid-meal. This Super Bowl ad has Ryan reconnnect with Billy Crystal in the same deli_ where Crystal remarks that he’s surprised they were able to return. Meg Ryan_ unable to stop old habits_ adds a dose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise to her sandwich and has a similarly over-the-top response. I can safely say I didn’t have “mayo so good it makes you orgasm” on my Super Bowl 2025 bingo card. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIXB-7RHjBY&ab_channel=Hellmann%27s] The Slow and Luxurious Vin Diesel_ Michelle Rodriguez_ and Ludacris all reunite_ but instead of driving in high-speed contests of life and death_ Diesel and Rodriguez are just having a charming drive while enjoying some ice cream. Things can’t always be fast and furious_ I suppose. Frankly_ I’d just like to see this concept expanded into a full feature film. Sometimes I get stressed watching high-octane contests between the world’s most skilled drivers as they learn the meaning of family. It can be a little much. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTppVzG8gpU&ab_channel=H%C3%A4agen-DazsUS] The mustache madness continues at Pringles When I think about Pringles_ I think of the long_ tube-shaped packaging and their logo_ an affable little cartoon man with a mustache. Last year_ Chris Pratt grew a mustache in a Super Bowl ad for Pringles. This year_ the company recruited Nick Offerman_ Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid_ and LA Clippers guard James Harden to watch their famous mustaches detach and fly away on a mission to retrieve more Pringles for a party. A sky full of mustaches flap gloriously onward_ bearing tubes of Pringles. It’s majestic_ if an ineffective chip delivery mechanism. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-nGdi_3_o] Eyebrows a-flying Weirdly enough_ this isn’t the only advertisement that revolves around flying facial hair. Eugene Levy enjoys a treat from Little Caesars_ only for his eyebrows to fly off his face in amazement and go on a world tour. They stop by to visit his daughter_ ambush a jogger_ perch on a baby’s face_ win over some furry worms_ and eventually return to Levy’s face. It’s a novel way to draw attention to a very small-sized pizza snack_ but I’m not sure if I like the idea of associating hair with food. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeAKY73c10&t=1s&ab_channel=LittleCaesarsPizza] Coffee-Mate’s unnerving concert [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnbrFm-B3QI] Shania Twain lends her vocals to a short advertisement for Coffee-Mate’s cold foam_ which allows for a whipped-cream-like layer of luxury to be easily added to someone’s morning coffee. The advertisement proposes that this would be so delightful that it would inspire a metaphorical concert in your mouth_ complete with a tongue writhing and dancing to Shania’s singing. Personally_ I like my tongue to simply register the taste of something_ not flail wildly to a country legend_ but that’s just me. Willem Dafoe_ Catherine O’Hara: Sports icons [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAJW_-i4-kc] A fun spot where iconic actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara take on professional athletes in a game of pickleball_ all to win beer. It’s a silly concept_ but works because it’s Willem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara. Nike: So Win [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o] Nike’s Super Bowl spot highlighted some of the most incredible athletes in the country: A’ja Wilson_ Sabrina Ionescu_ Sha’Carri Richardson_ Caitlin Clark_ and more. It’s a pretty straightforward concept_ but makes the list because of the stark cinematography and general look. Silly sloths struggle with society [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTj2BH0qJjU&ab_channel=CoorsLight] In my personal favorite of the bunch_ Coors paid for a one-minute ad that attempts to capture the slow pace of a post-Super Bowl Monday fugue. In this world_ everyone is a giant sloth_ a noble and majestic beast. However_ these wonderful creatures struggle with tasks like office life_ shopping at the store_ fitting in a workout_ domestic chores_ and more. Frankly_ I’m right there with those sloths; this is highly relatable content. The best gag is probably the “slow-speed chase” at a bank_ where cop sloths slowly lumber after sloth robbers.  [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsqhcNnxfv4] The NFL delivered one of the most dynamic ads of the night with this ‘80s high school movie-inspired ad about flag football_ featuring a villain named Brad and some very nifty moves.
288808760,Patrick Mahomes isn't sure if Travis Kelce will return to the Chiefs next season.   Following a disappointing defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2025 Super Bowl_ Mahomes_ 29_ was asked if he has spoken to Kelce_ 35_ about whether he will retire from football or return to play another season in the NFL.   Speaking to reporters after the 40-22 loss_ Mahomes said he's going to "let Travis make that decision on his own" after he deserves some well-deserved rest following a long season.   "He's given so much to this team and to the NFL_" Mahomes said of the superstar tight end. "And he's been such a joy_ not only for me to work with_ but for people to watch."

"For far too long_ the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents_" Trump wrote on Truth Social. "This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies." He added_ "Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget_ even if it’s a penny at a time." This is the president’s latest move to reduce spending in the U.S. after taking office on Jan. 20. CALIFORNIA FAMILY FINDS 2 MILLION COPPER PENNIES IN OLD HOME The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)_ which is led by billionaire Elon Musk_ posted on X last month that producing the penny is costing American taxpayers tens of millions of dollars_ suggesting that it may be one of the items it may consider eliminating. Musk’s initiative_ aimed at cutting $2 trillion in federal spending_ didn’t directly state that the penny would be eliminated_ but highlighted that it costs three times more to make than it’s actually worth. According to the U.S. Mint_ each penny costs 3.69 cents to produce in fiscal year 2024_ costing taxpayers $119 million. This marked the 19th consecutive year in which production exceeded its face value. 3 REASONS WHY ELON MUSK WANTS TO GET RID OF THE PENNY CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In the U.S._ the penny was one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792.

289022940,By ZEKE MILLER_ AP White House Correspondent  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for U.S. “ownership” of the war-torn territory_ contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population.  Less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in “the Riviera of the Middle East_” Trump_ in an interview with FOX News’ Bret Baier that was set to air on Monday_ said “No_ they wouldn’t” when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would be have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states_ especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt_ to take in Palestinians from Gaza_ who claim the territory as part of a future homeland.  “We’ll build safe communities_ a little bit away from where they are_ where all of this danger is_” Trump said. “In the meantime_ I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.”
289036780,Hamas has indefinitely postponed the release of Israeli hostages who were set to be freed from the Gaza Strip this weekend_ a spokesman said on Monday_ accusing Israel’s government of violating an already fragile cease-fire agreement.  In a statement on Telegram_ Abu Obeida_ the spokesman for Hamas’s military wing_ accused Israel of a host of violations of the cease-fire agreement.  The move threatens to derail the cease-fire agreement reached last month. Widespread anger over the conditions some of the hostages who have been released so far — malnourished_ buffeted by hostile crowds_ paraded before cameras and in some cases made to read statements under duress — has drawn accusations in Israel that Hamas was not complying with the cease-fire agreement.  A spokesman for Israel’s defense minister_ Israel Katz_ called Hamas’s announcement “a complete violation of the cease-fire agreement and the hostage release deal.”
289135074,Washington — The Department of Justice told federal prosecutors in New York to drop their corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Monday sent a memo instructing prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to abandon the charges.The stunning decision comes after department lawyers met with Adams' attorneys and Manhattan federal prosecutors in late January_ where senior officials discussed dropping the charges against the embattled mayor. In September_ Adams was indicted on five counts including bribery_ conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The mayor's trial is scheduled to begin in April. The decision to drop the charges will still need to be formally submitted by prosecutors and approved by the judge overseeing the case. Since his indictment_ Adams has cozied up to President Trump and members of his administration_ meeting with Mr. Trump in Florida before he took office and attending his inauguration in Washington_ D.C. The mayor also attended the National Prayer Breakfast in the capital last week. Adams said that he did not discuss his corruption case with Mr. Trump in their Florida meeting.Federal immigration agents have stepped up enforcement operations across the country_ including in New York. But the city has largely avoided being targeted by the Trump administration_ which sued Chicago and the state of Illinois over their immigration policies last week. City Hall sources recently told CBS News New York that they believed the city was spared because of the mayor's relationship with the White House.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently said that Adams has been cooperative with DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement_ or ICE.Adams has stressed that DHS operations in the city are targeting violent criminals_ and said in late January that he had directed the NYPD to assist federal law enforcement with a "targeted operation" to arrest a suspected gang member."As I have repeatedly said_ we will not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice — just as we have done for years_" he said in a statement on Jan. 28. "Our commitment to protecting our city's law-abiding residents_ both citizens and immigrants_ remains unwavering."But his willingness to cooperate with federal authorities has raised alarms among some state lawmakers and advocacy groups_ who have criticized a memo Adams issued before Mr. Trump's inauguration detailing how city officials should interact with federal immigration agents. The memo included a line that said: "[If] you reasonably feel threatened or fear for your safety_ you should give the officer the information they have asked for or let them enter the site." New York is a "sanctuary city_" meaning local officials and resources can't be used to aid civil immigration enforcement_ with exceptions for violent criminals. Adams' critics said his memo opened the door to city officials violating sanctuary city laws. A City Hall spokesperson said the instructions were not meant to be blanket guidance for every city agency.Adams is one of four mayors who have been called to testify before Congress on March 5 by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer as part of his investigation into sanctuary cities.In his criminal case_ Adams was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations_ as well as flight upgrades and other travel benefits_ from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals who were attempting to influence his decision-making. Multiple members of his administration have been investigated and charged in the probe. One of Adams' former City Hall aides agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from the investigation last week.In January_ federal prosecutors hinted that additional charges might be coming against the mayor_ saying in a court filing that investigators have "continued to identify additional individuals involved in Adams' conduct_ and to uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams." Court records showed that the grand jury in the case heard from new witnesses as recently as December.Adams has claimed that he was prosecuted by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden because he criticized Biden's immigration policies. Mr. Trump has hinted that he would be open to pardoning Adams_ saying in a press conference in mid-December that he didn't "know the facts" of Adams' case but thought "that he was treated pretty unfairly."
289381452,Steve Bannon pleaded guilty to a state charge on Tuesday for his role in a plot to defraud donors to a nonprofit devoted to building a wall on the country's southern border.Bannon won't serve time behind bars under the plea agreement_ which was laid out during a hearing in a New York courtroom on Tuesday. In exchange for pleading guilty to one count of scheming to defraud in the first degree_ he received a sentence of conditional discharge for three years. The sentence means he can't serve as the director of any nonprofit in New York or raise money for charities with assets in the state. He was also forbidden from using donor data stemming from the scheme.The plea brings to an end a matter that began during President Trump's first administration_ just as Mr. Trump has vowed again to beef up border barriers in the early days of his new presidency.Bannon was charged in September 2022 for his role in an organization that raised millions for an effort to privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon and the group_ which was called We Build the Wall_ were accused of defrauding donors of $15 million in donations_ though Bannon's lawyer said Tuesday he didn't personally pocket any of the money.Bannon attended the hearing in his usual courtroom attire_ a brown jacket and untucked black button-down shirt_ over gray jeans. He was charged with two counts of money laundering in the second degree_ two counts of conspiracy in the fourth degree_ a scheme to defraud in the first degree and conspiracy in the fifth degree. Under the plea agreement_ Bannon entered a guilty plea to just the first degree scheme to defraud charge.Bannon also waived his right to appeal the case.Bannon was indicted on federal charges in a similar case in August 2020. That case came to an abrupt halt when Bannon was pardoned by Mr. Trump in the final hours of his first term in office. Mr. Trump's pardon authority extends to federal matters_ meaning he is not able to pardon Bannon in this case_ which is in a New York State court. Bannon served four months in a federal prison in 2024_ after he was found guilty in 2022 of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to appear before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bannon has decried all the cases against him_ claiming they were driven by political animus.The charges against him in New York were brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg_ whose office last year obtained the only criminal conviction in American history of a former or future president. In that case_ Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a matter dating back to his first campaign for president_ in 2016.The case_ which Mr. Trump has appealed_ promises to put Bragg and his office at the center of heightened scrutiny as Mr. Trump and his senior Justice Department leadership vow to investigate those who investigated him.It's a cause with wide support among the president's most fervent supporters_ including Bannon.
289153018,Google Maps officially updated the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on Monday.  Among many other executive orders_ President Donald Trump decreed on the day of his inauguration that the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America. This executive order also reverses an Obama-era move to rename Mount McKinley to Denali_ the name that Indigenous people have used for centuries. Similarly_ the name Gulf of Mexico has been the most prevalent name for the body of water since the 16th century.  The president stated that these names are part of a gesture toward “[restoring] American pride in the history of American greatness.”  As of Monday afternoon_ Google Maps users in the United States will see the Gulf of Mexico’s name changed to be the Gulf of America. International users will see both names_ while Mexican users will only see the Gulf of Mexico. Google already stated in January that it would comply with Trump’s executive order once the place names were updated in the United States’ Geographic Names Information System.  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would send a letter to Google questioning the company’s decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico on Google Maps. But Google’s decision to change the name of the gulf is consistent with its existing policies around how to navigate naming differences between countries. Google changes Maps to align with the user’s local government.   While Google has complied with Trump’s order_ Apple has not yet updated the name of the Gulf of Mexico or Denali on its Maps app. When searching “Gulf of America” on Apple Maps_ the app did not yield any results.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook both attended Trump’s inauguration; Cook personally donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund_ while Google also made a $1 million contribution.

289162862,A plane owned by Mötley Crüe vocalist Vince Neil is reportedly at the center of a fatal plane crash in Scottsdale_ AZ.   The incident reportedly occurred at 2:45pm on Monday (Feb. 10) when a Bombardier Learjet 35A arriving from Austin_ TX veered off the runway after landing at Scottsdale Municipal Airport and crashed into a Gulfstream G-200 business jet parked nearby on private property. One person was reported deceased following the crash_ with four others suffering injuries.   A press briefing from Scottsdale Fire Capt. Dave Folio attributed the incident to faulty landing gear.    Jet Pros Director of Operations Gus Toulatos_ who operates the Gulfstream_ issued a statement noting that no injuries occurred aboard their plane but confirmed the extensive exterior damage.   “We are cooperating fully with airport authorities and relevant agencies as they conduct a thorough review of the situation_” Toulatos said. “We appreciate the swift response of airport personnel and will provide updates as more information becomes available.”   Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky also issued a response to the tragedy_ confirming the details of the event and noting that the airport remained closed at the time of her statement.   “We are closely monitoring the situation_ and we are in touch with airport_ police and federal agencies and will update the community as we have further information_” Borowsky said.   “On behalf of the city of Scottsdale_ we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment.

289152392,Feb. 10 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump signed an order Monday to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States as he works to protect domestic industries that helped him win key states during last year's election.  "This is a big deal. The beginning of making America rich again_" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.  "It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions. That's all countries_ no matter where it comes from_ all countries_" Trump added.  The United States gets most of its steel -- used for cars_ appliances and infrastructure -- from Canada_ Mexico and Brazil. China_ the world's largest producer_ exports less than 2% of its steel to the United States.  The latest tariffs come one week after the president suspended 25% tariffs on all imports coming from Canada and Mexico until at least March 1.  On Sunday aboard Air Force One_ Trump tipped reporters to his steel tariff order and said he would also hold a news conference sometime this week to introduce new reciprocal tariffs.  "Very simply_ if they charge us_ we charge them_" Trump said. "It'll be great for everyone_ including the other countries."  During his first term_ Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum_ which slowed imports and boosted domestic production.  On Monday_ Trump told reporters the new tariffs would also close loopholes and eliminate exemptions that importers have used to "take advantage" of U.S. businesses.  The United Steelworkers Union_ which represents 850_000 workers_ issued a statement Monday applauding the order.  "Our union welcomes President Donald Trump's efforts to contain the global overcapacity that has for too long enabled bad actors like China to flood the global market with its unfairly traded products_ resulting in surging imports into the United States_ especially from Mexico_" said USW International President David McCall.  "Steel and aluminum serve as the backbone of our critical infrastructure and national security_ and strong domestic industries have for generations enabled our nation to build bridges_ supply power_ outfit our military and more_" added McCall.  While USW praised the steel tariffs_ it also urged a "measured approach" to protect relations with allies_ "like Canada_ who play by the rules."  "Canada is not the problem. Indeed_ Canada has taken steps to coordinate their trade policies with the United States to respond to unfair foreign trade_ and applying across-the-board tariffs ultimately hurts workers on both sides of the border_" said McCall.  Last week_ Trump imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports to the United States. After China retaliated with tariffs on metals and certain chips_ Trump paused tariffs on goods valued at $800 or less as the Commerce Department works to develop a tracking system.  "We must distinguish between trusted trade partners_" McCall warned Monday_ "and those who are seeking to undercut our industries as they work to dominate the global market."
289158656,In a memorandum signed by Hegseth_ the old name of the base was restored. However_ instead of being named after Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg_ it is being renamed after Pfc. Roland L. Bragg_ a World War II soldier who earned the Silver Star after driving a stolen German ambulance 20 miles to an Allied hospital during the Battle of the Bulge_ which took place just over 80 years ago.  “Fort Bragg is back_” Hegseth proclaimed.  Fort Bragg was founded as an artillery training ground in 1918_ named after Braxton Bragg_ who was born in North Carolina. The choice of the name was unique_ as Braxton Bragg is widely considered one of the worst generals of the Civil War. He lost nearly every major engagement he took part in.  It was repurposed during World War II and the Cold War as the home of airborne and special operations forces and currently houses the famous 75th Ranger Regiment and 82nd Airborne Division. The base has expanded into one of the largest military bases on Earth_ with 52_000 military personnel.  The base became a target of the Biden administration’s initiative to rename all military installations that bore the names of Confederate military generals_ largely in response to the riots surrounding the death of George Floyd. It was renamed Fort Liberty after a ceremony in the summer of 2023.  President Donald Trump previously vowed to change the names of military installations back. However_ Fort Bragg represents a compromise_ possibly due to Braxton Bragg’s poor historical record.

289139864,Donald Trump says the Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if all remaining Israeli hostages are not returned by noon on Saturday – as he warned Hamas that “all hell is going to break out”.  The US president’s intervention came hours after Hamas has said it will delay the release of more hostages and accused Israel of violating their ceasefire deal.  While signing a series of new executive orders_ Mr Trump said he feared many Israeli hostages scheduled for release are already dead.  Referring to his Saturday deadline for the release of hostages_ Mr Trump said: “If they’re not here_ all hell is going to break out.”  He acknowledged that a decision to end the ceasefire was up to Israel_ adding: “I’m speaking for myself. Israel can override it.”  Hours earlier_ Mr Trump said Palestinians would not have the right to return under his plan for US “ownership” of Gaza – contradicting officials in his administration who said they would be relocated temporarily.  Trump latest: ‘Palestinians will have no right to Gaza return’  Hamas halts release of hostages  Earlier on Monday_ Hamas claimed ceasefire violations had included “delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip_ and targeting them with shelling and gunfire”.  Spokesman Abu Obeida said Hamas remained committed if Israel kept to the terms_ but that the 15 February handover was postponed “until the occupation commits to and compensates for the past weeks”.  Egyptian security sources told Reuters that mediators now fear the deal will break down.  They said Hamas believes Israel isn’t serious about the ceasefire – which began on 19 January.  The last hostage release took place at the weekend and saw three Israeli men set free. Five Thai citizens released last month were also finally reunited with their families in Bangkok.  They were among about 250 people taken during the 7 October 2023 attack_ when 1_200 people were murdered.  Five swaps have taken place so far_ with 21 hostages and more than 730 Palestinian prisoners released.  Saturday’s exchange was due to involve three more Israelis and hundreds of Palestinians.  Defence minister Israel Katz said any delay in releasing hostages would be “a complete violation” and he had instructed troops to be on highest alert.  The Hostages and Missing Family Forum called on mediating countries to restore the deal_ saying “time is of the essence” and citing “the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday”.  Read more:Trump plan so outrageous it might be part of something bigger Israeli police confiscate books in raid on Palestinian bookshops  As part of the ceasefire deal_ Israeli forces pulled back from a key passage through Gaza on Sunday.  The four-mile-long Netzarim corridor separates northern Gaza from the south_ and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have now crossed back over.  However_ Israel pushed back the withdrawal by a few days in protest at the chaotic release of hostages Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses.  This may be what Hamas is referencing what it talks of “delaying the return of the displaced”.  There have also been examples of Israeli troops shooting at or near Palestinians approaching Israeli forces after being warned to stay back.  So far_ little progress has been made on an extension to the first six-week phase of the ceasefire.  A delegation from Israel has arrived in Qatar for further talks amid concern the deal might collapse before all remaining hostages are freed.  Israel has previously said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas’s military and political capabilities are eliminated.  Hamas has countered that it will not hand over the final hostages until Israel removes all its troops from Gaza.

289796106,Washington — President Trump said Wednesday that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and directed members of his national security team to "immediately" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.The call between Mr. Trump and Putin is the first known conversation between the two since the president returned to the White House for a second term. It comes a day after Russia released Pennsylvania schoolteacher Marc Fogel_ who was serving a 14-year sentence and was designated as wrongfully detained late last year."I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia_" the president wrote on Truth Social. "We discussed Ukraine_ the Middle East_ Energy_ Artificial Intelligence_ the power of the Dollar_ and various other subjects."Mr. Trump said he and Putin talked about the "great benefit that we will someday have in working together" and agreed on the need to end Russia's war with Ukraine. In addition to the pledge to begin discussions on the war in Ukraine_ the president and his Russian counterpart said they would visit "each other's nation."The president said he has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio_ CIA Director John Ratcliffe_ national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to lead negotiations on the war. Mr. Trump also said he will call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday "to inform him of the conversation" with Russia's leader."Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President_ but it did happen_ so it must end. No more lives should be lost!" he wrote.
289550326,Marc Fogel_ an American teacher who was deemed wrongfully detained by Russia_ has been released in what the White House described as a diplomatic thaw that could advance negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.  Fogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. His family and supporters said he had been traveling with medically prescribed marijuana_ and he was designated by former US President Joe Biden’s administration as wrongfully detained in December.  Michael Waltz_ US President Donald Trump’s national security adviser_ said the U.S. and Russia “negotiated an exchange” to ensure Fogel’s release. He did not say what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. Previous negotiations have occasionally involved reciprocal releases of Russians by the U.S. or its allies.   Waltz said the development was “a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.” Trump_ a Republican_ has promised to find a way to end the conflict.  Trump also has talked about having a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin_ who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Last month_ Trump said his administration was having “very serious” conversations with Russia about the war.   Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday_ Trump said_ “We were treated very nicely by Russia_ actually. I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.”  Asked whether the U.S. had given up anything in return_ Trump replied “not much” but did not elaborate.  Fogel’s relatives said they were “beyond grateful_ relieved and overwhelmed” that he was coming home.   “This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives_ but today_ we begin to heal_” they said. “For the first time in years_ our family can look forward to the future with hope.”  There was no immediate comment from Moscow about Fogel’s release on Tuesday.

289669494,India’s headline inflation dipped year-on-year for a third straight month to 4.31% in January_ providing more room for monetary easing after the country’s central bank cut rates for the first time in nearly five years last week.  The January reading was the lowest since August 2024_ and came below expectations of 4.6% from economists polled by Reuters.  While price growth cooled across the board_ food price inflation declined significantly from 7.69% in December to 5.68% in January. The annual price growth for vegetables saw the biggest decline from 26.56% in December to 11.35% in January.  “Looking ahead_ good soil conditions_ healthy reservoir levels and a high base means that we expect food inflation to continue slowing over the coming months_” said Harry Chambers_ an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “And with the economy in a softer patch_ underlying price pressures should remain in check.”  A drop in inflation could clear the way for another rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India_ which slashed the repo rate to 6.25% from 6.5% on Friday in its bid to boost a slowing economy.
289708504,BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration_ as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine’s government.  Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey_ before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth’s predecessor_ former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin_ set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.  Over nearly three years_ around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.  No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting_ if one is called.  Hegseth wasn’t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.  His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24_ 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t stop at Ukraine’s borders if he wins_ and that Europe’s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.  U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He’s complained that it’s costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals_ energy and other resources.  Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren’t favorable to Ukraine. On top of that_ Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine’s security going forward.  Washington’s 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump’s new administration has in store for the world’s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn’t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.  NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee_ and it’s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.  Ukraine’s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine_ and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.  However_ a third of members still haven’t reached that threshold_ and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently_ Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP_ a level that no member has reached so far — not even Poland_ which is the closest_ spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.  Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday_ Hegseth wouldn’t commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and “should not go lower than 3 percent.”  He said any final decision would be up to Trump_ but added that “we live in fiscally constrained times” and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.  NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit_ in The Hague_ Netherlands_ on June 24-26.  Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report from Washington.
289639824,LOS ANGELES -- Anthony Mackie is a longtime member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We first started seeing him as Sam Wilson and his alter ego Falcon more than a decade ago.  In "Captain America: Brave New World_" he's gotten a promotion - he's our newest Captain America.  Actor Chris Evans_ as Steve Rogers_ passed the shield to him at the end of "Avengers: Endgame." Mackie says it's been a comfortable transition.  "Once I got over the emotional part_ it was very easy_" said Mackie. "Sam Wilson is already a connected_ created character. There was only a costume change. That's the only difference."  But Mackie's Captain America can do something the last one couldn't: fly! He says director Julius Onah had plans to take advantage of that skill in this movie.  "Julius had a very good_ clear idea of what he wanted to do with these wings and with this suit and expand the reality of Sam Wilson. He wanted to make him more of an aerial-like combat specialist_" said Mackie.  Fighting aside_ Mackie loved working with Harrison Ford_ who plays the new president in the film.  "Literally_ we would get together before every scene_ go through the lines_ you know_ figure out what we're trying to convey... We worked on it like it was a play_ like we were actors in a play group_ you know_ working on a script. So it was amazing_" said Mackie.  "I love what I do_" Mackie added. "I always say that I'm so lucky to make a living at what I wanted to do since I was seven years old."  "Captain America: Brave New World" is in theaters Feb. 14.  The Walt Disney Company is the parent company of National Geographic_ Disney+_ Hulu and this ABC station.
289834898,R. Kelly’s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions_ along with a 30-year prison sentence_ were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.  The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.  The Grammy-winning_ multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges_ including racketeering and sex trafficking.  Attorney Jennifer Bonjean_ representing R. Kelly_ said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling “unprecedented_” saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law “to situations absurdly remote” from the statute’s intent.  Last year_ the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.  The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly’s arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate_ the constitutionality of some state laws used against him was questionable_ four jurors were biased_ the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.  “Enabled by a constellation of managers_ assistants_ and other staff for over twenty-five years_ Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp_” the appeals court said_ noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.  “Evidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family_ control nearly every aspect of their lives_ and abuse them verbally_ physically_ and sexually_” the three-judge panel said.  The appeals court said it was “neither arbitrary nor irrational” that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD_ and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.  “None of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts_” the appeals court said.  The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos.  The videos_ the appeals court said_ “were properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise_ including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.”  Bonjean_ in her statement on R. Kelly’s behalf_ also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge_ Richard J. Sullivan_ concurred with what he described as the majority’s “excellent opinion_” but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.  “This was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony_” Bonjean said.  Kelly_ born Robert Sylvester Kelly_ is known for work including the 1996 hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and the cult classic “Trapped in the Closet_” a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.  Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.   He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008_ but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.  Widespread outrage over Kelly’s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning_ reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.”
290029886,The Senate is expected on Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary in President Donald Trump's cabinet. The final showdown over Kennedy's controversial nomination was set in motion after the Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday - in a 53-47 party-line vote - invoked cloture_ which started the clock ticking toward the final confirmation roll call. Kennedy_ the well-known vaccine skeptic and environmental crusader who ran for the White House in 2024 before ending his bid and endorsing Trump_ needs a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate. TRUMP HEALTH SECRETARY NOMINEE RFK JR. SURVIVES HEATED HEARINGS Kennedy survived back-to-back combustible Senate confirmation hearings late last month_ when Trump's nominee to lead 18 powerful federal agencies that oversee the nation's food and health faced plenty of verbal fireworks over past controversial comments_ including his repeated claims in recent years linking vaccines to autism_ which have been debunked by scientific research. During the hearings_ Democrats also spotlighted Kennedy's service for years as chair or chief legal counsel for Children's Health Defense_ the nonprofit organization he founded that has advocated against vaccines and sued the federal government numerous times_ including a challenge over the authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine for children. HEAD HERE FOR LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE With Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee voting not to advance Kennedy_ the spotlight was on Sen. Bill Cassidy_ R-La._ a physician and chair of the Senate Committee on Health_ Education_ Labor and Pensions (HELP). Cassidy issued a last minute endorsement before the committee level vote_ giving Kennedy a party-line 14-13 victory to advance his confirmation to the full Senate. Cassidy had emphasized during Kennedy's confirmation hearings that "your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me_" which left doubt about his support. However_ after speaking again with the nominee_ Cassidy rattled off a long list of commitments Kennedy made to him_ including quarterly hearings before the HELP Committee; meetings multiple times per month; that HELP Committee can choose representatives on boards or commissions reviewing vaccine safety; and a 30-day notice to the committee_ plus a hearing_ for any changes in vaccine safety reviews. "These commitments_ and my expectation that we can have a great working relationship to make America healthy again_ is the basis of my support_" the senator said. Earlier this week_ another Republican senator who had reservations regarding Kennedy's confirmation announced support for the nominee. "After extensive public and private questioning and a thorough examination of his nomination_ I will support Robert F. Kennedy Jr._" GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announced on Tuesday. Another Republican who was on the fence_ Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska_ also voted to advance Kennedy's nomination. Murkowski noted that she continues "to have concerns about Mr. Kennedy’s views on vaccines and his selective interpretation of scientific studies_" but that the nominee "has made numerous commitments to me and my colleagues_ promising to work with Congress to ensure public access to information and to base vaccine recommendations on data-driven_ evidence-based_ and medically sound research." Former longtime Senate GOP leader Sen. Mitch McConnell_ a major proponent of vaccines_ also voted to advance Kennedy's nomination. Kennedy_ whose outspoken views on Big Pharma and the food industry have also sparked controversy_ has said he aims to shift the focus of the agencies he would oversee toward promotion of a healthy lifestyle_ including overhauling dietary guidelines_ taking aim at ultra-processed foods and getting to the root causes of chronic diseases. The push is part of his "Make America Healthy Again" campaign. "Our country is not going to be destroyed because we get the marginal tax rate wrong. It is going to be destroyed if we get this issue wrong_" Kennedy said as he pointed to chronic diseases. "And I am in a unique position to be able to stop this epidemic." The 71-year-old scion of the nation's most storied political dynasty_ launched a long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination against then-President Joe Biden in April 2023. However_ six months later_ he switched to an independent run for the White House. Trump regularly pilloried Kennedy during his independent presidential bid_ accusing him of being a "Radical Left Liberal" and a "Democrat Plant." Kennedy fired back_ claiming in a social media post that Trump's jabs against him were "a barely coherent barrage of wild and inaccurate claims." However_ Kennedy made major headlines again last August when he dropped his presidential bid and endorsed Trump. While Kennedy had long identified as a Democrat and repeatedly invoked his late father_ former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy_ and his late uncle_ former President John F. Kennedy – who were both assassinated in the 1960s – Kennedy in recent years built relationships with far-right leaders due in part to his high-profile vaccine skepticism. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After months of criticizing him_ Trump called Kennedy "a man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share." Trump announced soon after the November election that he would nominate Kennedy to his Cabinet to run HHS. The final vote on Kennedy's nomination comes one day after another controversial pick_ director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard_ was confirmed by the Senate in a 52-48 vote.
290060090,Hamas has said it will release Israeli hostages as planned and will implement the Gaza ceasefire deal.  It had previously threatened to delay the next release of hostages after accusing Israel of failing to meet its obligations to allow in tents and shelters.  In response Israel_ with the backing of US President Donald Trump_ had threatened to renew its offensive if hostages were not freed.  But in a statement_ Hamas indicated three more Israeli hostages would be freed on Saturday.  Egyptian and Qatari mediators have affirmed they will work to “remove all hurdles” to ensure the ceasefire holds_ the group added.  Israel is yet to comment on the Hamas announcement.  The ceasefire began on 19 January_ bringing a pause to 16 months of war in Gaza.  In its first stage_ which will last 42 days_ Hamas is meant to free 33 Israeli hostages taken during its attack on 7 October 2023_ which sparked the war.  So far it has released 21 hostages – 16 Israelis and five Thai – in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli custody.

Read more:What you need to know about Trump’s Gaza planThe Israel-Hamas war in numbers  Israel and Hamas are expected to begin negotiations on a second phase of the deal_ which would extend the truce and see all Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza in exchange for the freedom of the remaining hostages – though little progress appears to have been made so far.  Negotiations have been further complicated in recent weeks by Mr Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians so the US can take over Gaza.  When Mr Trump hosted Jordan’s king on Tuesday_ he reiterated his controversial idea_ saying the enclave’s population of over two million would not be able to return but would have a better_ safer future elsewhere.  Mr Trump said: “It’s a war-torn area_ we’re going to hold it_ we’re going to take it… Gaza the way it is_ civilisation has been wiped out in Gaza. It’s going to be a great economic development.”  This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.  Please refresh the page for the fullest version.

289938002,MESA_ Ariz. — If the Cubs bring in a veteran third baseman this spring_ it looks like it won’t be Alex Bregman.  Bregman agreed to a three-year deal with the Red Sox for $120 million_ according to multiple reports Wednesday night.  The Cubs had been interested in signing the two-time All-Star_ but optimism that he would end up in Chicago was waning by Wednesday.  Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer declined to comment directly about Bregman_ or any free agent_ in a news conference Sunday as the team opened spring training.  When asked if the Cubs had the payroll flexibility to make a significant addition this spring_ he said: “Talking about exact budget numbers is always a dangerous thing. But I would just say_ we’ve been really focused this offseason on trying to optimize as much as we can within our budget to make sure that we are a really competitive team.”  Cubs top prospect Matt Shaw is the favorite to win the position battle at third base this spring_ as the roster stands_ but the Cubs have stressed that it will be a competition.  “He just doesn’t have a lot of experience at third base_” manager Craig Counsell said this week of Shaw_ who the Cubs drafted No. 13 overall in 2023. “He doesn’t have a lot of professional experience_ period. And that’s a credit to him. That’s not a knock on him.”  The year he was drafted_ Shaw won the Brooks Wallace Award_ which goes to the most outstanding college shortstop. Last season_ he transitioned to playing primarily third base.  Veteran utility player Jon Berti can also play the hot corner. And in the Rule 5 Draft this winter_ the Cubs selected third baseman Gage Workman from the Tigers.  None of the players who made starts at third base for the Cubs last year are still in the organization.

290297400,Less than a month after pulling TikTok from their U.S. app stores in response to a new law that requires TikTok to divest from its China-based owner_ the social media platform was returning to both the Apple and Google Play stores Thursday night.A Google spokesperson told CBS News that TikTok was restored to its app store. The app also appeared available in the Apple store. CBS News has reached out to Apple and TikTok for comment. The moves come after Bloomberg reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi notified Apple and Google that the new law would not be immediately enforced. There was growing concern among lawmakers and national security officials that TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans or manipulate the content they see on the platform.

290405314,Russia launched a drone attack on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant overnight significantly damaging a radiation shelter_ Ukraine has claimed_ sparking fears of a deadly leak.  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that a Russian attack drone ‘with a high-explosive warhead struck the shelter protecting the world from radiation at the destroyed 4th power unit of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant.’  He said the shelter was damaged but that the fire has since been extinguished. The cover is used to prevent radiation after the 1986 nuclear disaster which sent a radioactive cloud across Europe.  Radiation levels around the plant have not increased this morning_ he added_ with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continuing to monitor the plant.  The agency confirmed that an explosion was heard overnight from the new safe confinement_ which protects the remains of reactor 4 of the former nuclear power plant_ starting a fire.   It said that fire safety personnel responded within minutes_ with no casualties reported_ and added that radiation levels inside and outside ‘remain normal and stable.’  Zelensky said Russia is ‘the only country in the world that attacks such sites_ occupies nuclear power plants_ and wages war without any regard for the consequences_’ adding that it is ‘a terrorist threat to the entire world.’  His warning came after Donald Trump announced that representatives from Ukraine and Russia would meet along with US officials at a security conference in Munich today.  Russia is not officially attending the conference and has not commented on Trump’s claims that talks would be held between the warring parties.   Meanwhile a senior Ukrainian official said ‘talks with Russians in Munich’ were ‘not expected’.   Zelensky is set to meet with US Vice President JD Vance Secretary of State Marco Rubio today.  He is expected to warn the US against trusting Putin after a bombshell phone call between Trump and Putin on Wednesday.  Trump said he had agreed with Putin to start Ukraine peace talks soon and exchange friendly visits – a sea change after years in which the Russian president was internationally isolated.  In the wake of the call_ US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested that Ukraine will not return to its pre-2014 borders nor become a member of NATO.  His statements are widely seen as a major victory for Putin and a devastating blow to Kyiv_ which as a result could be forced to cede vast swathes of territory without the prospect of a security guarantee.  Moscow has frequently accused Ukraine of seeking to attack nuclear power plants with drones_ which Kyiv has resolutely denied.  Wreckage of the military drone that hit the wrecked Chernobyl reactor cover was shown but the type was not immediately clear.  Russian Telegram channels claimed the strike was likely a Ukrainian stunt to derail peace talks.  Bloknot reported it was ‘looking like a Ukrainian attempt to pull apart peace deal negotiations’.  Moscow itself has not immediately responded to Ukraine’s allegations.  Russia previously occupied the site of Chernobyl earlier in the war before retreating.  The 1986 Chernobyl fire remains the world’s worst nuclear disaster. It occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 80 miles north of Kyiv exploded_ sending pollution across Europe.  The incident happened while Ukraine was part of the USSR_ with Soviet officials initially playing down the disaster_ slowing the response.  The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks with the construction of the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement completed in 2018.  Meanwhile the Kremlin this morning accused Ukraine of carrying out an artillery attack on a thermal power plant it controls in southern Ukraine_ which is located near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station.  Russian-installed local officials said the attack on the power plant in the city of Enerhodar had occurred late on February 13 and had left more than 50_000 people without electricity.  Urgent work was under way to try to restore electricity supplies.  Russian news agencies cited a nuclear plant official as saying that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant itself had not been damaged in the attack and was operating as usual.  IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the incident at Chernobyl and recent increase in military activity around Zaporizhzhia highlight ongoing nuclear safety risks.   ‘There is no room for complacency_ and the IAEA remains on high alert_’ he said.

290317292,WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift a three-week funding freeze that has shut down U.S. aid and development programs abroad.  Judge Amir Ali issued the order Thursday in a lawsuit brought by companies that receiving U.S. funding for programs abroad.  THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.  WASHINGTON (AP) — A court order halting the Trump administration’s plans to pull all but a fraction of USAID staffers off the job worldwide will stay in place for at least another week.  U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ordered the extension after a nearly three-hour hearing Thursday_ much of it focused on how employees were affected by abrupt orders by the Trump administration and ally Elon Musk to put thousands of USAID workers on leave and freeze foreign aid funding.  The judge said he plans to issue a written ruling in the coming days on whether the pause will continue.  Nichols_ a Trump appointee_ closely questioned the government about keeping employees on leave safe in high-risk overseas areas. When a Justice Department attorney could not provide detailed plans_ the judge asked him to file court documents after the hearing.  USAID staffers who until recently were posted in Congo had filed affidavits for the lawsuit describing the aid agency all but abandoning them when looting and political violence exploded in Congo’s capital last month_ leaving them to evacuate with their families.  The funding freeze and purge of top USAID officials meant agency staffers are now stranded in Washington_ without homes or agency funding_ and facing the loss of their jobs_ staffers said in the affidavits.  The judge handed the administration a setback last week by temporarily halting the plans that would have put thousands of workers on leave and given those abroad only 30 days to return to the United States at government expense. His order was set to expire by the end of Thursday.  Two associations representing federal employees asked him to continue his stay_ as well as suspend Trump’s freeze on almost all foreign assistance. The president’s pause has shut down almost all of the thousands of U.S.-funded aid and development programs around the globe_ USAID workers and humanitarian groups say.  Nichols grilled lawyers for USAID unions in Thursday’s hearing_ probing how workers were being affected by the stoppage of funding for the agency’s work.  The judge’s questions probed the concept of legal standing — whether the unions can show the kind of legal harm that would justify a continued block on the Trump administration’s plans.  Standing is a legal technicality_ but an important one. A different judge cited it when he sided with the Trump administration and allowed a Musk-backed plan to cut the federal workforce through deferred resignations_ often known as buyouts.  While the administration and Musk’s cost-cutting initiative_ the so-called Department of Government Efficiency_ have taken aim at other agencies_ they have moved most destructively against USAID_ asserting without evidence that its work is wasteful and out of line with Trump’s agenda.  In a court filing_ deputy USAID head Pete Marocco argued that “insubordination” made it impossible for the new administration to undertake a close review of aid programs without first pushing almost all USAID staffers off the job and halting aid and development work. He did not provide evidence for his assertion.  USAID staffers_ in court filings_ have denied being insubordinate. They said they were doing their best to carry out what they describe as vague and confusing orders_ some of which were said to come from a Musk associate and other outsiders.  Agency supporters told Democratic senators earlier this week that the shutdown — along with other administration steps_ including revoking USAID’s lease on its Washington headquarters — was really about eradicating USAID before lawmakers or the courts could stop it.  The employee groups_ the Democratic lawmakers and others argue that without congressional approval_ Trump lacks the power to shut USAID or end its programs. His team says the power of courts or lawmakers to stand in the way is limited at best.  “The President’s powers in the realm of foreign affairs are generally vast and unreviewable_” government lawyers said in court documents.

It is the latest indication that the fragile ceasefire that was signed between the two sides last month teetered on the brink of collapse early this week.  The three Israelis being released are Iair Horn_ 46_ Sagui Dekel Chen_ 36_ and Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov_ 29. All have dual citizenships.  Horn was abducted along with his brother_ Eitan_ who remains in Hamas’ captivity.  The most well known of the 300 Palestinian prisoners set to be released is Ahmed Barghouti_ 48_ a close aide of militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure Marwan Barghouti.  Nearly all the 73 remaining Israeli hostages are men_ including soldiers. About half of them are believed to be dead.  The two sides have carried out five exchanges since the ceasefire began on 19 January_ with 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners freed so far during the first phase of the truce.  The war could resume if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase_ which calls for the return of all remaining hostages captured in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 and an indefinite extension of the truce.

290665476,A lawsuit accusing Jay-Z of rape has been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff who originally filed it.   According to legal documents obtained by Entertainment Weekly_ the Jane Doe plaintiff moved Friday to dismiss her lawsuit_ which alleged that the "99 Problems" rapper_ whose real name is Shawn Carter_ raped a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty in 2000 alongside Sean "Diddy" Combs. First filed in October_ the complaint was amended in December to include Carter's name in December. Representatives for Carter and Combs both denied the allegations.   Carter responded to the suit's dismissal in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. "Today is a victory_" the rapper wrote. "The frivolous_ fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. The fictional tale they created was laughable_ if not for the seriousness of the claims. I would not wish this experience on anyone. The trauma that my wife_ my children_ my loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed."   Carter's statement went on to attack one of the plaintiff's lawyers_ Tony Buzbee_ who has filed several other lawsuits against Combs and also works as a personal injury lawyer. "This 1-800 lawyer gets to file a suit hiding behind Jane Doe_ and when they quickly realize that the money grab is going to fail_ they get to walk away with no repercussions. The system has failed_" the statement says. "The court must protect victims_ OF COURSE_ while with the same ethical responsibility_ the courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence. May the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally."   Meanwhile_ Combs' attorneys also responded to the news in a similar statement to EW. "Today’s complete dismissal without a settlement by the 1-800 attorney is yet another confirmation that these lawsuits are built on falsehoods_ not facts_" Combs' lawyers wrote. "For months_ we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity_ pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit. Just like this claim_ the others will fall apart because there is no truth to them."   The statement continued_ "Sean Combs has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone — man or woman_ adult or minor. No number of lawsuits_ sensationalized allegations_ or media theatrics will change that reality. We will continue to fight these baseless claims and hold those responsible. This is just the first of many that will not hold up in a court of law."   Attorneys for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to EW's requests for comment.   The plaintiff admitted that she "made some mistakes" in her recollection of the alleged assault to NBC News in December. "You should always fight for what happened to you_” she told the outlet at the time. "You should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward."   The plaintiff said that her father picked her up after the incident and that she spoke to Good Charlotte's Benji Madden at the VMAs afterparty. However_ her father said he had no recollection of the incident_ and reps for Madden told NBC News that he was on tour with Good Charlotte in the Midwest and didn't attend the VMAs that year.   Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news_ exclusive first looks_ recaps_ reviews_ interviews with your favorite stars_ and more.   Although this particular case has been dropped_ Combs still faces a number of legal challenges. The rapper-slash-mogul was arrested in September on charges of sex trafficking_ racketeering conspiracy_ and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to all charges. His arrest followed several civil lawsuits accusing him of sex trafficking and sexual assault_ as well as federal raids on his homes that he criticized as "excessive show of force."
290677466,The Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams after a series of top prosecutors resigned in protest this week.  An attorney in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section_ Edward Sullivan_ signed the paperwork Friday evening_ which was required to move forward with seeking the formal dismissal of charges.  Along with another career official in the criminal division_ Toni Bacon_ acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove also signed the papers.  The move ends an extraordinary stalemate between prosecutors in the department's Public Integrity Section and Bove_ who earlier this week instructed prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to dismiss the case against Adams.  That request led to a scathing letter from acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi_ suggesting Bove and other members of DOJ leadership were explicitly aware of a quid pro quo suggested by Adams' attorneys_ saying Adams' vocal support of Trump's immigration policies would be boosted by dismissing the indictment against him.  Sassoon then resigned_ later joined by three other top supervisory officials within the Public Integrity Section in Washington_ D.C._ where the case had been reassigned.  The impasse continued into Friday when many of the section's leaders refused to sign the paperwork and also resigned in protest_ before Bove gathered the rest of the section earlier Friday to tell them that there would be serious consequences if no one stepped forward to sign the paperwork_ sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.  Now that the paperwork is filed_ a federal judge will still have to decide whether the case can be dismissed.  Before the paperwork was filed_ yet another federal prosecutor resigned_ suggesting only a "fool" or a "coward" would file the motion sought by Bove.  "No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges_ or the stick of threatening to bring them again_ to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives_" Hagan Scotten_ the assistant United States attorney for Southern District of New York_ said in his resignation letter.  Chad Mizelle_ Bondi's chief of staff_ pushed back against the defiant prosecutors in a statement Friday afternoon contending Adams' prosecution was politically motivated.  "The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors. Such individuals have no place at DOJ_" he said.  Adams was indicted in September on five counts_ with federal prosecutors alleging he accepted illegal gifts_ including plane upgrades and hotel stays_ from Turkish businessmen and officials in exchange for preferential treatment when he was Brooklyn borough president and later as mayor.  The indictment also alleged Adams received illegal campaign straw donations from Turkish nationals.  Adams pleaded not guilty_ has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed without any basis that he was being politically targeted by the Biden administration_ even though the probe covers many years before Biden was in office.  Adams' lawyer denied there was any quid pro quo between Adams and the Trump administration before DOJ leadership instructed prosecutors to drop the case without prejudice_ meaning it can be re-filed.  "The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie_" attorney Alex Spiro said. "We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us."  Adams appeared with Trump administration "border czar" Tom Homans on "Fox and Friends" on Friday morning.  Following that appearance_ Adams released a statement that said: "I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never. "

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “distressed” at the latest deaths.  ”My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected_” Modi wrote on X Sunday.  Ashwini Vaishnaw_ Union Minister of Railways of India_ said on X that he was “deeply saddened by the unfortunate” crowd crush.  “My prayers are with all those who have lost their loved ones. The entire team is working to assist all those who have been affected by this tragic incident_” he wrote.  Vaishnaw said four trains had been used to evacuate people from the station. Police were on the scene and the situation was now under control_ he added.  The festival is considered the world’s largest peaceful gathering of people. Over six weeks_ a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela_ or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher_ on the banks of Prayagraj.

290953952,CHAMPAIGN_ Ill. – Tom Izzo has his record.  More importantly_ Michigan State can add a big road win to its resume.  The No. 11 Spartans rallied from a 16-point deficit in the first half for a 79-65 win against Illinois on Saturday night at a raucous State Farm Center. That gives Izzo his 354th Big Ten victory to break a tie with Bob Knight for the all-time record.  Michigan State (20-5_ 11-3 Big Ten) closed the game on a 15-0 run while Illinois (17-9_ 9-7) went ice cold down the stretch by going scoreless the final 8:29 and missing its last 19 field goals.  Jaxon Kohler hit four triples while scoring a career-high 23 and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Spartans_ who rebounded from an upset loss at home to Indiana on Tuesday. Tre Holloman had 14 points_ Jase Richardson 11 and Coen Carr 10 while Jaden Akins scored all eight of his points in the second half.  Kasparas Jakucionis and Morez Johnson both scored 17 while Will Riley had 13 for Illinois_ which had a two-game winning streak snapped while being swept in the season series against the Spartans.  Illinois_ which entered Saturday riding back-to-back wins for the first time in more than a month_ landed the first punch of the game. The Fighting Illini made seven of their first 11 shots_ including three straight 3-pointers – the last two by Jake Davis – for a 17-6 lead five minutes in_ leading to an Izzo timeout.  A fourth triple of the game for Illinois pushed the lead to 16 midway through the half before Michigan State put together runs of 6-0 and 13-0 to get within one. Kohler scored seven and Carr six while accounting for every point of the latter spurt.  Although Akins_ Michigan State’s leading scorer_ spent nearly the entire final five minutes of the half on the bench scoreless with only one foul_ Kohler had 12 and Carr 10 while to lead the Spartans_ who went into the locker room down 41-37. Illinois hit six triples in the first half and Jakucionis had two of them for a team-high 13 points.  Michigan State picked up where it left off to start the second half by putting together a quick 7-1 run for its first lead of the game. Jeremy Fears got through the rim for a layup_ Richardson had a breakaway dunk and Kohler knocked down his third triple of the game.  The Spartans were up four quickly out of the break before the Fighting Illini countered with an 8-0 run and were in the bonus with 12:55 to play as Richardson went to the bench with his third foul. Akins scored his first points of the game from the line to spark an individual run. He hit a jumper and a banked in a pair of layups from opposite sides of the rim for eight straight points to knot the score at 60.  Holloman knocked down three shots in less than three minutes and Richardson completed a three-point play but the Spartans failed to create breathing room. Following an official review_ a goaltending call on Akins was overturned and two points came off the board for the Fighting Illini with less than four minutes to play. That meant 13 straight missed shots and the total only continued to grow as Michigan State quieted the hostile crowd. Carson Cooper threw down an alley-oop and Kohler completed a three-point play following an offensive board for a nine-point lead as it was all Spartans down the stretch.  Michigan State will return home to host No. 7 Purdue on Tuesday. The Boilermakers have dropped two straight in top 25 defeats at Michigan and at home against Wisconsin on Saturday.

291412670,By TARA COPP_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees_ upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.  Probationary workers were targeted in late night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired_ David Spero_ president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union_ said in a statement.  The impacted workers include personnel hired for FAA radar_ landing and navigational aid maintenance_ one air traffic controller told the Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday_ he said.  The employees were fired “without cause nor based on performance or conduct_” Spero said_ and the emails were “from an ‘exec order’ Microsoft email address” — not a government email address.  The firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years_ especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay_ long shifts_ intensive training and mandatory retirements.  In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet_ which is still under investigation_ one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.  The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency_ which has led the administrations effort to downsize federal government_ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. News of the firings was first reported by CNN.

291217346,She’s coming back for “SNL.”  Aubrey Plaza_ 40_ made her first public appearance since her husband’s death at “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th anniversary special on Sunday night.   “Saturday Night Live” celebrated 50 years on the air with a three-hour special called “SNL50: The Anniversary Special_” Feb. 16 (8 p.m. on NBC and Peacock) — and Plaza was one of the many celebs in attendance.   Plaza’s husband_ Jeff Baena_ died by suicide on Jan. 3. He was 47.  Plaza appeared onstage at the special to introduce one of the comedy special’s musical performances – Miley Cyrus and Brittany Howard_ who sang a cover of “Nothing Compares 2 U.”  Plaza broke her silence three days after her husband’s passing in a statement from the couple’s family.  “This is an unimaginable tragedy. We are deeply grateful to everyone who has offered support. Please respect our privacy during this time_” the statement obtained by The Post read.  Baena was a writer and director.   His big break came in 2004 when he co-wrote the screenplay for “I Heart Huckabees” with the film’s director_ David O. Russell.   Plaza started dating him in 2011.   They worked together several times in the past_ as the former “The White Lotus” actress starred in Baena’s directorial debut_ “Life After Beth_” a zombie comedy about a man who discovers that his girlfriend (Plaza) has returned from the dead. The film was nominated for the prestigious Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.   The couple married in 2021_ but kept their relationship low key and private. Fans only learned it after the “Parks and Recreation” actress referred to the director as “my darling husband” on social media.  “So proud of my darling husband @jeffbaena for dreaming up another film that takes us to Italia to cause some more trouble_” Plaza wrote in the May 2021 Instagram post.  “The marriage was just like a joke that honestly went too far_” Plaza said on “The Drew Barrymore Show” that year.   “We got married on a whim_” she added. “Literally decided at around 5 p.m. and got married at 8:30.”  Plaza was originally scheduled to present at the 2025 Golden Globes on Sunday_ Jan. 5_ but bowed out after her husband’s passing.  During the ceremony_ which was hosted by Nikki Glaser_ Brady Corbet sent love to Plaza while accepting his best director award for “The Brutalist.”  “Tonight my heart is with Aubrey Plaza and Jeff’s family_” Corbet said at the time.   Plaza has stayed under the radar since Baena’s death_ but the actress_ who hosted Saturday Night Live in the past on January 21_ 2023_ was one of the many celebs who attended the big 50th anniversary special.   Longtime production designer Keith Raywood told The Post about putting together the special_ “We [will] have about 450 people in the studio_ which is essentially about 200 people more than we would normally have.”  This number is for the audience_ since it will be full of the special guests’ friends and family_ he said.   “Imagine all the people who have been on the show – those cast members and hosts. It’s a lot of people [there to see them]. And_ those seats don’t normally exist_” he said.
291203592,For the first time in two decades_ an NBA All-Star Game will take place without LeBron James. The most boring mid-season break in North American sports is taking place at the Chase Center in San Francisco tonight. Not many of the fans care_ because it's obvious that the players give minimal effort. Heck_ it's gotten so bad that the NBA is literally begging players to show some sign of effort in the game. Don’t expect a lot of headlines to come from this game_ it's probably not going to be anything special. However_ one bit of news broke before the game started_ and it came via James. Last weekend_ the Los Angeles Lakers forward sat out his team’s victory over the Indiana Pacers because of a nagging injury. Evidently_ the All-Star break has not given him enough time to recover_ and as a result_ he is sitting out Sunday’s game. "I was hoping it would feel a lot better this morning_ but it was not where I wanted it to be_" James said of his ankle. It will be the first time since the 2003-04 season that James will not appear in the All-Star Game. Normally_ I would call this weak behavior from James. But given that the Lakers are currently No. 5 in the Western Conference and James doesn’t have many more playoff runs in the tank_ this seems like a good choice. "With 30 games left and us trying to make a playoff push in the wild_ wild West_ I felt like it was very important for me to kind of take care of myself and understand what's coming on [down the stretch]_" James said. It’s not like he’s going to miss anything special either_ its basically a glorified pick-up game.
291293886,US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives in Saudi Arabia on Monday ahead of expected talks with Russian officials aimed at ending Moscow’s nearly three-year war in Ukraine.  The talks come after President Donald Trump last week spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone and ordered top officials to begin negotiations on the war_ which he repeatedly vowed to end during his presidential campaign.  Riyadh_ which is also involved in talks with Washington over the future of the Gaza Strip_ has played a role in early contacts between the Trump administration_ which took office on January 20_ and Moscow_ helping to secure a prisoner swap last week.  US top diplomat Rubio_ who spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday_ will meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia alongside Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff_ a US lawmaker and a source told Reuters.   It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia.  Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that the talks would take place on Tuesday in the Saudi capital Riyadh_ citing unnamed sources.  The talks will be among the first high-level in-person discussions in years between Russian and US officials and are meant to precede a meeting between the US and Russian presidents.  Rubio on Sunday said the coming weeks and days would determine whether Putin is serious about making peace.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is also in the region. Zelenskiy_ who arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday_ said he also intended to visit Saudi Arabia and Turkey_ but no dates were set.   He said he had no plans to meet Russian or US officials and Ukraine is not believed to be invited to the Saudi-hosted talks.  Rubio is expected to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) in Saudi Arabia. On the agenda is likely to be Trump’s proposal for the Palestinian residents of Gaza to be resettled in other Arab nations and for the US to lead reconstruction of their home.  That proposal has infuriated the Arab World and heightened fears among Palestinians in Gaza of being driven out of the coastal strip.  Gaza has been devastated by the war that broke out when Iran-backed militants Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7_ 2023_ killing about 1_200 people and taking 250 hostage_ according to Israeli tallies.   The offensive Israel launched in response killed more than 48_000 Palestinians_ according to Gaza health authorities_ before an agreement reached last month brought a fragile ceasefire.  Saudi Arabia_ alongside other Arab nations_ has rejected any plan that involves resettling Palestinians_ and Riyadh is spearheading Arab efforts to develop a counterproposal_ which could involve a Gulf-led reconstruction fund and a deal to sideline Hamas.  MbS has also insisted that Saudi Arabia would not normalize ties with Israel – a longstanding goal of Washington – without an agreement on a pathway to a Palestinian state.  Rubio visited Israel on Sunday and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu_ pledging support for Israel in its regional rivalry with Iran.

291796142,Majima gone wild.  Right off the bat_ Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii makes its premise as clear as the name of the game does. You’re Goro Majima_ the Mad Dog of Shimano… but through the wonders of retrograde amnesia_ he’s a fresh slate who’s ready to pivot to a more nautical adventure. After washing ashore from a shipwreck_ our eyepatch-wearing amnesiac is rescued by a young boy named Noah and becomes embroiled in the island’s local pirate issues.  Yes_ as it turns out there’s a much larger pirate community around present-day Hawaii than you might’ve thought! After taking out the captain of the pirate troublemakers_ the mystery man soon becomes The Captain_ leading the ship on a new adventure with Noah leading the charge.  Even for the Like A Dragon franchise_ this game is pretty goofy (and we just did “secret agent Kiryu” two years ago). But the thing that sets Pirate Yakuza apart is its choice of protagonist. Even without his memory_ Majima is still an unpredictable wildcard at his core. He’s the perfect character to sign on to be a pirate immediately_ and his energy makes him a perfect fit for the pirate community. He’s immediately compelling as Captain_ and you’ll soon find him recruiting random locals to his crew left and right.  One thing the Like A Dragon series has always excelled at is making the most of what came before it. For a long time_ almost every game in the franchise took place in Kamurocho_ the same smallish neighbourhood the evolved in bits and pieces as time passed in the game’s world. Never willing to waste a good thing_ RGG Studio brings us back to their beautiful rendition of Honolulu from 2024’s Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth.  Pirate Yakuza is set not long after the end of that game’s story_ and a lot of its subquests and side events directly follow up on the ones from Infinite Wealth. This is a franchise that loves every single NPC with all its heart_ so it’s always a joy to see how what came before can be bested. More often than not_ this will often end with the folks involved joining your ever-expanding pirate crew_ for adventure on the high seas of Hawaii. That’s where Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii really brings something new to the Like A Dragon franchise: full-on naval combat.  In a move I never expected from this particular game series_ Majima’s solo adventure adds surprisingly robust systems for building up your pirate crew_ and engaging in ship-to-ship combat. Much of the game will see you sailing your ship from island to island in the waters around Hawaii_ and taking down any aggressive buccaneers who get in your way. The crew you recruit can be assigned to the ship’s various cannons_ as well as the boarding crew – when taking on major competitors_ you’ll need to disable the lead ship before boarding to knock the crew about more directly.  Throwing two squads of NPC brawlers at each other in the classic beat ’em up brawler combat of early Yakuza games is always a good time_ but Pirate Yakuza’s naval combat really shines. Managing attacks from all directions and lining up your various shots is a thrill_ especially as higher-level ships start diversifying their attacks to match you.  The bag of tricks you’re handed also keeps fights interesting – you can engage boosters like it’s Mario Kart_ repair your ship if you can survive a few seconds without weapons_ or you can switch to Majima on the deck of the ship to pop smoke and hide yourself_ then fire a rocket launcher directly at the enemy ship from there.  Pirate Yakuza also makes the hits you take really matter; taking cannon fire won’t just damage the ship itself_ it could knock out one of your cannoneers at the same time. You can wear the loss of firepower and try to scrape through doing less damage_ or take the risk of your ship sitting prone while you sprint across the deck to wake that crewmate up again. The balance of all the elements worked really well for me_ especially in the Pirate Coliseum’s ranked matches — or if you really dig it_ the whole side-plot involving a tiered army of evil pirates for you to take down across the seas of Hawaii.  When you’re out and about in Hawaii_ Majima returns to the classic Like A Dragon brawler combat – and ever the combat chameleon_ he’s got two different fighting styles at his fingertips. Sadly the Breaker style from Yakuza 0 doesn’t return_ but muscle memory does give Majima access to the Mad Dog style – agile and brutal_ the Captain and his dagger can focus on a single enemy to take them down quickly.  His stint as a pirate captain also unlocks the new Sea Dog style_ using two pirate cutlasses to take enemies on in groups_ as well as allowing you to block from all directions at once. That last skill is a major help in the game’s frantic group battles_ where attacks can crowd the screen and stop you from planning for any specific strike. Enemies crowd the streets of Hawaii_ but the game’s seamless transition in and out of fights make them feel like a joy to engage in_ rather than something to soldier through.  Given Majima’s loss of identity_ the game also lets him reinvent himself with a full wardrobe_ unlocked from stores or by joining in on the game’s many diversions. You can even give Majima two distinct looks_ for daywear on the streets of Hawaii_ and a more pirate-y look for captaining the ship. Much like in Like A Dragon Gaiden_ it’s just good fun to play dress-ups and see your outfit of choice in the game’s more serious scenes. I eventually settled on a biker look for the streets and a business-piratical look for the oceans_ and it did feel like a very personal achievement as the finale played out in my fits of choice.  I really enjoyed my time with Like A Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii as a way to get to know the character of Goro Majima better. While he’s always a fun time when he shows up_ Pirate Yakuza lets RGG Studio examine what this legendary figure in the franchise would be like with his same instincts_ but none of his backstory.  As it turns out_ the Mad Dog of Shimano is a natural leader_ by land or by sea. It’s interesting to see those same drives for justice and honour to come out_ like the series’ other protagonists_ but with all the safeguards off in Majima’s case. Anything goes on the high seas_ and it makes for a fun victory lap through Hawaii for the Like A Dragon series.  Like A Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii was reviewed using a promotional code on PS5_ as provided by the publisher. Click here to learn more about Stevivor’s scoring scale.
291643530,RIYADH_ Saudi Arabia (AP) — Top Russian and U.S. officials are set to hold talks hold talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in a bid to improve their ties and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.   The meeting between the two countries’ top diplomats in Riyadh would be their most significant since the Russia invaded its neighbor almost three years ago_ and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.   Trump earlier this month upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia_ saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.   Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov arrived in the Saudi capital on Monday night. Ushakov said the talks would be “purely bilateral” and would not include Ukrainian officials.  U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio_ national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will meet the Russian delegation_ State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.   The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won’t be favorable to them. France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to respond.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday his country won’t accept the outcome if Kyiv doesn’t take part.  U.S.-Russia talks would “yield no results” without Ukrainian officials_ Zelenskyy said on a conference call with journalists from the United Arab Emirates.   Ahead of the talks_ Kirill Dmitriev_ the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who the Kremlin said might join the meeting_ underscored the importance of the meeting in comments to The Associated Press.   “Good U.S.-Russia relations are very important for the whole world. Only jointly can Russia and the U.S. address lots of world problems_ resolve for global conflicts and offer solutions_” Dmitriev_ who said he and his team would focus on economic issues at the talks_ told AP.   The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya_ citing the Russian delegation_ described Moscow’s priority as “real normalization with Washington.”  For Saudi Arabia_ the talks are a major step toward a goal de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pursued throughout the war — putting the kingdom in the middle of diplomatic negotiations. It has helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in the kingdom in 2023. Zelenskyy will likely travel to Saudi Arabia later this week.  For Prince Mohammed_ once described as a “pariah” by former President Joe Biden over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi_ hosting such talks burnish the otherwise-tarnished image the West has for him. Like  Ahead of the summit_ the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz described the moment as the “world’s eye on Riyadh.”   Writing in the London-based but Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat_ journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi described the summit as “a major step on the international political chess arena_ revealing the status of Saudi Arabia and its positive influence for the benefit of the people all the people_” he wrote. the neighboring United Arab Emirates_ the prince also has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine_ both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically as well.  Hosting the summit also balances the harsh criticism recently levied by the kingdom’s tightly controlled media at President Donald Trump over his repeated comments that he wants the U.S. to “own” the Gaza Strip_ which has been devastated by the Israeli military offensive there since the Oct. 7_ 2023_ Hamas attack. The Palestinians want Gaza and the West Bank for a future state_ something backed by the wider Arab world and nearly all of the international community.  Litvinova reported from Tallinn_ Estonia. Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai_ United Arab Emirates_ contributed to this report.

291703656,Ten years ago_ Parisian studio Don’t Nod effectively crafted a new sub-genre of narrative adventure with its teen mystery Life Is Strange. Part thriller_ part relationship drama_ it used music_ art and relatable characters to create a touching paean to unshakeable friendship. After a series of sequels_ Don’t Nod’s Montreal studio has crafted a new tale about teenage relationships_ split into two episodes_ or Tapes_ the first of which will doubtless have fans on tenterhooks for the concluding part.  It’s 1995 and introverted teen Swann is facing a final quiet summer alone in the rural town of Velvet Cove_ Michigan_ before her family moves to Vancouver. But in the parking lot of the local video store_ she meets fellow 16-year-olds Nora_ Autumn and Kat_ and the four girls bond over their boredom and frustration with small-town life. Soon_ they are inseparable_ spending their days hiking in the nearby forests_ making camp fires_ confessing their secrets – until they discover a spooky shack hidden out among the trees and decide to make it their base. Here_ they form riot grrrl band Bloom & Rage_ channelling their dreams_ desires and fears into fantasies of fame and revenge on shitty boys and repressive parents. But when their swirling emotions seem to awaken a supernatural presence in the woods_ something terrible happens and the girls swear each other to a lifelong secret.  Now_ 27 years later_ the group are meeting again in a rough bar on the outskirts of town that holds special relevance to their story. Autumn has received a sinister package addressed to their band. Whatever’s in the box may well be the dreadful result of that tumultuous summer.  In a style typical of Don’t Nod_ the game intercuts compelling cinematic sequences with interactive scenes_ giving you control over conversations that subtly shape your relationships and the direction of the story. The narrative swaps back and forth between two timelines – the adult characters reminiscing in 2022 and their pivotal summer together in 1995 – and your actions in one affects outcomes in the other. At times_ decisions you make as 43-year-old Swann at the bar are then retrofitted into her youthful experiences_ creating fascinating ambiguities of causality and memory.  Indeed_ this game is as much about the way we craft and edit memories as it is about what actually happens to the girls. Swann is a keen film-maker and her 1990s camcorder is with you throughout the game; at any point you can hit the right trigger to view the world through the camcorder lens. In the main story_ you’re using it to film a music video for the band_ but you’re free to record whenever you want. This feature is incentivised by a bunch of themed checklists – record 10 different birds_ or five ruined playground rides_ or snatches of graffiti. But you can also capture your own scenes from the town and its environs_ or discreetly record your friends_ building themed sequences that you can then store and edit. Although the interface recalls games such as No Man’s Sky and Marvel’s Spider-Man_ where filming objects is a practical gameplay component_ here the camcorder is also a metaphor for recollection and nostalgia – how trustworthy are these recorded artefacts? At the same time_ the player’s role as both gamer and cinematographer asks interesting questions about how we relate to the protagonists we embody in games.  It’s not the only clever trick the game plays with format and convention. The dialogue system_ for example_ is specifically designed to capture the energy and chaos of the excitable-group dynamic. Options and responses change depending on who you’re looking at as you talk_ characters shout over each other_ and comments get lost in the noise. At times_ you can simply allow the dialogue options to time-out and choose not to say anything. In several wonderful moments this mechanic perfectly captures the desperate improvisational nature of teen relationships_ the way a whole day can teeter on a single comment_ or a fleeting moment of eye-contact.  There are times when the dialogue feels stilted and over-earnest_ and the sense of authenticity gets stretched. Those who’ve played Life Is Strange will also see many parallels with that game_ especially between Swann and Max Caulfield_ both shy photographers using the lens as an emotional security blanket.  But like its predecessor_ Lost Records wonderfully captures how_ in young adulthood_ seemingly insignificant moments can be charged with meaning. There’s a picnic by a lake and later a game of truth or dare that absolutely crackle with intensity. The 90s setting is also well-supported_ with spot-on contemporary references_ from grunge band mix tapes to video players and troll dolls – it’s fun to just pick up objects in the environment and reminisce_ like wandering about some themed pop culture museum.  In the background_ the mystery at the heart of the game is subtly introduced and there’s much to anticipate from the second part. Mostly though_ it’s the characters and their brittle relationships that stick with you. Three days after finishing the game I’m still thinking about them_ worrying about them_ inhabiting that old shack with them. Unless you simply refuse to indulge in emotional young adult drama_ you will be right there_ too.
291790966,In a surprise announcement_ a top Hamas leader says the militant group will release six living Israeli hostages on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday_ including the remains of the Bibas family_ who for many Israelis have embodied the captives' plight in Gaza.  Israel has said it is gravely concerned about Shiri Bibas and her two young sons_ Ariel and Kfir_ but has not confirmed their deaths. Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war.  Kfir_ who was 9 months old at the time_ was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' Oct. 7_ 2023_ attack that triggered the war. A video of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men.  Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya_ in prerecorded remarks on Tuesday_ said the "Bibas family" would be included in the handover of four bodies - the first to be released under the current ceasefire.  The six to be released on Saturday are the last living hostages to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase. Three had been expected to be freed.  It was not immediately clear why Hamas had changed the plan. But an Israeli official_ speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations_ said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza as part of efforts to accelerate the hostages' release.  Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of hostages_ citing the refusal to allow in mobile homes and heavy equipment among other alleged violations of the truce.  The hostage releases have come in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.  The ceasefire that began in mid-January has paused the deadliest fighting ever between Israel and Hamas_ surged aid into devastated Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to their homes as Israeli forces withdrew from much of the territory.  The sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase_ in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.  Major challenges are ahead. Israel's government says it wants to eliminate Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza. But the militant group quickly reasserted its control of the territory during the ceasefire despite losing leaders and many fighters.  In addition_ U.S. President Donald Trump's new proposal to relocate the Palestinians out of Gaza so the U.S. can redevelop the territory has been rejected by the Arab world and by the Palestinians_ who fear they'll never be allowed to return. But Israel has embraced the plan_ and it and the Trump administration have emphasized they share the same goals in the war.  Israelis were horrified by the sight of three emaciated hostages in an earlier release this month_ and revelations about hostages being held alone_ barefoot or in chains have increased the pressure on Netanyahu's government to push ahead with the ceasefire's next stage.  Families and others fear that time is running out -- and the news about the Bibas family confirmed that once again.

291768082,A Delta Air Lines jet flipped on its roof while landing Monday at Toronto’s Pearson Airport_ but all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries_ the airport’s chief executive said. Snow blown by winds gusting to 40 mph swirled when the flight from Minneapolis carrying 76 passengers and four crew attempted to land at around 2:15 p.m. Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it's not clear what went so drastically wrong when the plane touched down. Peter Carlson_ a passenger traveling to Toronto for a paramedics conference_ said the landing was “very forceful.” “All the sudden everything just kind of went sideways and then next thing I know it’s kind of a blink and I’m upside down still strapped in_” he told CBC News. Canadian authorities held two brief news conferences but provided no details on the crash. Video posted to social media showed the aftermath with the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR overturned_ the fuselage seemingly intact and firefighters dousing what was left of the fire as passengers climbed out and walked across the tarmac. “We are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries_” Deborah Flint_ CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority_ told reporters. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement that “the hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected." Toronto Pearson Fire Chief Todd Aitken said 18 passengers were taken to the hospital. Earlier in the day_ Ornge air ambulance said it was transporting one pediatric patient to Toronto’s SickKids hospital and two injured adults to other hospitals in the city. Emergency personnel reached the plane within a few minutes and Aitken said the response “went as planned.” He said "the runway was dry and there was no cross-wind conditions.” The crash was the fourth major aviation accident in North America in the past three weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport in Washington_ D.C._ on Jan. 29_ killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31_ killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And on Feb. 6_ 10 people were killed in a plane crash in Alaska. The last major crash at Pearson was on Aug. 2_ 2005_ when an Airbus A340 landing from Paris skidded off the runway and burst into flames amid stormy weather. All 309 passengers and crew aboard Air France Flight 358 survived the crash. On Monday_ Pearson was experiencing blowing snow and winds of 32 mph gusting to 40 mph (65 kph)_ according to the Meteorological Service of Canada. The temperature was about 16.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The Delta flight was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. Audio recordings show the control tower warned the pilots of a possible air flow “bump” on the approach. “It sounds to me like a controller trying to be helpful_ meaning the wind is going to give you a bumpy ride coming down_ that you’re going to be up and down through the glide path_” said John Cox_ CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg_ Florida. “So it was windy. But the airplanes are designed and certified to handle that_” Cox said. “The pilots are trained and experienced to handle that.” The plane came to a rest at the intersection of Runways 23 and 15L_ not far from the start of the runway. Just after the crash_ tower controllers spoke with the crew of a medical helicopter that had just left Pearson and was returning to help. “Just so you’re aware_ there’s people outside walking around the aircraft there_” a controller said. “Yeah_ we’ve got it. The aircraft is upside down and burning_” the medical helicopter pilot responded. Carlson was among those outside the aircraft. He said when he took off his seat belt he crashed onto the ceiling_ which had become the floor. He smelled gas_ saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew he needed to get out but said his fatherly intuition and paramedic skills kicked in. He looked for those he could help. Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her young son out of the plane and then Carlson dropped onto the tarmac. Snow was blowing and it “felt like I was stepping onto tundra.” “I didn’t care how cold it was_ didn’t care how far I had to walk_ how long I had to stand — all of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft_” he said. Cox_ who flew for U.S. Air for 25 years and has worked on U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigations_ said the CRJ-900 aircraft is a proven aircraft that’s been in service for decades and does a good job of handling inclement weather. He said it's unusual for a plane to end up on its roof. “We’ve seen a couple of cases of takeoffs where airplanes have ended up inverted_ but it’s pretty rare_” Cox said. Among the questions that need to be answered_ Cox said_ is why the crashed plane was missing its right wing. “If one wing is missing_ it’s going to have a tendency to roll over_” he said. “Those are going to be central questions as to what happened to the wing and the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. They will be found_ if not today_ tomorrow_ and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada will read them out and they will have a very good understanding of what actually occurred here.” The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the Transportation Safety Board of Canada would head up the investigation and provide any updates. The NTSB in the U.S. said it was sending a team to assist in the Canadian investigation. Endeavor Air_ based in Minneapolis_ is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines and the world’s largest operator of CRJ-900 aircraft. The airline operates 130 regional jets on 700 daily flights to over 126 cities in the U.S._ Canada and the Caribbean_ according to the company’s website. The CRJ-900_ a popular regional jet_ was developed by Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. It’s in the same family of aircraft as the CRJ-700_ the type of plane involved in the midair collision near Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29. Wawrow and Casey write for the Associated Press.

291805634,RIYADH_ Saudi Arabia (AP) — Russia and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to start working towards ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties_ America’s top diplomat said after talks that reflected an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump.  In an interview with The Associated Press_ Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the two side agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow_ to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks_ and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation.  He stressed_ however_ that the talks — which were also attended by his Russian counterpart_ Sergey Lavrov — marked the beginning of a conversation_ and more work needs to be done down the road.  No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting_ which came as the beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against more numerous Russian troops in a grinding war that began nearly three years ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country wouldn’t accept any outcome from this week’s talks if Kyiv doesn’t take part. European allies have also expressed concerns they are being sidelined.  Improving Russian-US relations  Ties between Russia and the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level in decades during the war. Both embassies have been hit hard by expulsions of large numbers of diplomats over the course of several years_ and the U.S._ along with European nations_ imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia. The allies have repeatedly expanded the measures to damage Moscow’s economy.  “Should this conflict come to an acceptable end_ the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians geopolitically on issues of common interest and frankly_ economically on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term_” Rubio said.  His comments were further evidence of the remarkable U.S. reversal on Russia after years in which Trump’s predecessor_ Joe Biden_ led international efforts to isolate Moscow.  Tuesday’s meeting was meant to pave the way for a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the talks wrapped_ Putin’s foreign affairs advisor_ Yuri Ushakov_ told Russia’s Channel One that no date has been set yet for that summit but that it was “unlikely” to take place next week.  Speaking to reporters after the meeting_ Lavrov said that in his view_ “the conversation was very useful.” He mentioned the same three goals as Rubio and said that Washington and Moscow agreed to appoint representatives to carry out “regular consultations” on Ukraine.  “We not only listened_ but also heard each other_” Lavrov. ”And I have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position_ which we have once again outlined in detail_ using specific examples_ based on President Putin’s repeated speeches.”  The meeting marked the most extensive contact between the two countries since Moscow’s Feb. 24_ 2022_ invasion. Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago_ but tensions remained high.  Concerns from allies they are being sidelined  The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Ukraine and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won’t be favorable to them.  Kyiv’s absence at Tuesday’s talks has rankled many Ukrainians_ and France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to discuss the war. Kyiv’s participation in such talks was a bedrock of U.S. policy under Biden_ whose administration also led international efforts to isolate Russia over the war.  Rubio said Tuesday that ending the conflict would require concessions from all sides and that Europe would be a part of talks.  In talking about sanctions against Russia_ Rubio noted that the measures have come from the U.S.‘s allies as well.  “The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed_” he said.  French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelenskyy following Monday’s European meeting.  “We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine_” Macron wrote on social media platform X. “To achieve this_ Russia must end its aggression_ and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians_” he said and vowed to “work on this together with all Europeans_ Americans_ and Ukrainians.”  Peskov on Tuesday said that Putin has repeatedly expressed readiness for peace talks_ and noted that a durable settlement of the conflict in Ukraine would be impossible without “a comprehensive consideration of security issues” in Europe.  Saudi Arabia’s role  The meeting at the Diriyah Palace in the Saudi capital of Riyadh also highlights de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to be a major diplomatic player_ burnishing a reputation severely tarnished by the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Saudi state media described the talks as happening at the prince’s direction. Like the neighboring United Arab Emirates_ the prince has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine_ both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically as well.  Saudi Arabia has also helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in 2023. Zelenskyy said he would travel to the kingdom later this week.  Rubio was accompanied by U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz and special envoy Steve Witkoff_ while Lavrov sat next to Ushakov. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and national security adviser Musaed al Alban joined Rubio_ Lavrov and others for the start of the meeting.  War continues  Meanwhile_ Russia continued to pummel Ukraine with drones_ according to Kyiv’s military. The Ukrainian air force said Russian troops launched a barrage of 176 drones at Ukraine overnight_ most of which were destroyed or disabled by jamming.  One Russian drone struck a residential building in Dolynska in the Kirovohrad region_ wounding a mother and her two children and prompting an evacuation of 38 apartments_ the regional administration reported. Four more residential buildings were damaged by drone debris in the Cherkasy region of Ukraine_ according to local officials.

291597674,A Delta Air Lines passenger jet made a dramatic crash landing at Toronto airport on Monday afternoon_ flipping upside down on the tarmac with its tail and one wing shorn off.  But all 80 people aboard clambered out of the jet_ which was coming in from Minneapolis. At least 18 of them suffered injuries_ some of them critical but not life threatening.  The authorities are investigating the cause of the accident_ which occurred amid strong winds and drifting snow.  It was the latest in a spate of incidents that have rattled travelers globally_ including a crash in South Korea in December that killed 179 people and a fatal midair collision near Washington that left 67 people dead.  Here is what to know about the crash in Toronto.  The plane’s roof became its floor.  Pete Koukov_ a professional skier from Colorado who was on Flight 4819_ said that nothing seemed amiss during the plane’s final descent.  “The second that the wheels hit the ground_ then everything happened_” Mr. Koukov_ 28_ said in an interview on Monday night. “The next thing I know_ we’re sideways.”
291941504,A Los Angeles jury acquitted A$AP Rocky of the firearm assault charges brought against him for his curbside altercation with former friend A$AP Relli that ended with the sound of gunfire crackling through the heart of Hollywood.   Rocky_ born Rakim Mayers_ stood in a tailored pinstriped suit_ looking calm with his hands in his pockets as jurors filed into the courtroom after only three and a half hours of deliberation in the closely watched case. Rihanna watched from the front row along with Rocky’s mother and sister_ Erika B.   As soon as the verdict to count one was read_ Rocky jumped over the gallery wall and fell into Rihanna’s lap_ hugging her. Many in the courtroom crowd erupted in applause.   The 36-year-old rapper was accused of brandishing a Glock 43 semiautomatic firearm and pointing it menacingly at Relli during an initial confrontation near a parking garage outside the W Hollywood hotel on Nov. 6_ 2021. During five days of testimony_ Relli_ born Terell Ephron_ told jurors Mayers returned the gun to his waistband but then pulled it out again and fired two shots at him a block away. Ephron said he immediately felt a hot sensation on his left hand and believed he was grazed by a 9 mm bullet.   Throughout the trial_ Mayers didn’t dispute he pulled the trigger. Instead_ he claimed through his lawyer that he was carrying a prop gun that he’d received from the set of the “D.M.B.” music video he shot with Rihanna in July 2021. Mayers claimed he fired two blanks as “warning shots” to stop Ephron’s alleged attack on A$AP Illz_ another member of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective_ the lawyer said.   The 13-day trial set up dramatically different narratives of what happened that night. In Ephron’s version_ adopted by prosecutors_ Mayers had insulted him during an overheard phone call the day before and was harboring “weird grudges” when he pulled up to the meeting with an entourage consisting of Illz_ born Illijah Ulanger_ and A$AP Twelvyy_ born Jamel Phillips. Ephron claimed Mayers blurted out_ “What’s up now_ pussy?” and made the first physical move by grabbing his collar. He testified that Mayers threatened to kill him but retreated when he saw pedestrians approaching.   Ephron admitted he followed Mayers around a corner_ taunting him. He said Mayers eventually turned and opened fire at the corner of Selma Ave. and Vista Del Mar Ave. but couldn’t get a clear shot because Ephron grabbed Ulanger and used him as a “human shield.” After receiving a 911 call_ police responded to the scene but never found any shell casings or signs of a shooting_ multiple LAPD officers testified. Ephron claimed he went back later that night and quickly found two 9 mm steel casings that he placed in a plastic bag and held for two days before handing them over to police.   In Mayers’ version_ it was Ephron who was the initial aggressor that night_ the one who stalked him around two street corners and couldn’t be trusted. Mayers didn’t testify in his own defense_ but his lawyer Joe Tacopina subjected Ephron to a bruising cross-examination that accused him of fabricating the shell casing evidence to try to extort his wealthy friend with a $30 million lawsuit. Calling Ephron an “angry pathological liar_” Tacopina accused Ephron of deleting four critical text messages before handing his phone over to police. The deleted texts_ sent to Mayers the morning of the incident_ called the rapper a “pussy” and dared him to start a physical fight. “I wish you would_” he texted_ adding_ “Give me a reason.” The lawyer argued Ephron “perjured” himself again when he claimed phone calls recorded by a mutual friend and handed over to Mayers were “fake_” created by artificial intelligence. In the calls_ Ephron said he hoped to extract millions from Mayers and then go hide from prosecutors on a tropical island. The mutual friend later authenticated the calls on the witness stand_ and prosecutors accepted they were real.    In one of the most dramatic twists of the trial_ Tacopina confronted Ephron with video seized from his phone that showed him shooting a semiautomatic pistol at a gun range on Oct. 19_ 2021 – just two weeks before the incident in Hollywood. Ephron had just testified that he’d never fired a 9 mm semiautomatic before that night_ not even at a gun range. In the video_ spent shell casings were seen visibly ejecting over his shoulder. After seeing the video_ Ephron told jurors the gun range was definitely not in Los Angeles. Three days later_ he returned to the witness stand and said he did some “homework” and determined the range was actually the Los Angeles Gun Club. Tacopina argued that Ephron was forced into the about-face because a Twitter user posted an interior photo of the Los Angeles Gun Club that appeared “identical” to the Ephron video.   In his closing argument_ Tacopina said Ephron “blatantly lied” about his access to spent 9 mm shell casings before the incident_ calling his testimony “a perjury mini-series.” “Remember how that all played out here when considering his credibility_” Tacopina said. “There’d be no reason to lie about that unless he had to cover up something.” (Ephron told jurors he did not concoct any evidence in the case.)   No fingerprints were found on the shell casings handed over by Ephron and no firearm was ever recovered. Surveillance video clips showing the initial scuffle at the garage and the alleged shooting a block away were played over and over for jurors. The shooting video was recorded with no sound_ but prosecutors synchronized it with the sound of two loud pops recorded from a different camera around the corner. Mayers’ lawyers used the same methodology to come up with their own synchronization. In the prosecution’s version_ the first pop comes just before Ephron tangles with Ulanger. In the defense version_ the first pop comes after Ephron is seen in contact with Ulanger_ supporting the defense claim Mayers fired to defend Ulanger. The judge allowed both videos to be admitted_ leaving jurors with the task of determining which made more sense.   Mayers’ star defense witness was A$AP Twelvyy. He told jurors Ephron was the aggressor from the start and that he believed the prop gun only came out at the parking garage because Mayers’ pants started to fall during the initial tussle_ leading Mayers to grab it with his non-dominant left hand. He claimed both he and Ephron knew the gun was a prop and that Ephron even blurted at one point_ “Shoot that fake-ass gun.” (In his prior testimony_ Ephron denied calling the gun fake. He did recall daring Mayers to fire_ allegedly saying “If you brought a gun_ use it then.”)   To further corroborate his prop gun defense_ Mayers called Lou Levin_ a tour manager also known as A$AP Lou. Levin told jurors that Mayers got the prop gun from the set of the “D.M.B.” music video he filmed with Rihanna in July 2021 and had it with him the day of the run-in with Ephron because he carried it as a deterrent to violence. Levin said he personally returned the prop gun to the video’s co-director after the incident. “The decision was made because_ like I said_ [Rocky] carried it to deter violence_ and on Nov. 6_ it obviously didn’t work. And he decided to just get actual armed security_ and he didn’t want to carry it anymore_” Levin testified. “I flew back to New York with it and gave it to the co-director we got it from.”   The high-profile trial was marked by strife between Tacopina – a pit bull lawyer famed for representing celebrity clients including Meek Mill_ YG and President Trump – and Deputy District Attorney John Lewin_ known for prosecuting Robert Durst. The sniping got to so heated one afternoon_ after jurors left_ that Judge Arnold yelled “Stop it!” as Mayers stepped in between the men to signal it was time to walk away.   The proceeding also made headlines for Rihanna’s appearances in the courtroom. The superstar singer_ who shares two young sons with Mayers_ attended seven days of trial sitting in a front row seat. One afternoon_ she appeared late in the day and greeted Mayers with a long hug in a vestibule just outside the courtroom. On Thursday_ she walked in with the couple’s two toddler sons while the prosecution was starting its summation. During a morning break_ Mayers walked down the hall holding the younger boy upside down. On Valentines Day_ Rihanna sat with Mayers during another break_ gently caressing his cheek while the couple sat on a courtroom bench_ surrounded by beefy security guards.   Mayer’s mother_ Renee Black_ attended each day of the trial to support her son. She famously named her son after one one-half of the famed New York hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim and raised him in Harlem. Mayers became one of the original A$AP Mob members and released his first breakthrough singles_ “Purple Swag” and “Peso_” in 2011. He achieved mainstream success two years later when his first studio album_ At. Long. Last. A$AP_ hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200.   Beyond music_ Mayers also is known for his substantial influence in the world of men’s fashion. He’s been the face of campaigns for Gucci_ Bottega Veneta and Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty line. He emerged from his chauffeur-driven SUV each morning looking like he just walked off the pages of a glossy magazine. There was a Chanel trapper hat_ a Celine leather bomber jacket and a Saint Laurent trench coat that got a mention in a New York Times story about Mayers’ trial style.   The trial was no doubt a stark change of scenery for the musical artist who’s been living with his billionaire partner_ traveling the world and setting up the next stage of his career. As the proceeding opened_ Mayers was set to headline the Los Angeles Rolling Loud California festival scheduled for March. He also was tapped to serve as co-chair of the next Met Gala alongside Pharrell Williams and LeBron James in May. Meanwhile_ music fans are awaiting the imminent release of his fourth studio album_ Don’t Be Dumb.   And Mayers is due to make his mainstream acting debut as one of the main characters in Spike Lee’s upcoming reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 kidnapping drama High and Low. The new film_ titled Highest 2 Lowest_ was shot last year in New York with co-stars Denzel Washington and fellow rapper Ice Spice. On a courthouse elevator early in the trial_ Mayers asked a camera operator covering his case about his equipment_ whether it was similar to a camera used by Lee. He seemed eager to talk shop_ eager to change the subject to anything creative.
292045204,You just never know where things are going to go with US president Donald Trump.  When he started talking about Ukraine last night_ at first_ he appeared to give his approval to the idea of deploying European peacekeeping forces there (“all for” and “fine”) and said he had no plans for pulling out US troops from Europe_ despite some suggestions that Russia’s Putin would ask him to do that. So far_ so good.  But the longer his statement continued_ the worse it became for Ukraine.  Trump eventually said that Zelenskyy “should have never started it_ ... could have made a deal_” as if it was Ukraine who invaded Russia and not the other way round_ and repeated Russian key demands for elections in Ukraine_ with unfounded allegations on president Zelenskyy’s poor approval rating.  This will ring alarm bells in Ukraine and across Europe again.  The US president also said last night that he was “much more confident” of a deal after the talks_ adding “they were very good_” and that Russia “want to stop the savage barbarism.”  (Whisper it_ but they can do it quite easily_ being the ones who invaded.)  As Sean Savett_ who was the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council under then-president Joe Biden_ said more bluntly in a social media post: “Sounds like Trump bought Putin’s propaganda hook_ line_ and sinker.  On Tuesday_ US state secretary Marco Rubio debriefed the Quint – France_ Germany_ Italy and the UK – and the European Union on the talks_ promising they will stay “in close contact as we work to achieve a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine.”  But EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas issued a pointed warning: “Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps.”  One issue that was discussed during last night’s talks was a proposed moratorium on attacks on the energy infrastructure of Russia and Ukraine. It was rejected by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov_ who insisted at his press conference that the Russians would never do that anyway as they only attack legitimate military targets.  You will be shocked – shocked! – to hear that Ukraine reported overnight a Russian attack on energy infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa_ leaving at least 160_000 residents without heating and power. It is -7 degrees Celsius there.  More European allies are expected to meet in Paris today after protests over their exclusion from the hand-picked group invited for Monday’s first round of talks. The invitees reportedly include Norway_ Canada_ the Baltic states_ the Czech Republic_ Greece_ Finland_ Romania_ Sweden and Belgium. We are yet to formally hear about it from the Élysée Palace.  No doubt there will be more consultations taking place behind the scenes_ and US Ukraine envoy Keith Kellog will be in Kyiv today.  I will bring you the latest.  It’s Wednesday_ 19 February 2025_ and this is Europe live. It’s Jakub Krupa here.  Good morning.
292254286,Feb. 19 (UPI) -- A plane crash at an Arizona airport outside of Tucson left at least one dead Wednesday morning with details still sketchy.  The Marana Police Department said on social media that information remained limited at the Marana Regional Airport_ which described the incident as an "aircraft collision." The department said the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have been called to investigate.  Authorities said that two planes were involved_ and both were occupied at the time of the accident.  Details about the accident_ the airplanes involved_ and the individuals involved have not been released.  The Marana Regional Airport_ also known as the Marana Northwest Regional Airport_ is a small general aviation airport about 13 miles from Tucson. The city of Marana has owned the facility for more than two decades after purchasing it from Pima County.  According to information from the city_ the airport is home to about 260 aircraft. The airport had more than 90_000 take-offs and landings in 2014 and caters to small aircraft_ with its longest runway extending 6_901 feet.
291955216,By FATIMA HUSSEIN_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.  Over the past few days_ President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100_ 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits — a “HUGE problem_” Musk wrote_ as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste_ fraud and abuse.  It is true that improper payments have been made_ including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.  Here are the facts:  What has the Trump administration said about payments to centenarians?  On Tuesday_ Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that “we have millions and millions of people over 100 years old” receiving Social Security benefits. “They’re obviously fraudulent or incompetent_” Trump said.  “If you take all of those millions of people off Social Security_ all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90_ but not 200 years old_” he said. He also said that there’s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.  Late Monday_ Musk posted a slew of posts on his social media platform X_ including: “Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security_” and “Having tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as “ALIVE” when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second …”  How big of a problem is Social Security fraud?  A July 2024 report from Social Security’s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022_ the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits_ including $71.8 billion — or less than 1% — in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.  In addition_ in early January_ the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments— not just Social Security payments— that improperly went to dead people_ a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was “just the tip of the iceberg.”  The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration’s “Full Death Master File” for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died_ and the file contains more than 142 million records_ which go back to 1899_ according to the Treasury.  Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period_ which runs from December 2023 through 2026.  So are tens of millions of people over 100 years old receiving benefits?  Part of the confusion comes from Social Security’s software system based on the COBOL programming language_ which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.  Additionally_ a series of reports from the Social Security Administration’s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database_ which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean_ however_ that these individuals were receiving benefits.  The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so_ which would run upward of $9 million.  A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that “almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.” And_ as of September 2015_ the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.  What are some of the concerns about misinformation on Social Security payments?  Chuck Blahous_ a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University_ said_ “Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.”  But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high_ “Social Security would be near the bottom of the list_ not near the top_” Blahous said. “Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial_ and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.”  “By all means — go after any improper payments that are found_ but let’s not pretend that’s where the system’s biggest financial problems are_” he said.  Sita Nataraj Slavov_ a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University_ said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government’s financial problems are simpler than they appear.  “The real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there’s an easy fix to Social Security’s financial problems — that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits_” Slavov said. “This is simply not true.”  What does the White House say about the criticism?  Karoline Leavitt_ the White House spokesperson_ referred back to the Social Security’s inspector general report.  “A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments_” she said. “The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste_ fraud_ and abuse in the Administration’s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.”

291934282,Howard Lutnick_ President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Commerce_ has been confirmed by the Senate in a 51–45 vote.  Prior to the upper chamber vote_ Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) touted Lutnick’s success on Wall Street and his work with Sept. 11 survivors.  “I am glad President Trump has chosen an outcome-driven leader_” Thune said in prepared remarks.  “Howard Lutnick’s greatest business achievement is not building his own success or building up a company; it was rebuilding Cantor Fitzgerald.” The headquarters of the financial services firm was in the North Tower of the World Trade Center_ just above the impact site of one of the Sept. 11_ 2001_ terrorist attacks. All of its 658 employees in the office that day died.  Thune called Lutnick’s story inspiring as he gave surviving staff an option: either attend 20 funerals a day for the next month or work hard to rebuild the firm. Employees agreed to donate a quarter of their salaries to the 658 families of their colleagues with no limit and no expectations to be repaid.  “It’s a lesson in resilience_ determination in the American spirit_ and it demonstrates the type of person Howard Lutnick is_ and the type of public servant that he'll be_” Thune said.  Lutnick passed a crucial procedural vote in the upper chamber on Feb. 13 as senators advanced his nomination in a 52-45 vote.  A week earlier_ the Senate Commerce_ Science_ and Transportation Committee voted 16-12 to send the billionaire CEO to the procedural vote. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) voted with all Republicans in support of Lutnick.  “They treat us poorly_” Lutnick told lawmakers of U.S. trading partners. “We are treated horribly by the global trading environment. They all have higher tariffs_ non-tariff trade barriers_ and subsidies.”  Lutnick_ chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald_ advocated for across-the-board tariffs instead of targeted levies. He believes a targeted approach would result in “picking on farmers.”  “I think when you pick one product in Mexico_ they’ll pick one product [to retaliate]_” he said. “We pick avocados_ they pick white corn; we pick tomatoes_ they pick yellow corn.”  This comes as Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on foreign nations_ a strategy that could go into effect as early as April.  “I have decided_ for purposes of fairness_ that I will charge a reciprocal tariff being whatever countries charge the United States of America_” Trump said from the Oval Office on Feb. 13.  “We will charge them no more_ no less. In other words_ they charge us a tax or tariff_ and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff. Very simple.”  A key component of the latest tariff plans will be focusing on the European Union’s value-added tax (VAT)_ which administration officials liken to a tariff.  VATs are consumption taxes levied on the value added to goods and services_ and are collected at each stage of production and distribution. While the standard VAT rate must be at least 15 percent_ the average EU rate is 21.8 percent.  Lutnick criticized the VAT because “when they sell to us_ of course_ they drop that 20 percent right away.”  “So_ it’s sort of an export subsidy_ if you will_” he said. “We are going to address each country one by one.”  Lutnick is expected to lead studies to determine the appropriate tariff rates for each nation. He told reporters he anticipates the studies will be finished by April 1.

The fast-talking_ energetic_ disgraced executive was convicted of wire fraud and securities fraud in 2022 for misleading investors about Nikola's operations and zero-emissions technology.

Nikola's core products are all-electric and fuel cell electric semitrucks_ which it began producing in 2022. As of the third quarter of last year_ the company had only produced 600 of the vehicles since then.

Nikola warned investors on its third-quarter conference call that the company only had enough cash to support its business into the first quarter of 2025 but not beyond.

292603024,LOUISVILLE_ Ky. -- Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday that he won't seek reelection next year_ ending a decadeslong tenure as a power broker who championed conservative causes but ultimately ceded ground to the fierce GOP populism of President Donald Trump.  McConnell_ the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history_ chose his 83rd birthday to share his decision not to run for another term in Kentucky and to retire when his current term ends. He informed The Associated Press of his decision before he addressed colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor.  "Seven times_ my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate_" McConnell said_ as aides lined the back chamber and several senators listened from seats. "Every day in between I've been humbled by the trust they've placed in me to do their business here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last."  His announcement begins the epilogue of a storied career as a master strategist_ one in which he helped forge a conservative Supreme Court and steered the Senate through tax cuts_ presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights.  McConnell_ first elected in 1984_ intends to serve the remainder of his term ending in January 2027. The Kentuckian has dealt with a series of medical episodes in recent years_ including injuries sustained from falls and times when his face briefly froze while he was speaking.  The senator delivered his speech in a chamber the famously taciturn McConnell revered as a young intern long before joining its back benches as a freshman lawmaker in the mid-1980s. His dramatic announcement comes almost a year after his decision to relinquish his leadership post after the November 2024 election. South Dakota Sen. John Thune_ a top McConnell deputy_ replaced him as majority leader.  McConnell's looming departure reflects the changing dynamics of the Trump-led GOP. He's seen his power diminish on a parallel track with both his health and his relationship with Trump_ who once praised him as an ally but has taken to criticizing him in caustic terms.  In Kentucky_ McConnell's departure will mark the loss of a powerful advocate and will set off a competitive GOP primary next year for what will now be an open Senate seat. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear_ seen as a rising star in his party for winning statewide office in Republican territory_ has said he has no interest in the Senate_ though he is widely viewed as a contender for higher office.  McConnell_ a diehard adherent to Ronald Reagan's brand of traditional conservatism and muscular foreign policy_ increasingly found himself out of step with a GOP shifting toward the fiery_ often isolationist populism espoused by Trump.  McConnell still champions providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid to fend off Russia's invasion_ even as Trump ratchets up criticism of the country and its leader_ Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The senator plans to make it clear Thursday that national defense remains at the forefront of his agenda.  "Thanks to Ronald Reagan's determination_ the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate_" McConnell said in his prepared remarks. "But since then_ we've allowed that power to atrophy. And today_ a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So_ lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to."  McConnell and Trump were partners during Trump's first term_ but the relationship was severed after McConnell blamed Trump for "disgraceful" acts in the Jan. 6_ 2021_ Capitol attack by his supporters. A momentary thaw in 2024 when McConnell endorsed Trump didn't last.  Last week_ Trump referred to McConnell as a "very bitter guy" after McConnell_ who battled polio as a child_ opposed vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation as the nation's top health official. McConnell referred to Trump as a "despicable human being" and a "narcissist" in a biography of the senator by The Associated Press' deputy Washington bureau chief_ Michael Tackett.  Before their falling out_ Trump and McConnell pushed through a tax overhaul largely focused on reductions for businesses and higher-earning taxpayers. They joined forces to reshape the Supreme Court when Trump nominated three justices and McConnell guided them to Senate confirmation_ tilting the high court to the right.  McConnell set a new precedent for hardball partisan tactics in 2016 by refusing to even give a hearing to Democratic President Barack Obama's pick of Merrick Garland to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Putting the brakes on the Senate's "advise and consent" role for judicial nominees_ McConnell said the vacancy should be filled by the next president so voters could have their say. Trump filled the vacancy once he took office_ and McConnell later called the stonewalling of Garland's nomination his "most consequential" achievement.  Later_ when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died weeks before the 2020 presidential election won by Democrat Joe Biden_ McConnell rushed Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation through the Senate_ waving off allegations of hypocrisy.  McConnell also guided the Senate - and Trump - through two impeachment trials that ended in acquittals.  In the second impeachment_ weeks after the deadly Capitol attack by a mob hoping to overturn Trump's 2020 reelection defeat_ McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting to acquit. McConnell said he believed Trump couldn't be convicted because he'd already left office_ but the senator also condemned Trump as "practically and morally responsible" for the insurrection.  McConnell over the years swung back and forth from majority to minority leader_ depending on which party held power. He defended President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq war and failed to block Obama's health care overhaul.  McConnell_ the longest-serving senator ever from Kentucky_ ensured that the Bluegrass State received plenty of federal funding. Back home he was a key architect in his party's rise to power in a state long dominated by Democrats.  He is married to Elaine Chao_ and they have long been a power couple in Washington. In his prepared remarks Thursday_ the senator referred to her as his "ultimate teammate and confidante." Chao was labor secretary for Bush and transportation secretary during Trump's first term_ though she resigned after the Capitol insurrection_ saying it had "deeply troubled" her.  McConnell's parting words reflected his devotion to the Senate and his disdain for his detractors.  "The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence_" he said. "And_ to the disappointment of my critics_ I'm still here on the job."  Schreiner reported from Louisville_ Ky.

This season_ Wembanyama is averaging 24.3 points_ 11.0 rebounds_ 3.8 blocks and 3.7 assists while carrying an elite 59.4 true shooting percentage.  The 7’3" French product has already given San Antonio enough long-term security to make an aggressive trade earlier this season acquiring point guard De’Aaron Fox to become his long-term running mate. With Wembanyama and Fox together in San Antonio_ they expect to compete for championships for years to come in the loaded Western Conference.  In the meantime_ San Antonio will rely heavily on Fox and the rest of their talented young core to stay in the postseason race.

292347598,A U.S. appeals court has declined the Trump administration's request to overturn a hold on its plans to end birthright citizenship for some people born in the U.S.President Donald Trump signed an executive order on the day he was inaugurated that would revoke U.S. citizenship for some children born in the U.S. starting on February 19. The executive order triggered multiple lawsuits on constitutional grounds.The latest court order is a response to an emergency request from the Department of Justice that sought to clear the way forward to act on the executive order. The continued freeze sets up a likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.RELATED STORY | Federal judge bars enforcement of Trump’s birthright citizenship executive orderIn the new order_ Judge M. Smith Canby wrote "the Government has not shown that it is entitled to immediate relief. Its sole basis for seeking emergency action from this court is that “[t]he district court has . . . stymied the implementation of an Executive Branch policy . . . nationwide for almost three weeks.” That alone is insufficient. It is routine for both executive and legislative policies to be challenged in court_ particularly where a new policy is a significant shift from prior understanding and practice."The Trump administration has not yet commented on the order.This is a developing story and will be updated.

Connor McDavid scored the game-winning goal to give his country the ultimate bragging rights in this Everyone wondered what would happen at the opening puck drop following the three fights in nine seconds that occurred this past Saturday in Montreal between these two countries. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM But it was a normal start to a hockey game_ as gloves stayed on sticks and both teams got down to business. However_ there was something similar to the last game_ as it was Team Canada getting on the board first thanks to Nathan MacKinnon’s nifty wrister nearly five minutes into the period.

Thomas Harley and Sam Reinhart received assists on the goal. But Team USA responded on Saturday with three unanswered goals after going down 1-0_ and they went to start that trend again.

With three Team Canada players around their crease_ Tkachuk fought through them all and managed to get just enough stick on the puck to put it past Canada goalie Jordan Binnington to tie the game. In the second period_ Tkachuk’s forecheck was fantastic behind the net as he ultimately set up a goal by 22-year-old Jake Sanderson_ the Montana native who buried a wrister on another assist from Matthews as well as defenseman Zach Werenski. Again_ it appeared the game script was being written again_ but Sam Bennett had other things in mind for Team Canada. With six minutes to play in the second_ Bennett tied it up on a perfectly placed wrister over the shoulder of Hellybuyck that was set up by Mitch Marner_ who got USA defenseman Adam Fox to chase him to the middle of the ice before slipping the puck to an open Bennett. With the game tied at two goals apiece_ the second period horn sounded_ and this 4 Nations championship tilt was set up for a rowdy third period – the type of hockey everyone wanted to see between these two world powerhouses in Boston.

292840624,The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York City and leading authorities on a five-day manhunt is scheduled to be in court Friday for the first time since his December arraignment on state murder and terror charges.  Luigi Mangione_ 26_ is set for a hearing in state court in Manhattan.  Prosecutors and Mangione’s defense lawyers are expected to provide updates on the status of the case and Judge Gregory Carro could set deadlines for pretrial paperwork and possibly even a trial date.  Mangione has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder_ including murder as an act of terrorism_ in the Dec. 4 killing of Brian Thompson outside a midtown Manhattan hotel.  The executive was ambushed and shot on a sidewalk as he walked to an investor conference.  Mangione also faces federal charges that could carry the possibility of the death penalty.  He is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants_ including Sean “Diddy” Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried.  Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks_ with the state charges expected to go to trial first.  The maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole.  A Feb. 24 hearing in Pennsylvania on charges of possessing an unlicensed firearm_ forgery and providing false identification to police was canceled.  In a statement posted on a website for his legal defense_ Mangione said: “I am overwhelmed by — and grateful for — everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully_ this support has transcended political_ racial_ and even class divisions.”  Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald’s on Dec. 9.  Police said he was carrying a gun that matched the one used in the shooting and a fake ID.  He also was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives_ authorities said.  Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo argued at his Dec. 23 arraignment that “warring jurisdictions” had turned Mangione into a “human ping-pong ball.”  She accused New York City Mayor Eric Adams and other government officials of tainting the jury pool by bringing Mangione back to Manhattan in a choreographed spectacle involving heavily armed officers escorting him up a pier from a heliport.  Friedman Agnifilo singled out Adams’ comment on a local TV station that he wanted to be there to look “him in the eye and say_ ‘you carried out this terroristic act in my city.’”
292934372,Jerry Butler’s baritone combined the soaring ecstasy of church_ the rumbling rhythms of Chicago and the soul of his native Sunflower_ Mississippi. Warm and plush but also cool_ it won him the nickname “Iceman.”  The songs of the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer became a soundtrack for the 1950s and 1960s. He achieved fame as a member of The Impressions and later as a solo soul artist. His songs have been sampled by others including Missy Elliott_ Snoop Dogg_ Method Man and The Game.  The Bronzeville resident went on to a 32-year political career as a member of the Cook County Board_ helped by backing from Mayor Harold Washington.  Mr. Butler_ whose voice was stilled by Parkinson’s disease_ died Thursday night at home_ according to a family friend.  In 1942_ when he was 3 years old_ his sharecropper parents left Mississippi for Chicago.  “We were so poor when I was growing up that my mother would boil chicken feet in water_ add a little salt_ and that was our meal_” he wrote in his autobiography_ which took its title from his late 1960s hit_ “Only the Strong Survive (Memoirs of a Soul Survivor).”  The Butlers moved into the Cabrini-Green public housing complex at 1117 N. Cleveland Ave. He attended James A. Sexton elementary school_ where his teacher Ernestine B. Curry taught her students about Black leaders like Mary McCleod Bethune_ W.E.B. DuBois_ Duke Ellington and Nat Turner.  “Mrs. Curry gave us a sense of pride and dignity that has carried me and many of her students through life_” Mr. Butler wrote.  His father Jerry Butler Sr. got a job with the city of Chicago’s Department of Streets and Sanitation.  His religious mother Arvelia Agnew Butler used to call the radio stations that played the blues “devil stations.”  But young Jerry was allowed to watch TV’s “Hit Parade.”  He learned how to write songs by reading “Hit Parade” magazine_ which “printed out the sheet music of the hits performed on the show_” he wrote. “It helped us learn how not only to sight read but how to structure songs.”  In 1953_ 13-year-old Jerry visited the Traveling Souls Spiritualist Church of Rev. Annabelle Mayfield. He joined her gospel group_ the Northern Jubilee Singers_ and met her grandson_ someone he wrote had “a great tenor voice.” That was Curtis Mayfield.  Before they climbed the music charts as The Impressions_young Jerry attended Washburne Trade School_ studying to be a chef — which made him popular on the road.  “Jerry could cook like somebody’s mama_” Smokey Robinson said in Mr. Butler’s book.  He didn’t like high school music class. Mr. Butler wrote that he and other Black students chafed at singing “old racist standards like ‘Old Black Joe_’ ‘Swanee River’ and ‘My Old Kentucky Home.’ ”  Still_ according to Mr. Butler_ “Music period wasn’t a total loss. We would go in the boys room and sing all the latest doo-wops and listen to our voices bounce off the tile and porcelain.”  He and Mayfield went on to form The Impressions_ with Mr. Butler as lead singer_ according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame_ where the group was inducted in 1991. Mr. Butler said their manager suggested the group’s name because they left a good impression.  They performed in gray silk jackets they bought at the old Maxwell Street market.  Their first hit was 1958’s “For Your Precious Love.” Rolling Stone said it was based on a poem Butler wrote in high school. In 2003_ the magazine ranked the song No. 335 on its “500 Greatest Songs of All Time.”  “The Impressions traversed the sounds of the Fifties and Sixties as well as old and new social attitudes_” according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. “Their music was the sound of the Civil Rights Movement.”  Jerry and Annette Butler’s wedding in 1959 included singer Chuck Barksdale of the Dells and the Moonglows_ Moonglows singer and future record executive Harvey Fuqua and Wade Flemons_ an early singer-pianist with Earth Wind & Fire_ in the wedding party.  After “For Your Precious Love_” Mr. Butler decided to go solo. But soon he found “My career wasn’t going anywhere_” he said in his book. He and Mayfield reunited to craft Mr. Butler’s 1960 Vee-Jay hit “He Will Break Your Heart.”   Mayfield matured into the musical genius who created the soundtrack for the 1972 film “Superfly_” pulsating with slinky soul and ferocious funk. He wrote hits like “It’s All Right” and civil rights anthems including “People Get Ready.”  Mr. Butler went on to work with legendary songwriter-producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff_ creators of what became known as the Philly sounds. Their hits included “Never [Gonna] Give You Up_”“Hey Western Union Man” and “Only the Strong Survive_” which Mr. Butler said grew out of his mother’s words of wisdom when his high school romance ended.   He said his biggest money came from “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long_” which he composed with Otis Redding. It’s been covered by Joe Cocker_ Aretha Franklin_ Jason Isbell_ Etta James_ Cat Power_ the Rolling Stones and Tina Turner.  “I receive more royalties from Otis’ one recording of that song than I get from everything I ever recorded_” he wrote.  In 1961_ before it became a theme song for singer and TV variety-show host Andy Williams_ Mr. Butler recorded “Moon River.”   He toured with Tammi Terrell and recorded for Motown with Thelma Houston. Over the years_ his background singers included Nick Ashford_ Patti Austin_ Nona Hendryx_ Cissy Houston_ Patti LaBelle_ Melba Moore and Valerie Simpson.  Mr. Butler’s velvet voice could smoothly shift to a sensual growl or catch-in-the-throat throb. He credited singers Sam Cooke and Archie Brownlee as influences. His nickname came from his cool style.  “It started with a disk jockey in Philadelphia as a joke_” he said. “I came through a period when the Isley Brothers were jumping off the stage_ and James Brown was sliding across the floor. But I am just a standup singer. Because of that_ it started out that I was ‘cool.’ then ‘ice_’ then ‘the Iceman.’  Mr. Butler sang on the soundtrack to the 1970 Peter Boyle film “Joe.” He had a line as a prison guard in the schlocky 1972 movie “The Thing with Two Heads.” As Rosey Grier is about to be executed in the electric chair — and have Ray Milland’s head attached to his body — Mr. Butler says to the football great: “More power to you_ brother.”  And he starred in a 1980s McDonald’s commercial for a new sandwich_ the McD.L.T. The Iceman crooned about the cool lettuce and tomato_ while “sizzlin’ ” Aretha Franklin sang about the hot burger.EIn his later years_ Mr. Butler fought in court for artist royalties and benefits_ and with his brother_ singer Billy Butler_ created a workshop for fledgling songwriters.  Method Man sampled Mr. Butler’s song “I’m Your Mechanical Man” in “Bring The Pain_” and Missy Elliott did the same in her song by the same name. The Game sampled “No Money Down_” and Snoop Dogg sampled “I Need You” in “Think About It.”  Mr. Butler’s wife died in 2019. Survivors include their sons Anthony and Randy_ four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

If you don’t want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can do that we can move forward on solving this. This is urgent_ Elon.”   “I’m not giving any details but he won’t respond to texts call or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer life long impairment if he doesn’t respond asap_ so I need him to f–king respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that’s where we are at_” she continued.  The exes share sons X Æ A-Xii_ 4_ and Techno Mechanicus_ 2_ and daughter Exa Dark Sideræl_ 3.  Reps for Musk_ 53_ and Grimes_ 36_ weren’t immediately available to Page Six for comment.  Last week_ Grimes was also forced to call out Musk via X for bringing their son X Æ A-XII with him to meet with President Trump at the Oval Office in Washington D.C.  The toddler was photographed sitting on the tech billionaire’s shoulders as Trump signed an executive order to give Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency additional power.  The photos of X Æ A-XII with Musk caused Grimes to worry about their son’s privacy_ as she wrote on social media_ “He should not be in public like this.”   The “Oblivion” singer also thanked fans for bringing the photos to her awareness_ adding_ “I did not see this_ thank u for alerting me.”   The pop star and the Tesla founder were involved in an on and off relationship from 2018 to 2022.  Musk is also the father to his late son_ Nevada Alexander_ Griffin_ Vivian_ Kai_ Saxon_ Damian_ Strider_ Azure and two unknown children born in 2024.  On Feb. 14_ author Ashley St. Clair took to X to allege that she birthed Musk’s 13th child last year.  “Five months ago_ I welcomed a new baby into the world. Elon Musk is the father_” she wrote. “I have not previously disclosed this to protect our child’s privacy and safety_ but in recent days it has become clear that tabloid media intends to do so_ regardless of the harm it will cause.”   St. Clair explained that she wants their alleged child to “grow in a normal and safe environment” outside of the spotlight.  The SpaceX founder_ however_ has not yet confirmed St. Clair’s claim and the identity of his youngest child.
293030642,A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of attempted murder for stabbing author Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage in 2022.  A jury also found Hadi Matar_ 27_ of Fairview_ guilty of assault for wounding a man who was on stage with Rushdie at the time. The verdicts were delivered after less than two hours of deliberations following a trial in Chautauqua County Court.  Matar ran onto the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where Rushdie was about to speak on Aug. 12_ 2022_ and stabbed him more than a dozen times before a live audience. The attack left the 77-year-old prizewinning novelist blind in one eye.  Rushdie was the key witness during seven days of testimony_ describing in graphic detail his life-threatening injuries and long and painful recovery.  The judge set sentencing for April 23. Matar could receive up to 25 years in prison.  District Attorney Jason Schmidt played a slow-motion video of the attack for the jury Friday during his closing argument_ pointing out the assailant as he emerged from the audience_ walked up a staircase to the stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie.  “I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack_” Schmidt said. “I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.”  Assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that prosecutors have not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. The distinction is important for an attempted-murder conviction.  “You will agree something bad happened to Mr. Rushdie_ but you don’t know what Mr. Matar’s conscious objective was_” Brautigan said. “The testimony you have heard doesn’t establish anything more than a chaotic noisy outburst that occurred that injured Mr. Rushdie.”  Matar had with him knives_ not a gun or bomb_ his attorneys have said previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were life-threatening_ they have noted that Rushdie’s heart and lungs were uninjured.  Schmidt said while it’s not possible to read Matar’s mind_ “it’s foreseeable that if you’re going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck_ it’s going to result in a fatality.”  Rushdie_ the Booker Prize-winning author_ told jurors he thought he was dying when a masked stranger ran onto the stage and stabbed and slashed at him until being tackled by bystanders. Rushdie showed jurors his now-blinded right eye_ usually hidden behind a darkened eyeglass lens.  Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon_ who said Rushdie’s injuries would have been fatal without quick treatment.  He also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. Rushdie raises his arms and rises from his seat_ walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on_ swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.  Rushdie is seen flailing on the ground_ waving a hand covered in bright red blood. Schmidt freezes on a frame showing Rushdie_ his face also bloodied_ as he’s surrounded by people.  “We’ve shown you intent_” Schmidt said.  The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members who had been seated to hear Rushdie speak with City of Asylum Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese suffered a gash to his forehead_ leading to the assault charge against Matar.  From the witness stand_ institution staff and others who were present on the day of the attack pointed to Matar as the assailant.  Stabbed and slashed more than a dozen times in the head_ throat_ torso_ thigh and hand_ Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. He detailed his long and painful recovery in his 2024 memoir_ “Knife.”  Throughout the trial_ Matar often took notes with a pen and sometimes laughed or smiled with his defense team during breaks in testimony. His lawyers declined to call any witnesses of their own and Matar did not testify in his defense.  Public Defender Nathaniel Barone said Matar likely would have faced a lesser charge of assault were it not for Rushdie’s celebrity.  “We think that it became an attempted murder because of the notoriety of the alleged victim in the case_” Barone told reporters after testimony concluded Thursday. “That’s been it from the very beginning. It’s been nothing more_ nothing less. And it’s for publicity purposes. It’s for self-interest purposes.”  A separate federal indictment alleges that Matar was motivated to attack Rushdie by a 2006 speech in which the leader of the militant group Hezbollah endorsed a decades-old fatwa_ or edict_ calling for Rushdie’s death. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel “The Satanic Verses_” which some Muslims consider blasphemous.  Rushdie spent years in hiding. But after Iran announced that it would not enforce the decree_ he had traveled freely over the past quarter century.  A trial on the federal terrorism-related charges will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.
292731546,The Grammy-nominated singer who performed “O Canada” ahead of the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game deliberately changed the lyrics to the Canadian national anthem as a direct shot at President Donald Trump’s previous statements toward America’s northern neighbor.   A representative for Chantal Kreviazuk confirmed to CBC that the singer had purposefully changed the lyrics “in all of us command” to “that only us command.”  The rep also indicated that it was a response to the growing political tension between the United States and Canada and_ in particular_ Trump’s continuing quips that the U.S. would make Canada the 51st state.  Kreviazuk posted several images on her Instagram story before she went out to perform_ including a video of herself in her dressing room where she called singing the anthem_ “what an honor.”  Another post on her Instagram was a photo of the changed lyrics written on her hand.  Booing of the national anthems of the United States and Canada has become a large narrative during the mid-season tournament that was intended the juices flowing for the NHL’s return to the Winter Olympics in 2026.   A more political narrative has taken shape as the tournament has progressed.  Canadian hockey fans began booing the American national anthem at Bell Centre in Montreal when Team USA played there on Saturday.   When the 4 Nations Face-Off moved to Boston_ American fans returned the favor by booing the Canadian anthem  It was booed when Kreviazuk performed on Thursday night at TD Garden.   The animosity stems from threats of increased tariffs on Canada by Trump.   While Trump did not attend the championship game on Thursday_ he did call the American team earlier in the day and in a post on Truth Social_ the president said he would be cheering them on from afar.   The social media post also came with continued digs at Canada and the country’s prime minister Justin Trudeau.   “I’ll be calling our GREAT American Hockey Team this morning to spur them on towards victory tonight against Canada_ which with FAR LOWER TAXES AND MUCH STRONGER SECURITY_ will someday_ maybe soon_ become our cherished_ and very important_ Fifty First State_” Trump posted.   “I will be speaking before the Governors tonight in D.C._ and will sadly_ therefore_ be unable to attend. But we will all be watching_ and if Governor Trudeau would like to join us_ he would be most welcome. Good luck to everybody_ and have a GREAT game tonight. So exciting!”
293049362,WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio was arrested Friday near the U.S. Capitol on a charge that he assaulted a woman protesting a gathering attended by Tarrio and others who received presidential pardons for crimes stemming from the Jan. 6_ 2021_ riot in the nation’s capital.  Capitol police said officers saw Tarrio strike the protester’s cellphone and arm after the woman placed the phone close to his face as they walked near the Capitol. Tarrio had just left a news conference that had ended “without incident_” police said.  “The woman told our officers that she wanted to be a complainant_ and the man was arrested for the simple assault_” police said in a statement.  An attorney who represented Tarrio in his Capitol riot case didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  Tarrio_ of Miami_ was serving a 22-year sentence — the longest among hundreds of Capitol riot cases — when President Donald Trump granted clemency last month to all 1_500-plus people charged in the Jan. 6 attack.  A jury convicted Tarrio and three of his lieutenants of seditious conspiracy for a violent plot to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power from Trump to President Joe Biden after the 2020 election.  Tarrio attended a press conference Friday with other Proud Boys and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes_ who also was convicted of seditious conspiracy but freed from prison last month after Trump commuted his 18-year sentence.

292721664,Meta approved a plan that could give company executives a bonus of up to 200% of their base salary_ according to an SEC filing submitted on Thursday.The company said in the filing that the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements." The plan would increase the bonus package from 75% to 200% of its base pay_ the company said.The bonus boost would not apply to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. This is not an uncommon practice since chief executive compensation can be structured differently_ focusing more on stock options.A Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bonus boost comes amid another round of layoffs this month at Meta_ targeting 5% of its workforce which would amount to nearly 4_000 employees.Zuckerberg said the cuts were meant to target "low-performers" as company looks to streamline its operations in "an intense year" and invest heavily in artificial intelligence.But some workers who were fired previously told Business Insider that they were caught off guard by the move because they had recently been given an "At or Above Expectations" ratings in Meta's midyear reviews in 2024."When I received the email I was surprised by it mostly because I have a very solid performance history and no indicators of the last six months of performance problems_" one worker impacted by the layoffs said."Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations_ does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar_" a Meta spokesperson previously told BI in an email. "Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance."

293299970,ROME — Pope Francis was in critical condition Saturday after he suffered a long asthmatic respiratory crisis that required high flows of oxygen_ the Vatican said.  The 88-year-old Francis_ who has been hospitalized for a week with a complex lung infection_ also received blood transfusions after tests showed a condition associated with anemia_ the Vatican said in a late update.  “The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved_” the statement said.  Earlier_ doctors said that Francis was battling a pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection that doctors say remains touch-and-go and will keep him hospitalized for at least another week.  The Vatican carried on with its Holy Year celebrations without the pope on Saturday.  In a brief earlier update on Saturday_ Francis slept well overnight.  But doctors have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis_ a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday_ there was no evidence of any sepsis_ and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking_ the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition.  “He is not out of danger_” said his personal physician_ Dr. Luigi Carbone. “So like all fragile patients I say they are always on the golden scale: In other words_ it takes very little to become unbalanced.”  Francis_ who has chronic lung disease_ was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened.  Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral_ bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed “absolute rest” and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics_ along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it.  Carbone_ who along with Francis' personal nurse Massimiliano Strappetti organized care for him at the Vatican_ acknowledged he had insisted on staying at the Vatican to work_ even after he was sick_ “because of institutional and private commitments.” He was cared for by a cardiologist and infectious specialist in addition to his personal medical team before being hospitalized.  Dr. Sergio Alfieri_ the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital_ said the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream_ causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.  “Sepsis_ with his respiratory problems and his age_ would be really difficult to get out of_” Alfieri told a news conference Friday at Gemelli. “The English say ‘knock on wood_’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want_” he said as he tapped the microphone. “But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.”  “He knows he's in danger_” Alfieri added. “And he told us to relay that.”  Deacons_ meanwhile_ were gathering at the Vatican for their special Jubilee weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year_ the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend_ Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons_ a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood.  In his place_ the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass_ the Vatican said. And for the second weekend in a row_ Francis was expected to skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing_ which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it.  “Look_ even though he's not (physically) here_ we know he's here_” said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo_ a deacon from Ponce_ Puerto Rico who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. “He's recovering_ but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us because our prayers and his go together.”  Beyond that_ doctors have said Francis' recovery will take time and that regardless he will still have to live with his chronic respiratory problems back at the Vatican.  “He has to get over this infection and we all hope he gets over it_” said Alfieri. “But the fact is_ all doors are open.”  Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US_ with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

293166372,Hamas has today handed over two of six Israeli hostages due to be freed from the Gaza Strip_ as the body of murdered mother-of-two Shiri Bibas was handed back to her grieving family following a vile mix-up.   Tal Shoham and Avera Mengistu have been handed over to the Red Cross_ after being paraded on stage by masked gunmen_ as we have seen in previous handovers.  The six Israeli men set for release today are expected to be the last living hostages freed during the ceasefire’s first phase.  They include Eliya Cohen_ 27; Omer Shem Tov_ 22; and Omer Wenkert_ 23. All three were abducted from a music festival during the Oct. 7 attack. Tal Shoham_ 40_ who was taken from the community of Kibbutz Beeri_ is also set to be released.  On top of these four men_ Avera Mengistu_ 39_ and Hisham Al-Sayed_ 36_ who have been held since crossing into Gaza on their own years ago_ are set to be released.   Three white vehicles have arrived at the site of the ceremony in Rafah_ and two female representatives from the Red Cross were seen on the stage signing papers.   It comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed retribution after what he called ‘a cruel and malicious violation’ of the agreement by misidentifying bodies.  The family of Shiri Bibas said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains released overnight are those of the Israeli mother.   Israeli authorities said they had positively identified the bodies of Bibas’s two young sons_ Kfir and Ariel Bibas_ and of Oded Lifshitz_ but that the fourth body was an unidentified woman from Gaza.   However_ amid the already tense hostage exchange_ the IDF has accused Hamas of murdering siblings Ariel and Kfir ‘with their bare hands’.   ‘For 16 months we sought certainty_ and now that it’s here_ it brings no comfort_ though we hope it marks the beginning of closure_’ the Bibas family said.  The Foreign Secretary_ David Lammy has called Hamas’s failure to return the right body of an Israeli hostage ‘sick and abhorrent’.   Israel said its tests determined that the hostages had been killed by their captors. Hamas has claimed Lifshitz and the members of the Bibas family were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.  Hamas said it would ‘conduct a thorough review’ of information regarding the body and suggested that Israeli bombing of the area where hostages were held might have caused a mix-up of remains.  The group’s military wing_ the Al-Qassam Brigades_ said it would go ahead with the release of the six Israeli hostages planned for Saturday.  The dispute over the body’s identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal_ which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase_ in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal_ are likely to be even more difficult.  On Saturday morning_ hundreds of people gathered in a rainy Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip as Hamas prepared to release the hostages.  More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will be freed in exchange_ the Palestinian prisoners media office said Friday. The prisoners set for release include 50 serving life sentences_ 60 with long sentences_ 47 who were released under a previous hostage-for-prisoner exchange and 445 prisoners from Gaza arrested since the war began.  Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week_ completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out_ Hamas would retain about 60 hostages_ about half of whom are believed to be alive.  Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu_ with the full backing of the Trump administration_ says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages_ goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.  Trump’s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries.  Trump said Friday that he was ‘a little surprised’ by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it.  ‘I’ll tell you_ the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it_’ Trump said in a Fox News interview.  Israel’s military offensive killed more than 48_000 Palestinians_ mostly women and children_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry_ which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17_000 fighters_ without providing evidence.  The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza_ reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height_ the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.
293141868,She was the Most Beautiful Woman in Puppetland.  She had a pretty good run on TV_ too.   Lynne Marie Stewart_ known for playing the ethereal Miss Yvonne on “Pee-wee’s Playhouse_” has died_ her friends shared in memorial posts on social media Friday night.   Those friends_ Cassandra Peterson_ aka Elvira_ and “Saturday Night Live” alum Laraine Newman_ remembered the 78-year-old actor as a TV icon_ kindhearted person and treasured member of the Groundlings improv and sketch comedy troupe in Los Angeles.   “My heart is breaking upon hearing the news of my dear friend Lynne Stewart’s passing_“ Peterson said in an Instagram post. ”One of the kindest_ sweetest_ funniest women who ever lived. The iconic Miss Yvonne of Pee-wee’s Playhouse: She’ll always be ‘the most beautiful woman in Puppetland.’"  “The most beautiful girl in Puppetland has left us_” Newman said in another post. “Lynne Stewart was truly an angel and brilliantly funny and an important part of our Groundlings family. As my sister said ‘if you don’t love Lynne_ you’re just wrong.‘”  Stewart_ a Los Angeles native_ met Paul Reubens_ Pee-wee Herman himself_ as a member of the Groundlings in the 1970s. At the Groundlings_ Stewart also met Phil Hartman_ who played Captain Carl on “Pee-wee’s Playhouse.”  As the lovely_ glowing Miss Yvonne_ she joined Herman_ who created and played the famous bowtied character_ onstage in the original 1981 “Pee-wee Herman Show” (Captain Carl was her romantic interest.)   Stewart reprised the role of Miss Yvonne when Herman starred as Pee-wee Herman in the iconic Saturday morning children’s show “Pee-Wee’s Playhouse” on CBS. The TV series_ which aired from 1986 to 1990_ had less adult humor than the stage show_ but retained some tongue-in-cheek flirtations.   The actor followed Reubens to the big screen in Tim Burton’s feature debut “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure” (1985) and a follow-up film_ “Big Top Pee-wee” (1988). She didn’t play Yvonne in the films_ but popped up as Mother Superior in the first and Zelda_ a bearded lady_ in the second.  Stewart was also there when Reubens revived Pee-wee for a stage show that made it to Broadway in 2010.

293080460,A federal judge on Friday blocked a sweeping executive order from President Trump that sought to end government support for programs promoting diversity_ equity and inclusion.Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore found it likely violates free-speech rights and granted an injunction blocking the funding withdrawal as a lawsuit plays out. Mr. Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all "equity-related" grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don't promote DEI.The plaintiffs â including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups â sued the Trump administration earlier this month_ arguing the executive orders are unconstitutional and a blatant overreach of presidential authority. They also allege the directives have a chilling effect on free speech.The Trump administration has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws.Abelson_ who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden_ agreed with the plaintiffs that the executive orders discourage businesses_ organizations and public entities from openly supporting diversity_ equity and inclusion. "The harm arises from the issuance of it as a public_ vague_ threatening executive order_" he said during a hearing this week.Abelson's order does allow for the attorney general to investigate and prepare a report on DEI practices.

293426798,VATICAN CITY – Pope Francis_ who is battling double pneumonia in hospital_ had a “tranquil” night and rested_ the Vatican said on Sunday.  The pope was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on February 14 after experiencing difficulty breathing for several days and subsequently had pneumonia diagnosed in both lungs.  The Vatican described his condition as critical for the first time on Saturday_ reporting that the 88-year-old Francis had needed supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions that day.  “The night was tranquil_ the pope rested_” the Vatican said in a one-sentence update on Sunday morning without providing further information.  Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs_ making it difficult to breathe.   The Vatican has described the pope’s infection as “complex_” saying it is being caused by two or more microorganisms.  Francis_ who has been pope since 2013_ has suffered bouts of ill health in the past two years. He is particularly prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.  In a statement on Saturday evening_ the Vatican said the pope had suffered a “prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis” that had required administration of “high-flow oxygen.”  It said he had also needed blood transfusions because tests showed he had a low platelet count_ which is associated with anemia. Platelets are cell fragments in our blood that form clots and stop or prevent bleeding.  In a briefing on Friday_ two of his doctors said the pope was highly vulnerable because of his age and general frailty.  Dr. Sergio Alfieri_ a senior member of the Gemelli staff_ said there was a risk the lung infection could spread to his bloodstream and develop into sepsis_ which “could be very difficult to overcome.”

293359060,Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be delayed “until the release of the next hostages has been assured_ and without the humiliating ceremonies” at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza.  The statement by Benjamin Netanyahu’s office came early Sunday as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison in the Israeli-occupied West Bank_ only to turn around and go back in.  The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were on Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the current Gaza ceasefire’s first phase.  Five of the six Israeli hostages freed Saturday had been escorted by masked_ armed militants in front of a crowd – a display that the UN and others have criticized as cruel after previous handovers.  The Israeli statement cited “ceremonies that demean the dignity of our hostages and the cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes”. It was likely a reference to a Hamas video showing two hostages who have yet to be released watching a handover in Gaza on Saturday and speaking under duress.  Hamas had released the last six living hostages expected under the ceasefire’s first phase_ with a week remaining in the initial stage.  Israel’s announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt.  The 620 Palestinian prisoners meant to be freed included 445 men_ 23 children aged 15 to 19_ and a woman_ all seized by Israeli troops in Gaza without charge during the war.  Also meant to be released are 151 Palestinians serving life or other sentences for attacks against Israelis. Almost 100 would be deported_ according to the Palestinian prisoners’ media office.  A Palestinian prisoners’ rights association said they include Nael al-Barghouti_ who spent more than 45 years in prison for an attack that killed an Israeli bus driver.  Freed by Hamas on Saturday were three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others had been held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own.  Five were handed over in staged ceremonies that the Red Cross and Israel have condemned as cruel and disrespectful.  Omer Wenkert_ Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside Hamas fighters. A beaming Shem Tov_ acting under duress_ kissed two militants on the head and blew kisses to the crowd. All wore fake army uniforms_ though they were not soldiers when abducted.  Cohen’s family and friends in Israel chanted “Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!” and cheered.  “You’re heroes_” Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced_ laughing and crying. “You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.” His father_ Malki Shem Tov_ told public broadcaster Kan that his son had been held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17km (37lbs).  Earlier Saturday_ Tal Shoham_ 40_ and Avera Mengistu_ 38_ had been freed. Mengistu_ an Ethiopian Israeli_ entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. Shoham_ an Israeli Austrian_ had been taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange.  Later_ Israel’s military said Hisham Al-Sayed_ 36_ had been released. The Bedouin Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Israel’s government did not respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal_ with spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou accusing the Israeli prime minister of “deliberately stalling”.  The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas_ an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of a Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for “a cruel and malicious violation”. Hamas suggested it had been a mistake.  Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over on Friday was that of Bibas. Dr Chen Kugel_ head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine_ said no evidence had been found that Bibas and her children had been killed in an Israeli airstrike_ as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause.  Hamas denied the Israeli military claim_ based on forensic evidence and unspecified “intelligence”_ that its militants had killed the children “with their bare hands”_ calling it a lie aimed at justifying Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza.  The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas_ but there are fears the war will resume.  Hamas has said it will release four bodies next week_ completing the truce’s first phase. After that_ Hamas will hold more than 60 hostages – about half believed to be alive.  Talks on the ceasefire’s second phase are yet to start_ but negotiations are likely to be more difficult.  Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu_ with the backing of Donald Trump_ says he is committed to destroying Hamas’s military and governing capacities and returning all hostages_ goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.  Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48_000 Palestinians_ mostly women and children_ according to Gaza’s health ministry_ which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17_000 fighters_ without providing evidence.  The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza_ reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height_ the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population.  The October 7 attack killed about 1_200 people_ mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.

The area is "now secure_" the hospital added_ and officers were on location "managing the situation."   Andrew Duarte_ an officer with the West York Borough Police Department (WYBPD)_ was killed in the shooting_ the borough of West York announced on Facebook.

The suspect — who has since been identified as 49-year-old Diogenes Archangel Ortiz — went "straight to the ICU" and held members of the UPMC staff hostage_ Barker said.   The suspect shot three members of the hospital staff — including a doctor who was "grazed" by a bullet_ plus a nurse and custodian who were listed in "stable condition" as of Saturday afternoon_ the district attorney said.

293631574,Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America_ The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.  Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and   joining us daily_ there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes   to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business;   senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want   to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our   independence.  We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our   hands_ and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech_ big media and big government blockade.  We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account.   Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates   them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.  One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of   our being_ and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.  Help us save her.  A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have   trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political   spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN?

293849628,Singer Roberta Flack_ who broke through as one of the most important and beloved singers of the 1970s and beyond with a sound that combined soul_ jazz_ rock and pop_ died Monday at the age of 88.   A representative for Flack did not share a cause of death_ but the singer had been battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis_ or ALS.  Musically gifted from a young age_ Flack won a scholarship to Howard University at just 15 with plans to pursue a classical music career.  "My real ambition was to be a concert pianist_" Flack told NPR in 2012_ "and to play Schumann and Bach and Chopin - the romantics. Those were my guys."  But her teachers discouraged her from trying to break into the mostly white world of classical music in the late 1950s. Upon graduating_ Flack taught at schools in North Carolina and Washington_ D.C._ and began performing in clubs_ both as a pianist for other vocalists and as a singer herself. Attention from fellow musicians led to a contract with Atlantic Records_ who released her debut album_ First Take_ in 1969.  First Take sold well but Flack credited her 1970 appearance guest-starring on The Third Bill Cosby Special with "the biggest break of my career_" as she told The New York Times. When Clint Eastwood used her version of Ewan MacColl's "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" in his 1971 movie Play Misty For Me_ Flack's popularity soared.  The string of albums that followed — Chapter Two_ Quiet Fire_ Killing Me Softly_ Feel Like Makin' Love and an album of duets with Donny Hathaway — made her one of the decade's most popular singers. In 1971_ DownBeat Magazine named her the year's best female vocalist_ breaking Ella Fitzgerald's 18-year streak. She earned eight Grammy nominations and four wins during this period_ and remains the only solo artist to win the Grammy for record of the year two years in a row: in 1973_ for "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face_" and in 1974_ for "Killing Me Softly With His Song."  Flack's superstardom didn't always translate to critical praise. NPR's Ann Powers points out that she was winning over audiences at a time when songwriters were getting most of the attention. "The idea that you had to write your own material was was held up as the gold standard_" says Powers. "For much longer interpreters were the greats_ and Roberta Flack stands with Sinatra_ with Ella Fitzgerald_ with so many great interpreters of the 20th century_ as someone who made every song she approached original."  In the mid-'70s_ Flack's pace in the studio slowed slightly as she scored for film and TV_ worked in music publishing and record producing and engaged in graduate-level coursework in education and linguistics. She returned with Blue Lights in the Basement in 1977_ and continued releasing albums from the late '70s through the early '00s_ including another album featuring Hathaway_ a duet album with Peabo Bryson and a Christmas album. Flack continued performing around the world_ though she suffered some health setbacks in the 2010s.  In 2022_ Flack announced that she had ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)_ popularly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The following year_ she came out with The Green Piano: How Little Me Found Music_ a children's book about the time her father restored an old piano so that little Roberta could practice at home_ co-written with Tonya Bolden.  Throughout her career_ Flack built a musical legacy by working outside the confines of genre. She was known for helping to shape and define "quiet storm" R&B_ and laid the groundwork for the rise of neo-soul. But her celebrated work as an interpreter of songs included elements of rock_ folk_ jazz_ classical_ Latin and more_ continually challenging racialized conventions about popular music and influencing generations of artists.  "My main interest is in telling my story through a song — whether mine or someone else's_" Flack told NPR's Ann Powers in 2020. "Tell the truth with clarity and honesty so that the listener can feel their story."
293852338,In the depths of a lush rainforest_ a large_ draconic beast hits me square in the chest. I'm knocked back several feet and I_ with the last breath I can muster_ whistle to my seikret. It's too far away_ and all hope seems lost_ before a fellow hunter fires a healing round from across the clearing. The monster hits hard again_ but I barely scrape by as my seikret whisks me up onto its back_ where I chug down a health potion_ swap out my blade_ and leap off to face my foe once more.Monster Hunter Wilds had a big task ahead of it. Monster Hunter World was the series' big break_ attracting millions more players than past games_ and any follow-up needed to please both those players and long-time fans of the series. The task was even more complicated by Monster Hunter Rise_ a game that took big swings to differentiate itself from the slower_ more methodical action gameplay of World by speeding things up and adding massive amounts of verticality. It was a wildly different game_ but it was very well-received_ bringing a lot of big changes that many hoped would stick around.Wilds sets out to split the difference between these two experiences. Its combat is faster than Worlds_ but slower than Rise's. It's bigger and much more vertical than World_ but without Rise's wirebug – a sad casualty of a move to a more traditional game – much of that verticality is wasted.Monster Hunter Wilds bills itself as an open-world game_ and in theory_ it is. There are no transitions between areas on the map_ so you can walk from the desert area to the forest area without ever seeing a loading screen. In practice_ though_ it's a distinction without a difference — walking from one map to another is a nice novelty_ but all of your hunts will take place within a single area_ and it's quicker and easier to just fast travel to the relevant area. There's next to no difference between the structure of a game like Wilds compared to World or Rise_ even if it looks good on paper.The "open-world" structure does lead to some well-needed improvements_ though. No longer are you tied to preparing a meal at your operating base_ instead having full cooking capabilities in any pop-up camp you set up. You have a lot more freedom as to where you place those pop-up camps_ too_ and even though they can be destroyed by monsters if you place them in precarious locales_ being able to drop one down on the edge of a monster's stomping ground makes getting back into the hunt after a cart much quicker.The monsters you're hunting in Wilds are excellent_ too. There's a wide variety of monsters_ including all-new types of monsters that definitely caused me some grief. Wilds does fall into the series-long trap of slapping new textures over monsters you've fought earlier in the game_ but it's easily forgivable with how enjoyable those monsters are to hunt. They're fast and ferocious_ with quite a few tricks up their sleeves_ keeping you on your toes on every hunt_ and most of them are presented with such spectacle that it's easy to see Wilds' budget has increased significantly compared to prior games.The combat is at the heart of any Monster Hunter game_ and Wilds excels here. As mentioned_ the wirebug is gone_ so you won't be launching yourself into the air to smack a monster in the face_ but there are plenty of new tools in the chest to take advantage of. Key to these – at least in my case as a switch axe wielder – is a counterattack system that requires timing specific attacks just as your fierce foe is about to strike. It means you have to learn how a monster moves and shakes_ and when it's about to strike so you can hit back with a powerful strike of your own. It also means knowing exactly what your weapons do_ when to commit to a combo_ and when you need to ease up so you're free for a counterattack. It's a nice mix of the overpowered_ fast-paced combat of Rise and World's slower_ more methodical approach_ and it feels fantastic.The addition of the seikret is an interesting choice_ too_ and one that I'm very mixed on. It's nice to be able to call it in combat_ set it to auto-follow your target_ and spend a little bit of time healing and sharpening your weapon. That it can automatically lead you to your target at the start of a hunt_ or follow a monster that's fled after taking heavy damage_ is a nice touch_ too. But something about it feels a little lackluster_ in part because Monster Hunter already did it better with the Palamute in Rise. The seikret feels like a cheap imitation by comparison — it won't fight by your side_ and it handles much more poorly. It can glide_ at least. That's something.One other addition of note is the slinger_ which lets you fire out a line to grab resources like herbs and flash pods from afar. It can occasionally be used similarly to the wirebug_ thanks to some floating bugs in arenas now and then_ but it's mostly used for grabbing a few things while your seikret navigates to your next location. It's nice_ but the inability to use it while your weapon is out makes it feel like an afterthought.Wilds also has a very heavy focus on story_ with a regular cast of characters who'll be by your side throughout the game. Getting to know these characters is part of the charm of the game_ and having a player character who speaks and interacts with the cast makes it all the more immersive. I think the character writing is especially well-done_ although it does stray a little bit into cheesy at times. Still_ I've adored going on this journey with Gemma_ Alma_ Nata_ Olivia_ and Erik — and the fact that I can name all of them means they've made more of an impact than any Monster Hunter character in past games.Monster Hunter Wilds is a game that tries to split the difference between two wildly disparate experiences_ and for better or worse_ it pulls that balance off. There are aspects that are greatly improved from World_ like a significantly improved onboarding process and NPC hunting buddies_ but it falls short of the big changes Rise brought with it. That's not necessarily a bad thing_ but it's still a step forward and a step back at the same time_ leading to a game that feels less like an evolution of the series and more like a refinement of everything that's come before it. There's no doubt that I'll spend another 300 hours hunting monsters in this game_ but I'm still left wanting and wondering what's truly next for the series.
293863858,Lester Holt_ the anchor and managing editor of “NBC Nightly News” for a decade_ announced Monday that he is stepping down from the long-running broadcast at the beginning of the summer.

293814356,Elon Musk’s email has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers looming with chaos and confusion as they begin their working week this Monday. It seems that they are now facing a deadline from President Donald Trump’s cost-efficiency chief Elon Musk. Apparently_ workers have been asked to explain their recent work and accomplishments_ or they might be at risk of losing their jobs.  The billionaire’s unusual demand is facing resistance from various key US agencies led by the loyalists of the president. This includes the FBI_ Homeland Security_ State Department and the Pentagon_ which instructed their employees not to comply with this over the weekend.  Lawmakers of both parties said that Elon Musk’s mandate might be illegal_ while unions have threatened to sue.  Elon Musk’s bullsh*t “what did you do last week” emails were sent to: — Air traffic controllers who ensure flying is safe. — VA Crisis Line workers_ doctors and staff who care for our Veterans. — DoD personnel who defend our national security. — Scores of other federal… — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) February 23_ 2025  Donald Trump_ over the weekend_ had called for Elon Musk and asked him to be more aggressive in his cost-cutting crusade. Musk has been asked to do so through the newly founded Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE. They even posted a meme on social media where they mocked federal employees who “cried about Trump and Elon”.  Elon Musk’s team sent an email to hundreds of thousands of federal workers on Saturday. He gave them around 48 hours to respond and asked them to five specific things they worked on or accomplished last week. In a different message on X_ Musk said that any employee who fails to answer by the deadline (11:59 pm ET on Monday) will lose their job.   On the eve of the deadline_ there was widespread confusion around Elon Musk’s message as some agencies opposed the directive_ others urged their employees to implement it_ and still others provided contradictory advice_ as per BBC.   Nearly 80_000 employees of the Department of Health and Human Services_ under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr._ were told to comply in one message sent Sunday morning. That came soon after Sean Keveney_ the acting general counsel_ told some not to.  Additionally_ by Sunday evening_ agency leadership had released additional directives directing staff to “pause activities” pertaining to the request until Monday at noon.  “I’ll tell you straight. In an email seen by The Associated Press_ Mr Keveney recognised a general feeling of “uncertainty and stress” within the agency_ saying_ “After putting in over 70 hours of work last week advancing Administration’s priorities_ I was personally insulted to receive the below email.”  Musk emails federal employees: “Explain what work you did last week in 5 bullets and cc your manager. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” This is ridiculous pic.twitter.com/7TwLfW2crw — A (@bluhue123) February 23_ 2025  Lately_ there has been a request from over a dozen states for a court order prohibiting the Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE_ from accessing computer systems at seven federal agencies or firing government employees. At the same time_ legal proceedings are ongoing and have been temporarily denied by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan of Washington.  In her decision_ Chutkan wrote that the states “legitimately call into question what appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight.” But the judge said the states had not shown why they were entitled to an immediate restraining order.
293743410,A dozen leaders from Europe and Canada visited Ukraine’s capital Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion in a show of support by some of Kyiv’s most important backers for the nation at war.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among the visitors greeted at the train station by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and the president’s chief of staff Andrii Yermak.  In a post on X_ von der Leyen wrote that Europe was in Kyiv “because Ukraine is in Europe.”  “In this fight for survival_ it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny_” she wrote.  The guests_ also including European Council President Antonio Costa as well as the prime ministers of Northern European countries and Spain_ were set to attend events dedicated to the anniversary and discuss supporting Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid a recent US policy shift under President Donald Trump.  In the latest sign of Europe’s efforts to rework its strategy on Ukraine to respond to Trump’s actions_ Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6_ with Ukraine at the top of the agenda.  “We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security_” Costa said in a post on social media.  The three-year mark of the war in Ukraine came at a sensitive moment for Kyiv as Zelenskyy navigates a rapidly changing international environment upended by Trump’s changes to the US approach to the war.  The US leader has sought to follow through on his campaign promises to end the war quickly_ though his methods for doing so have alarmed many in Ukraine and Europe who believe that his approach is too conciliatory toward Russia and its president_ Vladimir Putin.  Russia’s foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway_ and US officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation.  And on Sunday_ Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state TASS news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week_ adding that “quite a lot” of contact was ongoing between the Russian and American sides.  Leaders across the EU_ fearing both that Trump’s approach to Ukraine would lead to an unfavorable settlement for Kyiv and that they — some of Ukraine’s most important supporters — would be sidelined in negotiation for peace_ have rushed to assert their own response to the rapidly shifting environment.  The EU’s top diplomat on Monday insisted that the US cannot seal any peace deal to end the war with Putin without Ukraine or Europe being involved.  Kaja Kallas highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration.  “You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine_ then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal_” Kallas told reporters in Brussels_ where she is chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers.  Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  Asked whether the US administration is acting in the interests of Russia or Ukraine’s Western backers_ she said: “If you look at the messages that come from the United States_ then it’s clear that the Russian narrative is there very strongly represented.”  Kallas rejected Trump’s earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year_ saying_ “Putin hasn’t had elections_ or Russia hasn’t had elections_ in 25 years.”  Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place_ and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted “there will be elections and people will make their choice.”  The UK was expected to announce new sanctions against Russia on Monday_ having earlier described them as the biggest package since the early days of the war.  Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Sunday said the measures would be aimed at eroding Russia’s “military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine.”  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal.  Meanwhile_ Ukrainian air defenses downed 113 drones launched by Russia at 12 regions overnight_ with another 71 “lost_” according to the daily Air Force report.  The report said that as a result of the attack_ Dnipropetrovsk_ Odessa_ Kyiv_ and Khmelnytskyi regions “suffered_” but did not provide further details.  On Sunday_ the eve of the war’s three-year anniversary_ Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 267 drones into Ukraine overnight_ more than in any other single attack of the war.
293716666,ROME -- Pope Francis was resting Monday morning after a quiet night_ on the 10th day of his hospitalization for a complex lung infection that has provoked the early stages of kidney failure_ the Vatican said.  The one-line statement didn’t say if Francis_ 88_ had woken up. “The night passed well_ the pope slept and is resting_” it said.  Late Sunday_ doctors reported that blood tests showed early kidney failure that was nevertheless under control. They said Francis remained in critical condition but that he hadn't experienced any further respiratory crises since Saturday.   He was receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen and_ on Sunday_ was alert_ responsive and attended Mass. They said his prognosis was guarded.  Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go_ given his age_ fragility and pre-existing lung disease. They have warned that the main threat facing Francis is sepsis_ a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia.   To date there has been no reference to any onset of sepsis in the medical updates provided by the Vatican_ including on Sunday.  Monday marks Francis’ 10th day in the hospital_ making this equal to the longest hospitalization of his papacy. He spent 10 days at Rome’s Gemelli hospital in 2021 after he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed.  In New York on Sunday_ Cardinal Timothy Dolan acknowledged what church leaders in Rome weren’t saying publicly: that the Catholic faithful were united “at the bedside of a dying father.”  “As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very_ very fragile health_ and probably close to death_” Dolan said in his homily from the pulpit of St. Patrick’s Cathedral_ though he later told reporters he hoped and prayed that Francis would “bounce back.”  Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go_ given his age_ fragility and pre-existing lung disease. His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated_ and whether he might resign.

You’re paying close attention to what others are going through_ though the time is not quite right for bringing it up. These things are best handled with emotional discretion. When in doubt_ saying little and feeling lots won’t steer you wrong.  GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You let go of wanting things to be a certain way. You’d rather know the truth of how things are_ and the honesty with which they rest and balance than see them falsely. To embrace ambiguity is to fully experience life’s richness.

Humble_ selfless_ confident_ brave_ an encyclopedia of knowledge and experience about the 20th century until now. He knew history because he lived it."   Hill was assigned to Jackie Kennedy's security detail in 1960_ and accompanied the first couple to Dallas on their fateful 1963 campaign trip. On Nov. 22_ he was in the motorcade — just behind the president's limousine — as they made their way to the Dallas Trade Mart where the president was scheduled to give a speech.   When a shot rang out_ he kept his eyes trained on the president_ who then grabbed his throat and fell to his left. Hill jumped off of his vehicle and then ran to the presidential limousine amid gunfire. He leapt onto the car_ attempting to form a barrier between the gunman and the first couple_ risking his life to save theirs.   In his most recent book_ My Travels with Mrs. Kennedy_ Hill revealed that he was so overwrought with guilt in the weeks after JFK's assassination that he contemplated suicide   In December of 1963_ Hill_ who was the lead agent on Jackie's detail_ traveled to Palm Beach_ Fla._ to accompany the first lady and her two young children_ Caroline and John_ while they visited with the Kennedy family.   On that trip_ he recounted one night when he could not escape the horrors of the assassination. "Guilt and anguish consumed me. All I could think about was Dallas. I was running as fast as I could_ my arm reaching for the handholds on the trunk but it was like my legs were in quicksand. Mrs. Kennedy climbing out of the back seat_ her terrified eyes looking but not seeing me_ like I wasn't there."   Overcome by the memory_ he walked out into the ocean_ fully clothed. "Tears streamed down my cheeks_ and as the cold water enveloped my legs_ and then my chest_ and up to my shoulders_ the tears turned to sobs_" he wrote. "I wanted the water to swallow me up."   Over the roar of the waves_ he heard someone call his name_ and suddenly a Palm Beach police officer was dragging him out of the ocean.   Revealing the truth years later_ he said_ was somewhat cathartic. "Somehow_ there is a sense of freedom in no longer keeping that darkness to myself_" he wrote. "People will judge me_ I'm sure. But no one — no one — has ever walked in my shoes."   Hill_ who joined the Secret Service in 1958_ served five presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower_ John F. Kennedy_ Lyndon B. Johnson_ Richard M. Nixon_ and Gerald Ford. He was a witness to history_ and would always be remembered for his courage on Nov. 22_ 1963.   In a commemorative edition of his book Five Days in November — his firsthand account of the assassination_ co-written with his wife — Hill countered conspiracy theories that have long surrounding the assassination.   Speaking to PEOPLE_ he said he was one of “very few people left who were present that day_"noting_ "we’ll all be gone soon and there will be no one left to tell the facts."   “I thought it was important to get this out there — the factual documentation of what happened on Nov. 22_ 1963.”   Still_ 60 years after that day_ the memories were never far away.   As he told PEOPLE in 2023: “There's never been any closure. I’m reminded of it every day_ whether it’s a photograph or a magazine or newspaper.”    Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.   “I should have done more_" Hill continued. "I should have gotten there quickly_ but I know I’m not faster than a speeding bullet. But that causes me guilt that is difficult to live with.”   Hill is survived by his wife_ Lisa McCubbin Hill_ his two sons_ Chris Hill and Corey Hill_ five grandchildren and two step-grandsons.
294215554,By MARK SHERMAN_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the murder conviction and death penalty for Richard Glossip_ an Oklahoma man who has steadfastly maintained his innocence and averted multiple attempts by the state to execute him.  The justices found that Glossip’s trial violated his constitutional rights.  The justices heard arguments in October in a case that produced a rare alliance in which lawyers for Glossip and the state argued that the high court should overturn Glossip’s conviction and death sentence because he did not get a fair trial.  The victim’s relatives had told the high court that they want to see Glossip executed.  Oklahoma’s top criminal appeals court had repeatedly upheld the conviction and sentence_ even after the state sided with Glossip.  Glossip was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1997 killing in Oklahoma City of his former boss_ motel owner Barry Van Treese_ in what prosecutors have alleged was a murder-for-hire scheme.  Glossip has always maintained his innocence. Another man_ Justin Sneed_ admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10_000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.

Today_ I learned a different definition of prism than I was aware of thanks to the blue category. My main reference point is optical prisms involving transparent material cut specifically for analyzing light. However_ the geometric version is simply a shape with two opposite and equal parrallel planes. To be honest_ I was terrible at geometry in school instead preferring the lingual math of algebra. Anyway_ I got brick_ fish tank_ microwave and shoebox based on a simpler idea of rectangles. Moving on_ we picked up gusto_ passion_ relish and zest for the yellow enthusiasm. I had no clues for purple so I put in the green category next with beaucoup_ molto_ mucho and multi meaning many. Our purple group today involved U.S. currency rhymes; Jenny (penny)_ lime (dime)_ mortar (quarter)_ and pickle (nickle).

Here are the Connections answers for game #624_ which had a difficulty rating of 4 out of 5_ according to the Connections Companion.  Today's Connections clues seemed to have a pirate theme going on_ which immediately had my hackles raised that it could be a red herring. After striking out once by trying to shoehorn in the clue Swallow_ I ate up the yellow category with Gobble_ Gulp_ Scarf_ and Wolf. When I drew a blank on where to go next_ I decided to reevaluate my skepticism about the whole pirate thing. You can imagine my surprise when the blue category ended up being nautical-themed with Anchor_ Compass_ Mermaid_ and Swallow. I really scratched my head trying to tie Butte together with anything_ but came up short. Though all that reaching helped me make the connection for today's green category_ Bow_ Buckle_ Cave_ and Give. Purple was today's rote fill again with Butte_ China_ Hearth_ and Shine_ and it was a particularly tricky one.

294215552,By MICHAEL LIEDTKE_ Associated Press Technology Writer  Apple shareholders are expected to reject an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into scrapping corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.  The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urges Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity_ equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump.  Tuesday’s shareholder vote comes a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco’s annual meeting_ only to have it overwhelmingly rejected. A similar outcome is expected during Apple’s annual meeting despite the vocal objections of critics.  Just as Costco does_ Apple has steadfastly stood behind diversity and inclusion efforts that its management contends make good business sense.  But the National Center for Public Policy Research’s proposal has attacked Apple’s diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino_ California_ company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. The group estimated about 50_000 Apple employees could file cases against Apple without detailing how it arrived at that figure.  “It’s clear that DEI poses litigation_ reputational and financial risks to companies_ and therefore financial risks to their shareholders_ and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties_” the National Center for Public Policy Research says in its proposal.  The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer’s recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.  In its rebuttal to the anti-DEI proposal_ Apple said its program is an integral part of a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world.  “We believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world_” the company said in its statement against the proposal. “We seek to conduct business ethically_ honestly_ and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.”  In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022_ Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.  Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men_ especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue what have been largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.
294234494,By BRIAN SLODYSKO and BYRON TAU  WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency_ saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.”  “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations_” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter_ a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However_ it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.”  The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.  The mass resignation of engineers_ data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall_ stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning.  The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service_ an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov_ the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law.  All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.  Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration_ the staffers wrote_ they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE.  According to the staffers_ people wearing White House visitors’ badges_ some of whom would not give their names_ grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology.  “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves_ asked questions about political loyalty_ attempted to pit colleagues against each other_ and demonstrated limited technical ability_” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.”  Earlier this month_ about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint_ they wrote.  “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security_ veterans’ services_ tax filing_ health care_ disaster relief_ student aid_ and other critical services_” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.”  Those who remained_ about 65 staffers_ were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday.  “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems_ jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data_ or dismantle critical public services_” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.”  The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE_ a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin_ was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government.  After the election_ however_ Musk hinted there was more to come_ posting to his social media site_ X_ “Threat to democracy? Nope_ threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since.  Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington_ where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out_ Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei.  “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy_” Musk bellowed from the stage.  Still_ Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place_ with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers_ product managers_ human resources and contracting staff_ according to interviews with current and former staff.  Of the 40 people let go earlier this month_ only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens_ who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris_ a Democrat_ on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues.  “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans_” Kamens said.  U.S. Digital Service veterans_ who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal_ recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time_ many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector.  “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well_ the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government_ you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that_” said Cordell Schachter_ who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation.  USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans_ and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology.  It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.  AP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston.

294215166,Throughout the 2024-25 season_ Washington Commanders defensive end Jonathan Allen had a series of injuries. However_ his time in D.C. might be coming to an end. According to Fox Sports NFL insider Jordan Schultz_ the team officially permitted him to seek a trade. The two-time Pro Bowler has spent his entire career with the Commanders. He only played in eight games this season and started in seven. The 30-year-old defensive tackle could intrigue plenty of interest from teams across the league. Despite his recent injury history_ he’s been productive when healthy. Still_ his production has been solid over the past few seasons. Although Washington was a mediocre team_ that wasn’t the case this season. As a result_ they went 12-5 and made it to the NFC Championship game. The Commanders beat the Detroit Lions_ which were one of the favorites to make the Super Bowl and represent the NFC. It didn’t matter though_ as they were routed by their rival_ the Philadelphia Eagles. Regardless of that outcome_ it’s clear that they want to build around Jayden Daniels. They’ll want young players to fit that mold on both sides of the ball. With Allen’s age and injury history_ it might not be what the Commanders are looking for. Jonathan Allen leaves consistency with Commanders As mentioned before_ he was one of the staples of the franchise. Throughout the ownership changes and carousel of head coaches_ he remained devoted to the franchise. Because of this_ Allen was a surprise name if the Commanders would cut him. A younger defensive group could use Allen’s leadership on the gridiron. Either way_ the trade will likely take time. It could be a part of the 2025 NFL Draft_ or it could be once specific salaries clear up. His contract carries a dead cap hit of $22 million if he were to be traded. The franchise could wait to trade him until that period passes by. The Cleveland Browns have a similar situation with Myles Garrett. The latter has a near $30 million dead cap hit if he were to be traded before the 2025 NFL Draft. It’s not certain if the same will happen with Allen. However_ letting him know to seek a trade can help Washington present all available options. Both sides seem to be in agreement that they want to move on. It can help Allen and the Commanders find a mutually beneficial deal. No matter what_ if he is dealt_ fans will appreciate his consistency during the toughest stretches of the franchise.

294067826,Jon Stewart's appearance on Monday night's episode of The Daily Show left him bloodied after he smashed a coffee mug while ranting about the high price of prescription drugs.   See the moment he cuts his hand on a shattered mug at about 16:58 in the video below.   It happened during his monologue about the high cost Americans pay for prescription drugs_ which he began by showing a clip of former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris standing before a crowd_ promoting what a news anchor called "the first ever negotiation with pharmaceutical companies" and announcing that they'd come to an agreement to lower the price of 10 drugs.   "But you know what's so horrible about our system now? And the corruption that lays within it?" Stewart asked. "We're so f---ing numb to it_ we actually tout tiny cracks in that exploitation as victory."   He grew increasingly angry but also brought out one of his humorous voice effects.   "Ooh_ can it be? The companies we subsidize with billions of dollars are allowing us the privilege of negotiating the price of 10 of their drugs_" Stewart said sarcastically. "And 10 is all of them_ right? It would be embarrassing if it was a small drop in the bucket and that the American people didn't expect that we should negotiate for all their f---ing drugs! Because we've already paid for 'em with our subsidies!"   Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news_ exclusive first looks_ recaps_ reviews_ interviews with your favorite stars_ and more.   He slammed his coffee mug down and the audience seemed to pick up on the fact something had gone wrong_ but they cheered. Stewart then looked down at his hand to inspect it_ smiled_ and jovially said_ "I'll be going to the hospital soon."   Stewart continued with his report after the slam_ holding his injured right hand below the desk_ and acted as if nothing had happened. But when he pulled his hand up into view later — about 21:32 in the video — the audience gasped at the blood. Stewart made light of the injury on social media_ calling the episode a "bloody good episode" and himself "an idiot."   In the second part of the show_ Stewart spoke with Georgetown Law's Rupa Bhattacharyya_ who is the former Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund_ about how deep_ indiscriminate budget cuts Donald Trump administration advisor Elon Musk and his DOGE foot soldiers are making affect programs like the one she once oversaw.   "It makes me so angry_ I want to smash another mug_" Stewart said_ lifting his hand into view and looking down at his bloody_ bandaged finger. "Oh_ wow_ this thing's really coming out.

294490340,Apple has promised to fix a bug in its iPhone automatic dictation tool after some users reported it had suggested to them “Trump” when they said the word “racist”.  The glitch was first highlighted in a viral post on TikTok_ when the speech-to-text tool sometimes briefly flashed up the word “Trump” when they said “racist”_ and was later repeated by others on social media.  “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers dictation and we are rolling out a fix_” an Apple spokesperson said.  The company blamed the bug on its tool displaying words that have “phonetic overlap” before the “intended word” is identified_ which in this case included words with the “r” consonant.  However_ the glitch caused outrage among some conservative commentators in the US_ who have long accused big tech companies of political bias against those on the right.  The bug also called into question Apple’s artificial intelligence capabilities_ only a day after the company announced a $500bn (£395bn) investment in the US_ widely interpreted as a move designed to appeal to Donald Trump’s government.  The tech company said on Monday that the investment_ running over the next four years_ would include a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers and would create about 20_000 research and development jobs across the country.  The AI announcement came only days after Apple’s chief executive_ Tim Cook_ reportedly met Trump. The company could face 10% tariffs on its devices_ many of which are assembled in China before being imported into the US.  The maker of the iPhone did manage to secure some waivers on tariffs levied on China during Trump’s first term.  It is not the first time Apple has announced a multibillion-dollar investment in the US economy during a Trump administration. In 2018_ during his first term in the White House_ Apple said that new and ongoing investments would contribute $350bn to the US economy over five years.  Since Trump’s election and his signing of a slew of executive orders overturning diversity_ equity and inclusion measures in the federal government_ many in the tech sector have followed suit with a rollback of similar schemes – including Google_ Amazon and Meta. However_ on Tuesday Apple shareholders voted down a proposal urging the company to drop its own DEI programmes.

294615460,With David Shipley stepping down as editor of The Washington Post opinion pages_ the newspaper’s owner_ Jeff Bezos_ has announced a dramatic shift in focus for the storied publication.   “I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages. We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets_” Bezos said on X on Tuesday.   The move would appear to bring the Post more in line with Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal opinion section_ which has touted free markets along with conservative social viewpoints since he purchased the paper for $5 billion in 2007. And_ similarly_ The Economist and Michael Bloomberg’s Bloomberg Opinion tread in related territory.   Will Lewis_ publisher and CEO of the paper_ added in his own statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter: “I want to thank him (Bezos) for clearly and succinctly spelling out what we stand for at The Washington Post_ and I will be so very proud for The Post to be known for its two key pillars: our belief in free markets and personal liberties.”   Lewis added Shipley will leave The Washington Post on Friday after two years in the post as opinion pages editor. Bezos in his X post said he offered Shipley an opportunity to remain with the new-look opinion pages_ but was turned down.    “I ask everyone to join me in thanking him (Shipley) for his service to our paper and our readers_ as well as wishing him the best of luck in his future endeavors. I will be putting interim arrangements in place. David’s replacement will be announced in due course_” Lewis added.   Jeff Bezo’s social media post follows in full:   I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages. We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course_ but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. There was a time when a newspaper_ especially one that was a local monopoly_ might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today_ the internet does that job. I am of America and for America_ and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical.   And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity_ invention_ and prosperity. I offered David Shipley_ whom I greatly admire_ the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t “hell yes_” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration_ David decided to step away. This is a significant shift_ it won’t be easy_ and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction. I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.    Will Lewis’ note to Washington Post staff also follows in full:   Earlier today_ our owner Jeff published a note explaining The Washington Post’s recalibrated content strategy for our opinion section. I want to thank him for clearly and succinctly spelling out what we stand for at The Washington Post_ and I will be so very proud for The Post to be known for its two key pillars: our belief in free markets and personal liberties. I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency_ and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every day.   This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans. With this coming change_ David Shipley has decided to depart as the Editor of the Opinions section. David has been with us for just over two years and_ in that time_ has overseen a department and body of work that has resulted in two Pulitzer Prizes and two Loeb Awards.David leaves us this Friday_ and I ask everyone to join me in thanking him for his service to our paper and our readers_ as well as wishing him the best of luck in his future endeavors.   I will be putting interim arrangements in place. David’s replacement will be announced in due course. It will be someone who is wholehearted in their support for free markets and personal liberties.
294595542,An American Airlines flight was forced to abort its landing at DC’s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to avoid a plane taking off on the same runway — less than a month after a midair collision killed 67 people near the same airport.  The latest aviation mishap unfolded Tuesday as the Airbus A319_ which was en route from Boston_ was preparing to touch down just before 8:30 a.m._ CBS News reported.  “An air traffic controller instructed American Flight 2246 to perform a go-around at Ronald Reagan Washington National (DCA) Airport to ensure separation was maintained between this aircraft and a preceding departure from the same runway_” the Federal Aviation Administration said.  The airline described the incident as a standard go-around.  Still_ it comes just weeks after an American Airlines jet went down in the nearby Potomac River after a midair collision with an Army helicopter.  The 60 passengers and four crew members on board were killed_ as well as the three soldiers in the Black Hawk.
294411752,Luka Doncic_ now a part of the Lakers_ unconventionally did some push-ups during his pregame routine on Tuesday_ knowing his ex-general manager_ Nico Harrison_ was in the building and perhaps trying to send a message. Just weeks ago_ the NBA saw one of the most unexpected trades in league history go down_ with Doncic (an elite talent approaching his prime) landing on a marquee squad like the Lakers. In a tense_ nicely entertaining showdown at Crypto.com Arena_ LA outlasted the Mavericks_ 107-99. After some of his highlight plays_ Doncic would glance at the Dallas bench. The 25-year-old phenom torched his former squad Tuesday_ adding more salt to the wounds for Mavericks fans and proving GM Nico Harrison’s boneheaded Luka trade still looks like a disaster. Doncic dropped a triple-double on Dallas_ tallying 19 points_ 15 rebounds and 11 assists. This season_ he’s averaging 28.1 points per game_ which is a small step down from last year’s jaw-dropping 33.9 points per game. With the push-ups_ Doncic delivered a subtle jab at the leaked reports of Harrison trading him away for doubting the five-time All-NBA star’s motivation and fitness. Unless a miraculous turnaround occurs_ Dallas willingly fleeced themselves in the Luka Doncic trade. From the front office to the nosebleeds at American Airlines Center_ the Mavericks remain dazed by Harrison’s backroom deal_ quietly orchestrated with Lakers GM Rob Pelinka_ who was well on his way to being named one of the worst execs in Lakers history until the Doncic trade flipped that on its head. The Lakers are featuring a top-five player to complement LeBron James and receiving a huge bump in national sports discussion. Meanwhile_ Nico Harrison's Mavericks are waiting for an injured Anthony Davis to return_ hoping to justify the trade that landed AD_ a first-round pick and Max Christie for Luka. Since the deal_ Harrison has been persona non grata in Dallas. And the NBA is the biggest winner in this deal as Doncic works as a jolt of adrenaline for Old Man LeBron and a cornerstone who could bring back the Lakers' appeal for a decade.

Here's a larger hint: Another Simpsons clue with straight lines from the past with a price. Today's Connections answers So_ what are today's Connections answers for game #626? Drumroll_ please...  🟨 Expenditure: Charge_ cost_ price_ rate 🟩 Onetime: Former_ late_ past_ prior 🟦 Made with horizontal lines: Dash_ hyphen_ minus_ underscore 🟪 Simpson family members with first letter changed: Baggie_ barge_ comer_ pisa I try to start at purple on 2-rated puzzles but often overthink what ones they think are harder than the other. Anyway_ I started with past and prior which were for the green group and included former and late. I noted charge_ cost_ price and rate as "expenditures" so I held that one thinking it was the yellow group (it was). Instead_ I went with dash_ hyphen_ minus and underscore as straight line punctuation_ which I had thought was too obvious earlier. This left the purple category with the second Simpsons category in as many weeks. We had Simpson names with one letter changed; Baggie (Maggie)_ Barge (Marge)_ Comer (Homer)_ and Pisa (Lisa). Yesterday's Connections answers  🟨 Enthusiasm: Gust_ passion_ relish_ zest 🟩 "Many" in different languages: Beacoup_ molto_ mucho_ multi 🟦 Rectangular prisms: Brick_ fish tank_ microwave_ shoebox 🟪 Rhyme with U.S. coins: Jenny_ lime_ mortar_ pickle Reading this in a later time zone? Here are the Connections answers for game #625_ which had a difficulty rating of 4.5 out of 5_ according to the Connections Companion.  I do enjoy when I learn something thanks to a connections puzzle. Today_ I learned a different definition of prism than I was aware of thanks to the blue category. My main reference point is optical prisms involving transparent material cut specifically for analyzing light. However_ the geometric version is simply a shape with two opposite and equal parrallel planes. To be honest_ I was terrible at geometry in school instead preferring the lingual math of algebra. Anyway_ I got brick_ fish tank_ microwave and shoebox based on a simpler idea of rectangles. Moving on_ we picked up gusto_ passion_ relish and zest for the yellow enthusiasm. I had no clues for purple so I put in the green category next with beaucoup_ molto_ mucho and multi meaning many. Our purple group today involved U.S. currency rhymes; Jenny (penny)_ lime (dime)_ mortar (quarter)_ and pickle (nickle).

294849052,Gene Hackman_ a two-time Oscar-winning actor whose compelling gravitas and simple humanity made him an onscreen fixture for 40 years_ has died at 95.    The actor_ his wife_ Betsy Arakawa_ 68_ and their dog were found dead in their home in Santa Fe_ New Mexico_ on Feb. 26_ according to Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza. No cause of death was given_ however authorities confirmed there was no indication of foul play. Hackman and Arakawa had been married for 34 years.   After a career in which he played everyone from conflicted cops to inspirational basketball coaches to failed fathers to Lex Luthor_ Hackman quietly retired from acting after the 2004 comedy Welcome to Mooseport_ devoting his energies to writing novels and painting. Coming of age at the same time as other influential American actors like Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall_ the former Marine delivered his performances with a minimum of fuss_ creating characters who_ whether they were comedic or dramatic_ always exuded an air of lived-in realism. “I feel like when I’m actually doing the work_ I know what I’m doing and I feel good about most of the stuff that I do_” Hackman said in 2000. “But when I see it on the screen_ I have no idea if it’s good_ bad or indifferent. I can’t be objective. I leave it up to other people to tell me.”   Born on January 30_ 1930 in San Bernardino_ California_ Eugene Allen Hackman moved to Danville_ Illinois as a boy_ developing a love for James Cagney at a young age. “There was a kind of energy about him_ and he was totally different from anyone I’d ever seen in my life_” Hackman recalled of his idol in 2011. “Having been brought up in the Midwest_ I didn’t know those New York people. I thought he was terrific. Everything he did had a life to it. He was a bad guy in most of the films_ and yet there was something lovable about him and creative.”   After serving in the Marines for four years_ Hackman moved to New York_ eventually traveling to Southern California to pursue acting. It was at the Pasadena Playhouse where he met Hoffman_ the two aspiring thespians bonding over what seemed to be a shared destiny of limited career possibilities. “We were constantly told by acting teachers and casting directors that we were ‘character’ actors_” Hackman told Film Comment. “The world ‘character’ denotes something less than attractive. This was drummed into us. I accepted the limitation_ of always being the third or fourth guy down_ and my goals were tiny. But I still wanted to be an actor.”   Undeterred_ Hackman grabbed roles on television and in New York theater_ gaining acclaim for his appearance in the 1964 Broadway comedy Any Wednesday. Soon_ that success was parlayed into Hackman being cast in the film drama Lilith_ where he caught the eye of the movie’s star Warren Beatty. A few years later_ Beatty brought Hackman onboard his daring counterculture crime classic Bonnie and Clyde_ in which he played Clyde’s older brother Buck. The role landed the actor his first Oscar nomination_ for Best Supporting Actor_ and a film career soon followed.   Like many actors of his generation_ Hackman helped put a stamp on Hollywood’s creative renaissance of the 1970s. But unlike peers such as Jack Nicholson who embodied the era’s rebellious_ searching spirit_ Hackman often played men who tried to work within the system_ often discovering the futility of such a stance. He received his second Oscar nomination for 1970’s I Never Sang for My Father_ about a college professor confronting his overbearing father_ and the following year in The French Connection he played Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle_ a hard-nosed_ bigoted New York detective who’s ruthlessly efficient at his job. The French Connection won Best Picture_ and Hackman walked away with the Best Actor trophy_ even though during filming he despaired that he was wrong for the role and considered quitting. “I’m not that kind of guy_” Hackman told Roger Ebert shortly after The French Connection opened. “He was a physical man. No second thoughts. No introspection. We had to go back and reshoot the first two days of scenes because I hadn’t gotten into the character enough. I wasn’t physical enough.”   Hackman continued to essay iconic roles throughout the decade – including that of the doomed surveillance expert Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 paranoid thriller The Conversation – but this character actor also branched out into big studio productions like the celebrated disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure. As the ‘70s came to a close_ he portrayed the infamous Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II_ setting the template for sophisticated_ haughty villains that have become commonplace in comic-book films.   Despite being a movie star_ Hackman never fully shed the tireless work ethic of an actor who just wants to dive into the next piece of material. His career was really made up of two parallel strands. On one side_ he pursued engaging roles that fed his artistic temperament_ such as in Reds (which was directed by his old friend Warren Beatty)_ Mississippi Burning and Another Woman. On the other_ he became a reliable presence in studio films_ adding a touch of class to Tony Scott thrillers such as Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State. At the same time_ Hackman also demonstrated how art and commerce could mix_ earning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for playing the corrupt local sheriff Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood’s 1992 revisionist Western Unforgiven. But as with The French Connection_ Hackman had his doubts about being right for the role. “I swore I would never be involved in a picture with this much violence in it_” he once said. “But the more I read it and the more I came to understand the purpose of the film_ the more fascinated I became.”   Although he was expert at conveying the darker side of humanity_ he could also be counted on for a light touch. For many fans of inspirational sports movies_ Hoosiers is an all-time great_ Hackman ably portraying the scrappy_ tough-love coach Norman Dale who guides his team of underdogs to the title. And his role as the frustratingly flaky patriarch of Wes Anderson’s 2001 comedy The Royal Tenenbaums introduced the respected actor’s-actor to a new generation of filmgoers. Hackman’s notorious perfectionism and no-bullshit demeanor were apparently fully on display during the filming of Tenenbaums–legend has it that the actor called Anderson a “cunt” on set and instructed him to “pull up your pants and act like a man”–but the director remained awed by Hackman’s portrayal of the complicated Royal Tenenbaum. “He was one of the things that pulled everybody into this movie_” Anderson said in 2011 during a 10th anniversary screening that Hackman did not attend. “Anytime we are together and talk about the movie_ we always talk about him. He’s a huge force and I really enjoyed working with him. Even though he was very challenging with me_ it was very exciting seeing him launch into these scenes.”   In his late 70s_ Hackman retired from acting_ explaining simply_ “I feel comfortable with what I’ve done.” He pursued other interests_ including writing historical fiction_ saying in 2014_ “In a sort of way_ [writing] is liberating because you don’t have a director right there at your elbow giving you a little nudge now and then or telling you how he thinks you should pronounce a certain word or emphasize a certain phrase.” He later added_ “I know that I’ll never be … as successful as I was as an actor_ but in some ways it’s maybe more creative.”   He ended his acting career with five Oscar nominations_ three Golden Globes (as well as a Cecil B. DeMille Award)_ and two BAFTA awards. When a GQ writer asked him in 2011 if he’d ever consider going back to film_ Hackman responded_ “I don’t know. If I could do it in my own house_ maybe_ without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.” But he sounded fully content with his new artistic endeavors and the body of film work he had left behind.   “You go through stages in your career that you feel very good about yourself_” he said. “Then you feel awful_ like_ Why didn’t I choose something else? But overall I’m pretty satisfied that I made the right choice when I decided to be an actor. I was lucky to find a few things that I could do well as an actor and that I could look at and say_ ‘Yeah_ that’s all right.’”
294914098,Gene Hackman_ the prolific Oscar-winning actor whose studied portraits ranged from reluctant heroes to conniving villains and included what is considered one of the greatest sports movies of all time in "Hoosiers_" has died at the age of 95.  Hackman was found dead with his wife_ Betsy Arakawa_ and their dog when deputies performed a welfare check at their New Mexico home around 1:45 p.m. Thursday_ Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Denise Avila said.  Foul play was not suspected_ but authorities did not release circumstances of their deaths and said an investigation was ongoing.  Loosely based on an Indiana high school basketball team in the 1950s_ the 1986 film "Hoosiers" features Hackman starring as coach Norman Dale_ a man who was given a second chance at coaching after his first one ended for striking one of his players years earlier. Hackman leads the small-school Hickory Huskers on an unlikely run through the Indiana high school basketball tournament_ winning the title over big-city South Bend Central on a buzzer beater by Jimmy Chitwood.  Hackman famously thought the movie would end his career_ but the film instead was widely lauded. It was voted as the best sports movie of all time by The Associated Press in 2020 and is the No. 4 sports film according to the American Film Institute.  Hackman was a frequent and versatile presence on screen from the 1960s until his retirement. His dozens of films included Academy Award favorites "The French Connection" and "Unforgiven_" a breakout performance in "Bonnie and Clyde_" a classic bit of farce in "Young Frankenstein_" a turn as the comic book villain Lex Luthor in "Superman_" and the title character in Wes Anderson's 2001 "The Royal Tenenbaums."  He was a five-time Oscar nominee_ and his wins for "The French Connection" and "Unforgiven" came 21 years apart. His death comes just four days before this year's Academy Awards ceremony.  Although self-effacing and unfashionable_ Hackman held special status within Hollywood. He embodied the ethos of doing his job_ doing it well and letting others worry about his image. Beyond the obligatory appearances at awards ceremonies_ he was rarely seen on the social circuit and made no secret of his disdain for the business side of show business.  He was an early retiree -- essentially done_ by choice_ with movies by his mid-70s -- and a late bloomer. Hackman was 35 when cast for "Bonnie and Clyde" and past 40 when he won his first Oscar.  When not on film locations_ Hackman enjoyed painting_ stunt flying_ stock car racing and deep sea diving. In his later years_ he wrote novels and lived on his ranch in Santa Fe_ New Mexico_ on a hilltop looking out on the Colorado Rockies_ a view he preferred to his films that popped up on television.  "I'll watch maybe five minutes of it_" he once told Time magazine_ "and I'll get this icky feeling_ and I turn the channel."  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

294751382,The Justice Department in an emergency filing contended that the administration needs more time to review outstanding payments for fraud and abuse and warned that complying with the rushed timeline could lead to irreversible financial harm.  “The order does not limit its abrupt deadline to respondents’ own invoices or letters of credit_ instead apparently compelling the government to pay requests from any organization that has asked for such funds_” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote.  The dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by aid groups and contractors challenging Trump’s executive order that froze foreign aid disbursements for a 90-day review. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali_ an appointee of President Donald Trump’s predecessor_ Joe Biden_ had previously ruled that the freeze was unlawful and issued a temporary restraining order in February requiring the government to lift it. However_ the plaintiffs claim they still have not been paid.  On Tuesday_ Ali issued a new ruling giving the administration until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday to release the funds_ criticizing officials for failing to comply with his prior order. During a hearing_ government lawyer Indraneel Sur was unable to specify any steps taken to process the payments.  The new ruling marked the third time Ali had ordered the administration to release foreign aid funds that were frozen after Trump ordered a 90-pause on all foreign aid. Trump’s request came as the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia refused to halt the midnight deadline Wednesday evening.  The Trump administration has “not shown that the enforcement orders disrupt the status quo by requiring them to do anything more than they would have had to do absent the temporarily restrained agency actions_ which are the subject of ongoing preliminary injunction briefing_” according to the three-judge panel’s decision.  JUDGE SAYS TRUMP HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH RULING ON SUSPENSION OF FOREIGN AID   Plaintiffs in the case say Trump’s sweeping aid freeze_ including the stop-work orders halting U.S. Agency for International Development around the world_ have thrown global humanitarian relief efforts into disarray.  But the administration argues that the order’s sweeping nature_ covering all foreign aid recipients_ improperly limits the president’s discretion and circumvents standard review processes.

294840894,Actor Gene Hackman and his wife_ Betsy Arakawa_ have been found dead in their Santa Fe_ New Mexico home_ police said.  Santa Fe County police discovered the lifeless bodies of the two-time Oscar winner_ 95_ and the classical pianist_ 63_ on Wednesday.  The couple_ who had been married since 1991_ were found dead alongside their dog.  Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza confirmed the news to the Santa Fe New Mexican on Thursday_ saying no foul play is suspected.  Mendoza added that there is no official cause of death at this time.  The iconic actor_ best known for his roles in “The French Connection_” “Bonnie and Clyde” and “The Royal Tenenbaums_” had celebrated his 95th birthday last month.  While he was known to shy away from the spotlight in recent years_ Hackman had actually quit acting back in 2004. His last project was “Welcome to Mooseport.”  He and his wife subsequently traded their Los Angeles home for a new spot in New Mexico_ where they had resided ever since.  Hackman is survived by three children_ Christopher_ Elizabeth Jean and Leslie Anne_ with his late ex-wife_ Faye Maltese.  This is a developing story. Please check pack for updates.
294839578,On Thursday at 2:53 a.m. EST the National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch valid from Friday 1 a.m. EST until Saturday 1 a.m. EST for Keweenaw County.  The weather service comments_ “Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations between 6 and 9 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph.”  “Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening commutes. Gusty winds could bring down tree branches_” says the weather service. “Monitor the latest forecasts for updates on this situation.”
294735462,A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season's flu shot has been canceled_ a panel member said Wednesday. Federal health officials notified members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the cancelation in an email Wednesday afternoon_ said committee member Dr. Paul Offit_ the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The email_ Offit said_ offered no explanation for the scrapped meeting. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services_ which oversees the FDA_ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The cancelation comes as the United States is in the midst of a particularly severe flu season. So far_ there have been 86 deaths in children and 19_000 deaths in adults this season_ according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA typically convenes the meeting every spring to get recommendations on which strains should be included in the upcoming flu vaccine. The meetings are important because the flu virus changes year to year_ and the vaccine must be updated to provide the best protection. Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall. For the 2024-2025 flu season_ drugmakers supplied the U.S. with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots_ according to the CDC. It's unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for Americans who want to get a flu vaccine next season. On Friday_ a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA's strain selection. In January_ President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to stop communicating with the WHO. Stat News reported on Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting_ however. The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed. That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines_ including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine_ as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved at-home nasal spray for influenza. The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr_ an anti-vaccine activist_ could undermine the vaccine regulatory process in the U.S._ possibly leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases. Earlier Wednesday_ Texas health officials reported that an unvaccinated child in the state died from the measles_ the first death from the virus in a decade. An outbreak in the state has led to at least 124 cases_ mostly in children. "It's a bad day for infectious diseases_" said Dr. Ofer Levy_ director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children's Hospital who has advised the FDA on vaccines.
294907520,To capture Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds you need to use a trap. Depending on the monster_ either a pitfall trap or shock trap will work_ but that won't be enough on its own - you'll also need a way to put the monster to sleep with some kind of tranquillizer weapon_ and even then there's no guarantees. Ultimately capturing monsters alive in MH Rise is more art than science_ and something the game doesn't even tell you is an option until after the campaign is done_ but it's still worth learning and putting into practice even before that point_ so you can capture creatures and get the special rewards.  How to use traps to capture monsters in MH Wilds  To capture a monster alive with a trap in MH Wilds_ you need to do the following:  Lower the monster's health significantly with any of the Monster Hunter Wilds weapons_ to the point where NPC followers will shout "nearly there" or similar phrases (about 10% of the monster's max health).Deploy either a Pitfall Trap or Shock Trap.Once the trap is ready_ lure the monster to stand on it and trigger it.While the monster is stuck in the trap_ quickly run over and use a Tranq Bomb or other sleep-inducing device.If the monster's health is low enough_ it should fall asleep in the trap. This will instantly register it as captured. If it's the last target of the hunt_ the mission will immediately end (and no_ you can't carve it while it's alive).  Obviously there are a few things to keep in mind here_ most importantly being that some monsters cannot be trapped_ like Jin Dahaad (largely because they're too_ well_ large). We include info on which monsters can and can't be captured in our page on the Monster Hunter Wilds weaknesses of every monster in the game!  You can tell which monsters you can and can't capture by the phrasing of the mission objective: if it says to HUNT the monster_ you can capture it. If it says to SLAY the monster_ you can't. Also_ though it doesn't tutorialize the way in which you capture monsters until the endgame_ you can capture monsters before that point.  If you're struggling_ here are some tips for capturing monsters in MH Wilds as a rule.  Some monsters are immune to either the Pitfall Trap or Shock Trap. If it's immune to one_ you'll need to use the other. Make sure you have both on you_ or check their resistances in the field manual.There're various ways to put monsters to sleep_ and all of them work_ but the Tranq Bomb is the most reliable and easy to use_ as well as working for every build and character type. You can also fire Sleep ammo from weapons like the Monster Hunter Wilds Heavy Bowgun.To get the monster to stand on the trap_ a Luring Pod or other device will help_ though most times you can just put it in its rampaging path.If the monster leaves the area without standing on the trap_ make sure you retrieve it before you move on.You may need to use more than one Tranq Bomb to knock out the monster.The dialogue from allies to mark a weakened monster is only one way to tell they're close - they'll also limp more frequently_ a visual indicator of low health. This sign isn't a guarantee_ but it does bode well. Some monsters will also return to their nest when at low health (such as the Rathian in the Scarlet Forest returning to a treetop full of Wyvern eggs).  Should you kill or capture monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds?  Capturing and killing monsters in Monster Hunter each change the percentage of drops for each monster - so depending on whether you kill or capture them_ certain drops will be more or less common_ or may not even be possible at all. The numbers vary depending on the monster_ but the ultimate reality is this: capturing generally offers a better chance at rare items_ though it varies from monster to monster_ so for the best odds you should work your way through the Monster Hunter Wilds monster List we've laid out and try to slay and capture every one at least once. Again_ the Field Guide will show the percentages involved on drops_ so you can make an educated choice.  © GamesRadar+. Not to be reproduced without permission
295137844,It can be hard knowing where to start with Monster Hunter Wilds. Though undoubtedly streamlined in comparison to previous installments_ this is still a Monster Hunter game_ which means all sorts of systems to contend with. Even for series veterans_ a good number of mechanics no longer work the same way_ so no matter who you are there's stuff to learn.  Monster Hunter can be especially brutal for those who've never tried it before_ so here I'll do my best to lay out some early priorities. These will help you get started hunting but also come to grasp a lot of the systems you'll be expected to interact with on your path to becoming a veteran hunter.  Check your weapon's controls guide and head to the training area  Whether you're an experienced weapon main or are picking one up for the first time_ it's well worth checking out the in-game controls guide for your weapon. To find this:  Open the in-game menuCycle across to the Info section—three tabs alongSelect Play Guide at the bottomChoose the Weapon Controls option third down  This useful source of info will lay out all weapon attacks and combos and also gives a little explanation of important terms on the second page that will help you understand how the weapon works. Since there are new weapon attacks in Wilds_ even if you knew your stuff in World and Rise_ you should definitely take some time to see what's changed.  If you want to experiment_ you can also head to the Training Area in the Windward Plains Base Camp. This unlocks as part of the story_ but it'll give you a place to work on your combos and get them straight in your head_ in case you don't want to do that while fighting actual monsters.  Pick up your pre-order DLC and beta rewards from the Support Palico  Once the Windward Plains Base Camp is operational_ you'll be able to speak to the Support Desk Palico_ Conut_ and collect your beta reward items if you played. Simply interact with them and choose the Claim Content option for a list of your rewards. This is the same for any pre-order DLC. Unless you buy a lot of DLC_ this is likely one of the few times you'll talk to Conut_ but remember that you can also manage your Pop-up Camps here once that mechanic unlocks_ so it might be worth checking back then.  Collect rations from the Ingredient Centre and cook yourself some steaks  Another feature of the Windward Plains Base Camp that unlocks once it's up and running is the Ingredient Centre. Sadly_ Felynes will no longer cook for you in Wilds_ but they still provide you with plenty of ingredients so you can make food yourself. Speak to Tom at the Ingredient Center and he'll give you a regular shipment of rations you can consume or cook into pre-hunt meals in your tent_ or using the Portable BBQ Grill.  It's also worth grabbing some raw meat—your best bet is by hunting the Ceratonoth and Dalthydon small monsters you'll find on the plains just outside camp. Once you have raw meat_ you can equip your Portable BBQ Grill by cycling along your item bar at the bottom and cook some steaks—remember to time your input during the cooking minigame if you want Well Done Steaks.  These hunks of meat are a little different from rations and will increase your health and stamina when the duration of your previous meal has expired_ so it's good to have a few on hand in case of a rumbly tummy emergency.  Slay small monsters and get the Bulaqchi Specs  When I get to a new region in Monster Hunter_ the first thing I do is hunt and harvest every small monster in the area. Why? They're easy to forget about_ but they often have their own unique armour sets and provide materials and skills you can't get elsewhere. In the Windward Plains_ you should hunt down Talioth to unlock the Talioth Bracers_ Vespoid for the Vespoid set_ and finally_ Bulaqchi for the Bulaqchi Specs. You can see which monsters are which by hovering over the small pink icons on the map.  The Bulaqchi is especially useful to hunt since the specs give you the Entomologist skill that stops small insect monsters being destroyed when you attack_ allowing you to carve them. I consider it a must-have skill if you're hunting Vespoids for materials or farming Nerscylla Hatchlings for Monster Fluid_ so don't neglect it.  Grab Wiggly Litchi and build yourself a material stockpile  There's lots of useful endemic life to grab in Wilds—by which I mean small creatures that give you something when you snatch them with your hookclaw. Vigorwasps restore health_ Purewasps remove status effects_ Heatmantle Bugs warm you in cold areas_ and Coldmantle Bugs cool you in hot areas. There are all sorts to mess around with_ but the one that is universally beneficial is the Wiggly Litchi.  This white worm buffs your stamina regen_ which is never not useful during a hunt. Basically grab this little creature whenever you spot it nestled on a wall. While we're on the subject of grabbing_ you should also grab…well_ just about everything. Since you can use your Hook Slinger to yoink stuff while your Seikret is auto-travelling_ it's worth building a stockpile of crafting items.  Materials like honey_ herbs_ and blue mushrooms are never not useful_ and special items give you guild points_ which you can use later to change time in your tent_ or buy items and weapons from the Support Ship once in high rank. Also make sure to turn on auto-craft in your crafting menu for any vital items like mega potions_ potions_ and antidotes.  Get in the habit of checking the Monster Field Guide  This is another mechanic you'll be introduced to via the main story and will likely forget almost immediately after. Word to the wise: don't. This is the single most useful tool in all of Monster Hunter and yet people seem to forget it exists constantly. The Monster Field Guide tells you:  Each monster's precise weaknesses_ whether elemental or status effectWhere best to attack with your weapon based on damage type_ i.e slashing_ bludgeoning_ shotHow to get every single material the monster drops as well as % chances  It's such a handy resource and one you should remember exists when you can't work out where to get a monster material_ or you're struggling to beat one in battle.  Start using the Ghillie Mantle  As you progress through Wilds_ Gemma the smithy will periodically give you new mantles to use—effectively capes you can temporarily equip for a special buff. The first one you'll get is the Ghillie Mantle_ which lets you sneak around. It's easy to forget about these since they represent an extra layer you don't really have to engage with when hunting.  Still_ if you want an advantage in early hunts_ and a boon in later ones_ I'd recommend experimenting with the Ghillie Mantle. If you hold the left bumper on controller and press down on the D-pad_ you can use your right stick to select the Ghillie Mantle from the bottom of the Essential Items hotwheel. Now simply walk up behind a monster before you start a hunt and interact where it says Sneak Attack for some big extra damage.
295344346,President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order making English the official language of the United States_ three White House officials told CNBC on Friday.  The order would establish a national language for the first time in U.S. history.  Trump's order would also rescind former President Bill Clinton's August 2000 directive requiring agencies and other recipients of federal funds to provide services for those with limited English proficiency_ according to a fact sheet shared with CNBC.  Trump's designation will allow federal agencies to maintain their current policies and continue to provide documents and services in other languages. But it "encourages new Americans to adopt a national language that opens doors to greater opportunities_" according to the fact sheet.   The Wall Street Journal first reported the order earlier Friday morning.  This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.

295109804,SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful_ granting some temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration's massive trimming of the federal workforce.  U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees_ including the Department of Defense.  "OPM does not have any authority whatsoever_ under any statute in the history of the universe_" to hire or fire any employees but its own_ he said.  Alsup handed down the order on a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions and nonprofits in a lawsuit filed by the coalition filed last week.  The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration's efforts to vastly shrink the federal workforce_ which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.  The plaintiffs say the Office of Personnel Management had no authority to terminate the jobs of probationary workers who generally have less than a year on the job. They also say the firings were predicated on a lie of poor performance by the workers.  Lawyers for the government say the Office of Personnel Management did not direct the firings_ but asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.  There are an estimated 200_000 probationary workers - generally employees who have less than a year on the job - across federal agencies. About 15_000 are employed in California_ providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans' care_ the complaint says.  Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges in similar lawsuits attempting to stop the Trump administration's goal of vastly reducing the federal workforce.  Alsup_ who was appointed by President Bill Clinton_ a Democrat_ has presided over many high-profile cases and is known for his blunt talk. He oversaw the criminal probation of Pacific Gas & Electric and has called the nation's largest utility a " continuing menace to California."

295436306,For two years_ Joseph Czuba_ had a friendly relationship with his Palestinian American tenants in Plainfield_ Illinois. But after the war on Gaza ignited_ a switch flipped.  Days after October 7_ 2023_ Czuba told his tenant Hanan Shaheen that she needed to move out_ citing the war_ and insinuated she was dangerous_ Czuba’s ex-wife testified. On the morning of October 14_ Shaheen later told investigators that Czuba said he was angry at her for what was happening in Jerusalem. “Let’s pray for peace_” Shaheen responded.  That day_ Czuba attacked her and her 6-year-old son with a knife_ saying “You_ as a Muslim_ must die_” Shaheen recalled in testimony this week. Stabbed more than a dozen times_ Shaheen escaped to the bathroom and called 911. Czuba then attacked her son_ Wadee Alfayoumi_ stabbing him 26 times across his body. Alfayoumi did not survive.   An Illinois jury on Friday convicted Czuba_ 73_ of first-degree murder_ attempted murder_ aggravated battery_ and hate crimes_ bringing to a close one of the most shocking hate crime trials to shake the nation after the war on Gaza broke out. He faces up to life in prison.  Czuba’s hateful comments about Palestinians and Muslims took center stage in the trial this week at Will County Courthouse_ about 45 miles southwest of Chicago. It included testimony from about 20 witnesses_ police footage_ and 911 call recordings.   Hate crimes are notoriously difficult to prosecute_ but experts say damning evidence of both the killing and the motive in this case likely paved the way for a guilty verdict.   Jeannine Bell_ a law and social justice professor at Loyola University Chicago_ said there is “abundant evidence” of Czuba’s motivation based on the gruesome nature of the assault and his comments expressing anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia.   In the final stretch of the trial Thursday_ prosecutors played a clip of Czuba’s comments about Arabs and Muslims after the stabbing.   “I can’t believe all the protests of people that are supporting PLO_” Czuba said in a video from the back of a patrol car_ referring to the Palestine Liberation Organization. “It’s so evil.”   “They are just like infested rats_” he said.  Czuba said that he was afraid for his life and for his wife. He said he was trying to help Shaheen out_ and that she couldn’t afford a house. “Didn’t tell me she is a Muslim.”  Czuba said he “begged” Shaheen to “get out for three days_” and she wouldn’t leave. At one point_ he said she was a “trained fighter.” “Let me tell you she was a problem.”  Czuba’s attorney_ George Lenard_ attempted to poke holes in the prosecutions and the police investigation_ and argued that just because his client dislikes the PLO does not mean he is hateful.   Abed Ayoub_ director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee who has been involved in civil rights advocacy for about two decades_ says the common thread in hate-fueled instances is ignorance_ and attackers are often people who are easily “radicalized.”   “We need to pay attention in this country to what is driving these …individuals to do this_ to commit these crimes_ and it’s no secret. It’s the hate rhetoric itself_” Ayoub said.  In Czuba’s case_ prosecutors said he had shown a deep interest in the war abroad and had been listening to conservative talk radio.  Ayoub noted he has also seen a rise in anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia from media and politicians across the spectrum since the war on Gaza began.  “Now we’re seeing it in the open_” he said.   The Council on American-Islamic Relations_ a nonprofit civil rights organization_ tracked a dramatic rise in complaints in wake of Israel’s assault on Gaza. The organization said it documented 8_061 complaints in 2023 — nearly half of which were from the last three months — the highest tally CAIR has recorded since its founding in 1994.   Bell_ of Loyola University_ noted similar spikes in hate crimes at two points since the turn of the century: after the September 11_ 2001_ terror attacks_ and during the first election of President Donald Trump.  The trial comes amid an attack on civil rights legislation. Trump effectively ordered a freeze on the Justice Department’s current civil rights prosecution and banning new cases. If the order remains in place_ one expert says people will have to rely on a patchwork of state laws in hate crime cases.  “That means that we cannot rely on the federal government to prosecute hate crimes_ and so states are going to have to do it for there to be meaningful prosecution of hate crimes_” said Richard Wilson_ a law and anthropology professor at the University of Connecticut.  Most cases are tried in state court_ and hate crime laws vary significantly across the U.S. Removing federal litigation could have major consequences_ especially in jurisdictions with weak protections_ Wilson said. Washington state and New York_ for instance_ have a rigorous prosecution record; South Carolina and Wyoming do not_ he said.  “Our hate crimes law enforcement system simply is dysfunctional_ or non-functional_ and has-been_” Wilson said.   While convictions like Czuba’s show the importance of state law_ the federal retreat poses a major problem. “The conclusion has to be that we tolerate hate crimes_” Wilson said.

295250452,OMAHA_ Neb. – Egg producers blame the bird flu outbreak for driving prices to record highs_ but critics believe giant companies are taking advantage of their market dominance to profit handsomely at the expense of budget-conscious egg buyers.  Advocacy groups_ Democratic lawmakers and a Federal Trade Commission member are calling for a government investigation after egg prices spiked to a record average of $4.95 per dozen this month. The Trump administration did unveil a plan this week to combat bird flu_ but how much that might ease egg prices — a key driver of inflation — remains to be seen.  “Donald Trump promised to lower food prices on ‘Day One’_ but with egg prices skyrocketing out of control_ he fired the workers charged with containing bird flu. Working families need relief now_” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a statement.  What’s behind the record egg prices?  The industry_ and most experts_ squarely blame bird flu. More than 166 million birds have been slaughtered to contain the virus. Some 30 million egg layers have been wiped out just since January_ significantly disrupting egg supplies. The Department of Agriculture’s longstanding policy has been to kill entire flocks anytime the virus is found on a farm.  As a result_ the number of egg layers has dropped nationwide by about 12% from before the outbreak to 292 million birds_ according to a Feb. 1 USDA estimate_ but another 11 million egg layers have been killed since then_ so it’s likely worse. When prices spiked to $4.82 two years ago and prompted initial calls for price gouging probes_ the flock was above 300 million.  “This has nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. And I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality_” American Egg Board President Emily Metz said.  “Our farmers are in the fight of their lives_ period_ full stop. And they’re doing everything they can to keep these birds safe_” Metz said. “This is a supply challenge. Due to bird flu. Nothing else.”  Farm Action suspects monopolistic behavior. The group that lobbies on behalf of smaller farmers_ consumers and rural communities notes that egg production is only down about 4% from last year and some 7.57 billion table eggs were produced last month_ yet some consumers are still finding egg shelves empty at their local grocery stores.  “Dominant egg corporations are blaming avian flu for the price hikes that we’re seeing. But while the egg supply has fallen only slightly_ these companies profits have soared_” said Angela Huffman_ Farm Action’s president. The Justice Department acknowledged receiving the group’s letter calling for an investigation but declined to comment on it.  The fact that a jury ruled in 2023 that major egg producers used various means to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s only adds to the doubts about their motives now.  What do the numbers show?  Retail egg prices had generally remained below $2 per dozen for years before this outbreak began. Prices have more than doubled since then_ boosting profits for egg producers even as they deal with soaring costs.  Most of the dominant producers are privately held companies and don’t release their results. But the biggest_ Cal-Maine Foods_ which supplies about 20% of the nation’s eggs_ is public_ and its profits increased dramatically. Cal-Maine reported a $219 million profit in the most recent quarter when its eggs sold for an average of $2.74 per dozen_ up from just $1.2 million in the quarter just before this outbreak began in early 2022 when its eggs were selling for $1.37 per dozen.  Sherman Miller_ Cal-Maine’s president and CEO_ said in reporting the numbers that higher market prices “have continued to rise this fiscal year as supply levels of shell eggs have been restricted due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.”  But he said Cal-Maine also sold significantly more eggs — some 330 million dozens_ up from 288 million the year before — in the quarter because demand is so strong and Cal-Maine has made a number of acquisitions. Cal-Maine also suffered few outbreaks on its farms_ outside of a couple facilities in Kansas and Texas. The Mississippi-based company didn’t respond to calls from The Associated Press.  What about production costs?  Economists and analysts say the record egg prices aren’t a sure sign of something nefarious_ and short-term profits might only last until farms get hit. Once a flock is slaughtered_ it can take as long as a year to clean a farm and raise new birds to egg-laying age. The USDA pays farmers for every bird killed_ but it doesn’t cover all the costs for farmers as they go without income.  “The consumer_ I think_ will probably feel like they’re getting the rough end of the stick. But I guarantee you_ the farmers that are having to depopulate the barns_ they’re having a rougher time_” CoBank analyst Brian Earnest said.  Inflation in the costs of feed and fuel and labor have contributed to rising egg prices_ and farmers have been investing in biosecurity measures to help keep the virus away. So production costs also appear to be at an all-time high_ according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ producer price index.  “This isn’t a case where they’re taking the price up to gouge the market. It is the price is going up through auction at wholesale. And they’re benefiting from higher prices because supplies are tight_” University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said.
295674964,NEW YORK -- David Johansen_ the wiry_ gravelly-voiced singer and last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls who later performed as his campy_ pompadoured alter ego_ Buster Poindexter_ has died. He was 75.  Johansen died Friday at his home in New York City_ according to Rolling Stone_ citing a family spokesperson. It was revealed in early 2025 that he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumor.  The New York Dolls were forerunners of punk and the band's style - teased hair_ women's clothes and lots of makeup - inspired the glam movement that took up residence in heavy metal a decade later in bands like Faster Pussycat and Mötley Crüe.  "When you're an artist_ the main thing you want to do is inspire people_ so if you succeed in doing that_ it's pretty gratifying_" Johansen told The Knoxville News-Sentinel in 2011.  Rolling Stone once called the Dolls "the mutant children of the hydrogen age" and Vogue called them the "darlings of downtown style_ tarted-up toughs in boas and heels."  "The New York Dolls were more than musicians; they were a phenomenon. They drew on old rock 'n' roll_ big-city blues_ show tunes_ the Rolling Stones and girl groups_ and that was just for starters_" Bill Bentley wrote in "Smithsonian Rock and Roll: Live and Unseen."  The band never found commercial success and was torn by internal strife and drug addictions_ breaking up after two albums by the middle of the decade. In 2004_ former Smiths frontman and Dolls admirer Morrissey convinced Johansen and other surviving members to regroup for the Meltdown Festival in England_ leading to three more studio albums.  In the '80s_ Johansen assumed the persona of Buster Poindexter_ a pompadour-styled lounge lizard who had a hit with the kitschy party single "Hot_ Hot_ Hot" in 1987. He also appeared in such movies as "Candy Mountain_" "Let It Ride_" "Married to the Mob" and had a memorable turn as the Ghost of Christmas Past in Bill Murray-led hit "Scrooged."  Johansen was in 2023 the subject of Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi's documentary "Personality Crisis: One Night Only_" which mixed footage of his two-night stand at the Café Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through his wildly varied career and intimate interviews.  "I used to think about my voice like: 'What's it gonna sound like? What's it going to be when I do this song?' And I'd get myself into a knot about it_" Johansen told The Associated Press in 2023. "At some point in my life_ I decided: 'Just sing the (expletive) song. With whatever you got.' To me_ I go on stage and whatever mood I'm in_ I just claw my way out of it_ essentially."  David Roger Johansen was born to a large_ working class Catholic family on Staten Island_ his father an insurance salesman. He filled notebooks with poems and lyrics as a young man and liked a lot of different music - R&B_ Cuban_ Janis Joplin and Otis Redding.  The Dolls - the final original lineup included guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders_ bassist Arthur Kane and drummer Jerry Nolan - rubbed shoulders with Lou Reed and Andy Warhol in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the early 1970s.  They took their name from a toy hospital in Manhattan and were expected to take over the throne vacated by the Velvet Underground in the early 1970s. But neither of their first two albums - 1973's "New York Dolls_" produced by Todd Rundgren_ nor "Too Much Too Soon" a year later produced by Shadow Morton - charted.  "They're definitely a band to keep both eyes and ears on_" read the review of their debut album in Rolling Stone_ complementary of their "strange combination of high pop-star drag and ruthless street arrogance."  Their songs included "Personality Crisis" ("You got it while it was hot/But now frustration and heartache is what you got")_ "Looking for a Kiss" (I need a fix and a kiss") and a "Frankenstein" (Is it a crime/For you to fall in love with Frankenstein?")  Their glammed look was meant to embrace fans with a nonjudgmental_ noncategorical space. "I just wanted to be very welcoming_" Johansen said in the documentary_ "'cause the way this society is_ it was set up very strict - straight_ gay_ vegetarian_ whatever... I just kind of wanted to kind of like bring those walls down_ have a party kind of thing."  Rolling Stone_ reviewing their second album_ called them "the best hard-rock band in America right now" and called Johansen a "talented showman_ with an amazing ability to bring characters to life as a lyricist."  Decades later_ the Dolls' influence would be cherished. Rolling Stone would list their self-titled debut album at No. 301 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time_ writing "it's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them."  Blondie's Chris Stein in the Nolan biography "Stranded in the Jungle" wrote that the Dolls were "opening a door for the rest of us to walk through." Tommy Lee of Motley Crue called them early inspirations.  "Johansen is one of those singers_ to be a little paradoxical_ who is technically better and more versatile than he sounds_" said the Los Angeles Times in 2023. "His voice has always been a bit of a foghorn - higher or lower according to age_ habits and the song at hand - but it has a rare emotional urgency.  The Dolls_ representing rock at it's most debauched_ were divisive. In 1973_ they won the Creem magazine poll categories as the year's best and worst new group. They were nominated several times for The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but never got in.  "Dirty angels with painted faces_ the Dolls opened the box usually reserved for Pandora and unleashed the infant furies that would grow to become Punk_" wrote Nina Antonia in the book "Too Much_ Too Soon." "As if this legacy wasn't enough for one band_ they also trashed sexual boundaries_ savaged glitter and set new standards for rock 'n' roll excess."  By the end of their first run_ the Dolls were being managed by legendary promoter Malcolm McLaren_ who would later introduce the Sex Pistols to the Dolls' music. Culture critic Greil Marcus in "Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century" writes the Dolls played him some of their music and he couldn't believe how bad they were.  "The fact that they were so bad suddenly hit me with such force that I began to realize_ ''I'm laughing_ I'm talking to these guys_ I'm looking at them_ and I'm laughing with them; and I was suddenly impressed by the fact that I was no longer concerned with whether you could play well_" McLaren said. "The Dolls really impressed upon me that there was something else. There was something wonderful. I thought how brilliant they were to be this bad."  After the first demise of the Dolls_ Johansen started his own group_ the David Johansen band_ before reinventing himself yet again in the 1980s as Buster Poindexter.  Inspired by his passion for the blues and arcane American folk music Johansen also formed the group The Harry Smiths_ and toured the world performing the songs of Howlin' Wolf with Hubert Sumlin and Levon Helm. He also hosted the weekly radio show "The Mansion of Fun" on Sirius XM and painted.  He is survived by his wife_ Mara Hennessey_ and a stepdaughter_ Leah Hennessey.

Twas yellow. I made up for it by snagging purple as I saw drugstore and thought cowboy. Midnight cowboy and rhinestone cowboy followed soon after. For some reason I wasn't seeing the word space so that took a moment to find. Fiddler and Sunset leapt out to me as parts of musicals for the true blue category. Phantom (of the Opera) was an easy find from there. I wouldn't describe myself as a musicals fan so was not familiar with Merrily which I think refers to Merrily We Roll Along_ a musical that originated in 1981 by George Furth and Stephen Sondheim. Looking it up_ Merrily may be familiar thanks to its recent Broadway revival that starred Jonathan Groff_ Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and received several Tony awards. It got Groff his first Tony win_ something I was surprised to learn hadn't already happened. Oh yes_ and we wrapped up with green and the baffling to-bo- compound words. Tollbooth_ tomboy_ toolbox_ towboat_ which admittedly felt way too obvious once I initially saw it. Yesterday's Connections answers  🟨 Be indecisive: Hesitate_ waffle_ waver_ yo-yo 🟩 Lovely person: Angel_ dear_ doll_ peach 🟦 Lucidity: Marbles_ mind_ sense_ wits 🟪 Components of metaphors for things that can't be undone: Bell_ egg_ genie_ toothpaste Reading this in a later time zone? Here are the Connections answers for game #628_ which had a difficulty rating of 2.8 out of 5_ according to the Connections Companion.  With the two-rated puzzles_ I like to try going down the line and I blew that up with my first go when I picked dear_ doll_ angel and peach_ the green group. In my mind the connection was an overly familiar old man talking to a waitress at the dinner. Marbles_ to me_ immediately means mind. So_ sense_ wits and mind were quick grabs. And in the latest in absurdly long category titles just this week_ I nabbed the purple group next for things that can't be undone like ringing a bell_ cracking an egg_ putting toothpaste in the tube or putting the genie back in the bottle. And we left yellow for last with hesitate_ waffle_ waver and yo-yo. On to the next one.

295545066,Federal employees have received a second email from the Office of Personnel Management asking them what they did last week even as those demands are currently facing legal scrutiny.  Late Friday night_ federal employees received a second email asking them to share five bullet points on their accomplishments last week. It's the latest in an effort led by Trump advisor Elon Musk_ who has said his goal is to monitor productivity_ while searching for fake government employees for which he has presented no evidence.  Employees were also told that going forward_ they were expected to submit similar lists by end of the day every Monday.  Multiple government sources_ including from the Department of the Interior and the Department of Treasury_ shared a copy of the email with NPR on condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation by the Trump administration.
295609292,President Donald Trump said on Friday he would pardon baseball great Pete Rose_ criticizing Major League Baseball for barring the all-time hit champion from the sport’s hall of fame for gambling.  Rose_ who died last year at 83_ was banned from baseball for life.  He admitted in 2004 that he had bet on games_ though never against his own team.  “Over the next few weeks I will be signing a complete pardon of Pete Rose_ who shouldn’t have been gambling on baseball_ but only bet on his team winning_” Trump posted on Truth Social.  “He never betted against himself_ or the other team. He had the most hits_ by far_ in baseball history_ and won more games than anyone in sports history.”  Trump did not say what the pardon would cover_ as Rose was not convicted of a crime.  In 2017_ the Philadelphia Phillies canceled a ceremony to honor Rose after allegations surfaced that he had had a sexual relationship in the 1970s with a girl before she turned 16.  He said she was 16_ the age of consent_ at the time_ ESPN reported.  Rose_ who spent most of his 1963-1986 career with the Cincinnati Reds_ won the World Series three times and leads Major League Baseball’s all-time charts in hits_ games played_ at-bats_ singles and outs.

Where it pertains to the men's Elimination Chamber_ six men compete to earn themselves a shot at WWE Champion Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41. For the six women likewise going through the brutality of the Chamber_ their prize is an opportunity at the Women's World Championship currently held by Rhea Ripley. While those Elimination Chamber matches are clearly the headline attraction at Toronto's Rogers Center_ they're far from the only thing on offer_ with forever rivals Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn going to unsanctioned war_ and WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus once again lacing up her boots as she teams with WWE Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton. With that said_ here's our full guide to where to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams online and on TV around the world today. How to watch WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams from anywhere While Peacock is available all across the U.S. and Netflix is now the standard around the world_ WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 live streams can get a bit confusing.

CM Punk is looking to earn his first WrestleMania main event. (Image credit: Netflix) WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 card_ predictions and storylines  Tag Team Match: Trish Stratus & Tiffany Stratton vs. Nia Jax & Candice LeRae Unsanctioned Match: Kevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn Elimination Chamber Match: Alexa Bliss vs. Bayley vs. Bianca Belair vs. Liv Morgan vs. Naomi vs. Roxanne Perez Elimination Chamber Match: CM Punk vs. Damien Priest vs. Drew McIntyre vs. John Cena vs. Logan Paul vs. Seth Rollins Coming from Toronto's Rogers Center_ WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 is the final Premium Live Event ahead of WrestleMania 41. And in that regard_ this latest PLE has some huge implications for this year's Showcase of the Immortals. To earn a shot at Cody Rhodes and the WWE Championship_ CM Punk_ Damien Priest_ Drew McIntyre_ John Cena_ Logan Paul_ and Seth Rollins do battle in the men's Chamber match. Cena is the sentimental favorite as he continues his retirement tour of 2025_ with this purportedly the final chance for WWE to have John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes at a WrestleMania. Away from Big Match John_ CM Punk seems like the next-best bet to emerge victorious here_ although you can't totally rule out a Drew McIntyre or Seth Rollins win either. And who knows_ maybe WWE swerves us all and gives Damien Priest or Logan Paul the nod to face the American Nightmare at 'Mania. Speaking of Cody_ Elimination Chamber will see the second-generation star give an answer to The Rock where it relates to his "soul". The Final Boss' recent SmackDown appearance suggests that he wants Rhodes to be his own corporate champion_ and it may well be that Rocky has someone else in mind for that role should Cody turn down that offer. In the other Elimination Chamber contest_ a shot at the Women's World Championship is on the line. While Rhea Ripley currently holds that title_ the Eradicator defends the gold against Iyo Sky on the Raw after Elimination Chamber_ meaning it's not a complete lock that the winner of the women's Chamber will be facing Ripley. Whereas John Cena and CM Punk are the standout options for the men's match_ things aren't quite so clear for the women. When looking at the competitors_ they all seem to have other things in place for WrestleMania 41. For example_ Liv Morgan has just become one-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions; Bianca Belair and Naomi seem destined to do something involving Jade Cargill and the mystery behind who attacked Jade late last year; Alexa Bliss likely has the Wyatt Sick6 in her future; and WWE could easily pair Bayley and Roxanne Perez up against one another at WrestleMania. As such_ the women's Elimination Chamber is way more unpredictable than the men's right now. Away from those Elimination Chamber matches_ the heated rivalry between Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn has once again been reignited for these on-off best friends. While Raw General Manager Adam Pearce refused to make Owens vs. Zayn official_ he instead gave the bout the green light to be an unsanctioned no-holds-barred war. After KO turned on Sami by dropping him with a Package Piledriver a few weeks ago_ the pair have since turned up at each other's homes as this situation becomes increasingly personal. While Owens and Zayn are guaranteed a hero's welcome in their home country of Canada_ that will also be the case for hometown Hall of Famer Trish Stratus as she teams up with WWE Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton. Stratus and Stratton go up against the monstrous Nia Jax and her latest sidekick Candice LeRae - with Charlotte Flair likely to be watching on ahead of facing Tiffy at WrestleMania 41.

295753090,President Trump has signed an executive order designating English as the official language of the U.S._ the first such designation in the country's history.  The order_ which Trump signed on Saturday_ rescinds a policy issued by former President Bill Clinton requiring agencies to provide assistance programs for people with limited English proficiency_ according to a White House fact sheet. The order allows agencies to voluntarily keep those support systems in place.  "A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society_ and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language_" the order said.  English is already the official language in more than 30 states_ but Trump's executive order comes at a time when the number of people in the United States who speak languages other than English continues to grow. Roughly one in 10 people now speak a language other than English_ more than triple the amount compared to 1980_ according to 2022 data from the U.S. Census.  Trump's order echoes a longtime campaign pledge and is a move the White House said will "promotes unity_ cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens_ ensure consistency in government operations_ and create a pathway to civic engagement."  At the same time_ some advocacy organizations say the order will hurt immigrant communities and those looking for assistance learning English.  Roman Palomares_ who heads the League of United Latin American Citizens_ criticized the Trump administration's move in a statement issued ahead of the order's official signing.  "Our Founding Fathers enshrined freedom of speech in the First Amendment without limiting it to one language. They envisioned a nation where diversity of thought_ culture_ and expression would be its greatest strength_" said Palomares.  "Declaring English as the only official language directly contradicts that vision_" he added. "America thrives when we embrace inclusivity_ not when we silence the voices of millions who contribute to its success."
295854536,A private lunar lander carrying a drill_ vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday_ the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth’s celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.  Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot_ aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon’s northeastern edge of the near side.  Confirmation of touchdown came from the company’s Mission Control outside Austin_ Texas_ following the action some 225_000 miles away.  “We’re on the moon_” Mission Control reported_ adding the lander was “stable.”  A smooth_ upright landing makes Firefly — a startup founded a decade ago — the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over.  Even countries have faltered_ with only five claiming success: Russia_ the US_ China_ India and Japan.  Two other companies’ landers are hot on Blue Ghost’s heels_ with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.  Launched in mid-January from Florida_ the 6-foot-6 tall lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA.  The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery_ plus $44 million for the science and tech on board.   It’s the third mission under NASA’s commercial lunar delivery program_ intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.  The demos should get two weeks of run time_ before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.  It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet below the surface.  Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust — a scourge for NASA’s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers_ who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.  On its way to the moon_ Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet.  The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon_ with detailed shots of the moon’s gray pockmarked surface.  At the same time_ an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the US GPS and European Galileo constellations_ an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.  The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.  Another lander — a tall and skinny 15-footer built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines — is due to land on the moon Thursday.  It’s aiming for the bottom of the moon_ just 100 miles from the south pole.  That’s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander_ which broke a leg and tipped over.  Despite the tumble_ Intuitive Machines’ lander put the US back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.  A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing.  It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15_ taking a longer_ windier route. Like Intuitive Machines_ ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time.  Its first lander crashed in 2023.  The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace_ but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.  NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year_ realizing some missions will fail_ said the space agency’s top science officer Nicky Fox.  Unlike NASA’s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm_ private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own_ said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.  “Every time we go up_ we’re learning from each other_” Kim said.
295881944,Israel stopped the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip on Sunday and warned of “additional consequences” if Hamas doesn’t accept a new proposal to extend a fragile cease-fire.  Hamas accused Israel of trying to derail the existing ceasefire agreement and said its decision to cut off aid was “cheap extortion_ a war crime and a blatant attack” on the truce_ which took hold in January after more than a year of negotiations.  Both sides stopped short of saying the ceasefire had ended.  The first phase of the ceasefire_ which included a surge in humanitarian assistance_ expired on Saturday.  The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase_ in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.  An Israeli official_ speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations_ said the decision to suspend aid was made in coordination with the Trump administration.  There was no immediate comment from the United States on the proposal announced by Israel or its decision to cut off aid.  Hundreds of aid trucks have entered Gaza daily since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19_ and it was unclear what the immediate impact of the aid cutoff would be.  Israel says the new proposal is backed by the US  Israel said the new proposal_ which it said came from US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff_ called for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan — the Muslim holy month that began over the weekend — and the Jewish Passover holiday_ which ends on April 20.  Under that proposal_ Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire_ according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.  Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was prepared to negotiate over the next phase but insisted on more hostages being freed during the talks. He said Israel had received a side letter from the Biden administration saying there was no automatic transition between the phases of the truce.  “We fulfilled all our commitments (under Phase 1) until the very last day_ which was yesterday_” he told a press conference. “Our position is that during negotiations_ hostages should be released.”  Hamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have “humanitarian consequences” for the hostages and reiterated that the only way to free them was through implementing the existing deal_ which did not specify a timeline for freeing the remaining captives.  Hamas has said it is willing to free the hostages all at once in Phase 2_ but only in return for the release of more Palestinian prisoners_ a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.  An Egyptian official said Hamas and Egypt would not accept a new proposal aimed at returning the remaining hostages without ending the war. The official noted that the agreement had called on the two sides to begin negotiations over Phase 2 in early February.  The official_ who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity_ said mediators were trying to resolve the dispute.  Ceasefire has been marred by disputes  Under the first_ six-week phase of the ceasefire_ Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2_000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.  Israeli forces pulled back from most of Gaza and Israel allowed a surge of humanitarian aid to enter.  But the first phase was marred by repeated disputes_ with each side accusing the other of violations.  Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had approached its forces or entered areas in violation of the truce.  Israel carried out an airstrike on Palestinians who it said were planting an explosive device in northern Gaza near the border on Sunday. Gaza’s Health Ministry said two men were killed.  Hamas paraded the captives — some of whom were emaciated — before crowds in public spectacles that Israel and the United Nations said were cruel and degrading.  Hamas said Israel’s aid suspension was another violation_ saying the ceasefire and aid deliveries were supposed to continue during negotiations over Phase 2.  Israel was accused of blocking aid throughout the war  Israel imposed a complete siege on Gaza in the opening days of the war and only eased it later under US pressure.  UN agencies and aid groups accused Israel of not facilitating enough aid during 15 months of war_ and the Biden administration repeatedly pressed it to do more.  Experts warned on several occasions that hunger was widespread in Gaza and that there was a risk of famine.  The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last year. The allegation is also central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide.  Israel has denied the accusations and rejected both court actions as being biased against it. Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter and blamed shortages on what it said was the UN’s inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid.  The war began when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7_ 2023_ killing some 1_200 people_ mostly civilians_ and taking 251 hostage.  The terrorists are currently holding 59 hostages_ 32 of whom are believed to be dead_ after releasing most of the rest in two ceasefire agreements.  Israel’s offensive has killed over 48_000 Palestinians_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says more than half of those killed were women and children but does not specify how many of the dead were combatants.  Israeli bombardment and ground operations pounded large areas of the strip to rubble and at the height of the conflict displaced some 90% of the population of 2.3 million Palestinians.  The war has left most of Gaza’s population dependent on international aid for food and other essentials.
295763364,ANAHEIM_ Calif. — When Seth Jones first said Feb. 19 he was interested in a trade_ he acknowledged he had no idea whether he would remain on the Blackhawks for two more weeks or five more years.  As it turns out_ Jones didn’t even last two weeks.  The Hawks traded the star defenseman to the Panthers in a Saturday blockbuster_ receiving young goalie Spencer Knight and a first-round pick in 2026 or 2027 in exchange.  The Hawks also sent a 2026 fourth-round pick to Florida and retained $2.47 million of Jones’ exorbitant salary-cap hit through 2030. That’s surely not something general manager Kyle Davidson was excited to do_ but it was likely necessary to make any trade possible.  The return_ however_ is better than most people expected and should be seen as a win for Davidson_ especially considering Jones’ no-movement clause and specific desire to play for a contender significantly limited Davidson’s options.  The first-round pick is a notable asset_ even though it is a few years away. And Knight is an immediate building block whose presence addresses one potential weakness — goaltending — in the Hawks’ future core.  Knight_ formerly one of the highest-touted goalie prospects in recent NHL history_ hasn’t achieved stardom yet — partially because he was stuck behind Sergei Bobrovsky on the Panthers. But there are reasons to believe he could achieve it on the Hawks_ who know well that goalies often need a while to reach their ceilings.  The 6-foot-3 Connecticut native has posted a .906 save percentage in 80 career NHL games_ including a .907 save percentage in 23 games this season and a .937 save percentage in his last eight games since Jan. 3.   He missed the latter portion of the 2022-23 season while in the NHL/NHLPA Assistance Program_ receiving treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder_ before returning to hockey and receiving the Hunt Memorial Award — the AHL’s equivalent of the Masterton Trophy — in 2023-24.  Knight’s arrival creates a goalie logjam for the Hawks_ who have split their NHL starts between Arvid Soderblom and Petr Mrazek this season and also have Laurent Brossoit — who has missed the entire season with a knee injury — under contract.   Knight ($4.5 million)_ Mrazek ($4.25 million) and Brossoit ($3.3 million) each have one year left on their contracts_ while Soderblom is a pending restricted free agent. The Hawks would probably prefer for Knight and Soderblom to be their tandem next season_ so that situation might require additional moves to resolve.  Looking longer-term_ however_ Knight has the inside track to become the franchise’s cornerstone goalie_ premature as it may be to anoint him as such. Existing prospect goalies Drew Commesso and Adam Gajan have struggled this season in the AHL and NCAA_ respectively_ although they can’t be counted out yet.  As far as Jones goes_ he finishes his disappointing four-year Hawks tenure with 146 points in 259 games_ having averaged 25:15 of ice time per game.  Without him_ the Hawks will temporarily turn to Alex Vlasic as their No. 1 defenseman_ but that will be a hole to address this summer since top prospects Artyom Levshunov and Sam Rinzel aren’t quite ready to take over the throne. That had been the main argument against trading Jones: the current roster is better with him than without him.  The Panthers have top defenseman Aaron Ekblad_ who is right-handed like Jones_ staring down unrestricted free agency this summer. Acquiring Jones not only loads them up for their 2025 playoff run but also_ if Ekblad walks_ provides a locked-in_ long-term replacement on their first pairing opposite left-handed Gustav Forsling.   In that case_ Ekblad could circuitously become a high-priority target for the Hawks_ who plan to be aggressive bringing in talent this summer. They already had a lot of cap space before Saturday; they now have an absurd amount.
295749882,The 49ers didn’t waste any time satisfying Deebo Samuel’s request for a trade_ reportedly agreeing on Saturday to send the star receiver to the Washington Commanders for a fifth-round draft pick.  ESPN’s Adam Schefter was the first to report the agreement.  Wednesday during at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis_ 49ers general manager John Lynch confirmed that the team had give the 29-year-old receiver permission to seek a trade. Samuel_ who iis scheduled to earn $21.7 million this season_ joins an already formidable offense in Washington led by quarterback Jayden Daniels.  Some sort of move was anticipated since Samuel during the Super Bowl Samuel leaked the news to ESPN that he wanted to be traded from the 49ers. He said at the time he was “more than thankful” to the 49ers and coach Kyle Shanahan in particular for “giving him the opportunity of a lifetime.”  Lynch addressed the issue at the combine this week_ saying_ “He’s asked for a fresh start and I think we’re going to honor that. I don’t like seeing great players leave and he is a great player. … He makes plays and he makes game-changing plays.”  Samuel was an All-Pro with the 49ers in 2021_ producing 1_770 yards from scrimmage and scoring 14 touchdowns. He signed a three-year_ $71.6 million extension following that season and has been unable to replicate that kind of production.  Samuel was hurt much of this season_ finishing with 51 catches for 670 yards and three touchdowns.  Check back for more on this developing story.
295773376,A brush fire along the South Carolina coast was threatening Carolina Forest_ S.C._ just west of Myrtle Beach. That fire was 75 percent contained as of early Saturday night_ according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.  “Crews are continuing to work toward the containment of this fire_” the Horry County Fire Rescue_ which is leading efforts to fight the fire_ said on social media on Saturday evening. Several neighborhoods in Carolina Forest were under an evacuation order.  Another fire broke out near Six Mile_ S.C._ a rural town about 30 miles west of Greenville. County officials there had recommended evacuations along several streets but_ as of Saturday evening_ no evacuations had been ordered.  The fires ignited while a large portion of the southeastern United States was under a red-flag warning_ an alert from the National Weather Service indicating a high risk of fires.  Gusty winds_ dry air and afternoon high temperatures in the low 70s helped fuel the rapid spread of the fires.

295768322,John Cena won the Elimination Chamber. Credit: WWE  John Cena won his record fourth Elimination Chamber_ ousting CM Punk and tying Triple H for the most ever.  The WWE men’s Elimination Chamber aired prior to WWE’s main event segment_ which featured Cody Rhodes making his decision on whether or not he would sell his soul to The Rock. This was very interesting as the winner of the Chamber could either be an existing heel who could reappear in the main event_ or a babyface turning heel in the main event. With Rhodes strongly favored to decline The Rock’s offer_ there was also a possibility of Rock finding his own Manchurian champion to do his bidding against Rhodes.  The men’s Elimination Chamber had a tough act to follow after Jade Cargill dramatically returned in the women’s Chamber in the night.  Everything That Happened In The Men’s Elimination Chamber  Consummate heel Logan Paul walked out first with an American flag. Of course_ he was booed by the partisan Canadian crowd. Damian Priest walked out next_ followed by CM Punk and John Cena. This meant Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre were set to start the Chamber in a rematch of their WrestleMania 40 opener.  Rollins_ dressed like a spike obstacle from Sonic the Hedgehog_ entered last. The arena filled up with light “CM Punk” chants as Rollins and McIntrye did battle to start the match.  A smarmy CM Punk egged Rollins on while Seth banged McIntyre’s head on Punk’s pod.  After using his breath last year_ Logan Paul used graffiti to decorate his pod. One of his tags read “OVO_” in honor of Canadian hip hop superstar Drake_ who was in attendance.  Damian Priest was first out of the pods. He threw Seth Rollins into Drew McIntyre with a Razor’s edge. Between Roxanne Perez-Bayley. Tiffany Stratton-Trish Stratus and Damian Priest-Razor Ramon_ there was a lot of talk of idols on this show.  MORE FOR YOU  Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Sunday_ March 2nd  WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 Results: Jade Cargill Returns_ Bianca Belair Wins  WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 Results: Trish Stratus And Tiffany Stratton Win  Even with Paul still in the pods_ fans chanted “F.U. Logan!" They got their wish as Logan Paul officially entered the Chamber. After a flurry of offense_ Paul taunted Canada and mauled by Priest because of it.  John Cena entered the final Elimination Chamber match of his career as he ran wild on everybody. Fans exploded as Cena finished off his offense with an AA to Seth Rollins and a Five Knuckle Shuffle on Logan Paul.  After an AA to Paul_ Cena immediately ate a Claymore Kick. McIntyre was then rolled up by Priest for the elimination. This_ after McIntyre made a big deal of wanting to embarrass John Cena_ only to take his eye off the ball and lose to Priest because of it. McIntyre stuck Priest with a Claymore Kick_ and Paul finished off Priest with a Frog Splash from the top of the pod. It’ll certainly be McIntyre vs. Priest at WrestleMania.  CM Punk entered last_ telling Paul “you know it’s me_ MFer.” Punk teased a spot from the top of the pod before locking eyes with John Cena to the chorus of “holy s—t” chants.  Rollins stopped the party with his own obsession with Punk. Rollins told Cena “Why don’t you go back and film some more movies?! His ass is mine! Stay out of it!”  As Cena and Rollins went back and forth_ Paul broke it up. Punk stuck Paul with a GTS_ bringing the field down to three.  It was noted that the Final 3 (Cena_ Punk_ Rollins) have held 26 world championships among them. There were dueling “let’s go Cena/CM Punk!” chants. No love for poor Seth_ who played the de facto heel.  After a Hart Attack from Punk and Cena on Rollins_ a tribute to Bret Hart and the Hart Foundation_ Punk and Cena did battle. More fans sided with the sympathetic Cena. Cena trapped Punk in an STF_ which Punk countered with an Anaconda Vice. Each man escaped the other’s finishing hold.  Punk countered a Punk cross body with an AA. Nearfall. “This is awesome!”  Seth Rollins threw Cena through the glass pod and set his sights on CM Punk. Rollins hit Punk with a Pedigree for a nearfall. Seth came back with a Buckle Bomb followed by a stomp for another long two count.  Cena entered the fray_ causing a distraction. Both Cena and Punk hit their finishers on Rollins and Rollins lost. Cole once again emphasized that Seth Rollins’ obsession with Cena cost him the match.  Both Cena and Punk kicked out of the GTS and the AA_ respectively. Rollins hit Punk with a Stomp_ prompting Cena to trap Punk in the STF. Punk passed out as Cena won.  After the match_ Cody and Cena faced off. Cody shook Cena’s hand. This brought out The Rock_ who entered to a remixed version of his song featuring Travis Scott.  Follow me on Twitter.

295753780,Harrison Ford reportedly stepped down as a presenter at the 2025 Oscars after he was diagnosed with shingles.

Jackson and Gal Gadot.  One of his last public outings was at the 2025 SAG Awards in Los Angeles on Feb. 23.

295984728,By LEANNE ITALIE_ Associated Press  NEW YORK (AP) — Mikey Madison_ Timothée Chalamet_ Danielle Deadwyler_ Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. The list of celebrities with red carpet wow momentum at the Oscars is long.  Julianne Hough kicked things off Sunday in an elegant light beige ethereal look straight off the Christian Dior spring 2025 runway.  The 97th Oscars come less than two months after the devastating Los Angeles fires subdued carpet dressing for a time. As the city moves into rebuild mode_ stars have been upping their fashion games heading into the biggest awards night of the season.  Some are notable for playing it glam but safe.  Like Margot Robbie’s Barbie pink_ Grande has been mostly sticking to a far paler hue_ her signature and an homage to her “Wicked” good witch_ Glinda. Castmate and carpet bestie Erivo has always taken fashion risks. She ditched her Elphaba black for last week’s Screen Actors Guild awards_ opting for a silver Givenchy look with a high shaggy collar worthy of her bad witch role.  Chalamet has been all over the place on carpet dressing as he navigates his Bob Dylan attention from “A Complete Unknown.” At the SAGs_ he married a bright brat green button-up shirt from Chrome Hearts with a shiny black leather suit and a bolo tie as he continues to channel the real-life icon he plays.  Deadwyler is a risk-taker_ too. She wore a bright red strapless 3D structured tiered gown from Louis Vuitton at the SAGs.  Some planning to attend as nominees and presenters have generated fashion buzz for different reasons. Jeremy Strong wore a mint green velvet Loro Piana suit with a bucket hat in the same color to the Golden Globes. His white turtleneck topped it all off. He’s nominated for supporting actor at the Oscars.  At the SAGs_ strong wore a different shade of green. It was a dusty green for a custom Haans Nicholas Mott suit with satin shawl lapels. He wore it with a bowtie.  Madison_ a new fashion darling_ was among several stars to go vintage at the recent dinner for Oscar nominees. The star of “Anora” wore a dark blue velvet gown by Bill Blass from 1987. She collected a BAFTA award earlier this month in a custom Prada in ivory_ accessorizing with a long matching stole and a vintage Tiffany & Co. diamond necklace.  She also went Hollywood bombshell at the SAGs with a strapless silver Louis Vuitton look with a large pleated bow at the waist. She’s been working with stylist Jamie Mizrahi_ who has dressed Adele and Jennifer Lawrence_ among many other celebs.

296042490,By HANNAH SCHOENBAUM_ Associated Press  LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sean Baker won best director at the Oscars on Sunday for “Anora_” bookending a dominant awards season for the American filmmaker whose stories seek to humanize sex workers and immigrants.  Baker_ 53_ wrote_ produced_ directed and edited the film_ which is also among the top contenders for best picture. The comedy-drama stars Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the impetuous son of a Russian oligarch. They impulsively tie the knot on a ketamine-induced Las Vegas getaway_ angering his parents_ who send their bumbling henchmen after the couple to force an annulment.  “If you didn’t cast Mikey Madison in ‘Once Upon a Time_’ there would be no ‘Anora_’” Baker told Quentin Tarantino_ who presented the award.  Baker came into the night the favorite for the directing Oscar after earning the top prize from the Directors Guild of America_ a win that historically all but guarantees an Oscars victory. He also took home the top awards at the Producers Guild and Independent Spirit Awards.  This year’s best director lineup featured five first-time nominees in the category for the first time in nearly three decades. All had writing credits on their respective films_ demonstrating the academy’s growing preference for auteurs who can masterfully bring their own vision to life. For the Oscar_ he beat out Brady Corbet of “The Brutalist_” James Mangold of “A Complete Unknown_” Jacques Audiard of “Emilia Pérez” and Coralie Fargeat of “The Substance.”  Going into the night_ Baker had the potential to win a record four Oscars for “Anora_” which was nominated for six in total. He won for best original screenplay and best editing — a rarity as directors don’t typically cut their own films. He is also up for best picture.  “Anora” brings Baker’s signature style of provocative comedy from indie theaters into the mainstream_ blending slapstick humor with social commentary in a way that makes lessons about marginalized groups palatable to a wider audience. He made the film on a modest budget of $6 million — an amount one producer joked is smaller than the catering budget of some of its competitors. Last year’s best picture winner_ “Oppenheimer_” had a $100 million budget.  Baker has been vocal about the difficulty of making independent films and surviving as an indie filmmaker in an industry that increasingly supports big-budget spectacles. In a rousing speech at the Independent Spirit Awards_ he said indies are in danger of becoming “calling card films” — movies made only as a means to get hired for projects at major studios. Without backing for independent films_ he said_ some of the most creative and innovative projects might never be made.  He exhorted filmmakers to keep moving films for the big screen_ bemoaning the erosion of the theatergoing experience.  “Watching a film in the theater with an audience is an experience. We can laugh together_ cry together_ scream in fright together_ perhaps sit in devastated silence together. In a time in which the world can feel very divided_ this is more important than ever. It’s a communal experience you simply don’t get at home_” he said.  Baker has long been passionate about using his craft to help destigmatize sex work. His 2012 film “Starlet” follows a budding friendship between an adult film star and a crotchety widow who sells her a thermos full of cash at a yard sale. Baker said the connections he formed with sex workers involved in the project inspired him to feature them in several other films.  He received widespread praise for “Tangerine” (2015)_ in which he used three iPhone 5S smartphones to tell a story about transgender sex workers in Los Angeles. In “The Florida Project” (2017)_ a single mother living in an Orlando motel turns to sex work to provide for her daughter. And “Red Rocket” (2021) follows a retired porn actor’s journey back to his small Texas hometown.
296024294,From “Center Stage” to the golden stage! Zoe Saldaña’s talent is undeniable.  The star_ 46_ took home her first Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez” at the 2025 Academy Awards on Sunday.  “My mom is here. My whole family is here. I am floored by this honor_” Saldaña said through tears while accepting her award. “To my cast and my crew of Emilia Pérez_ I’m sharing this award with you.”  She added_ “To my mom_ my dad_ and my sisters – everything brave_ outrageous and good I’ve ever done in my life is because of you.”  Giving her other half_ Marco Perego_ whom she tied the knot with in 2013_ a shout out_ Saldaña continued_ “And to my husband with that beautiful hair_ the biggest honor in my life is being your partner.”  “My grandmother came to this country in 1961 I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard working hands. I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy award and I know I won’t be the last.”  She beat out Monica Barbaro (“A Complete Unknown”)_ Ariana Grande (“Wicked”)_ Felicity Jones (“The Brutalist”) and Isabella Rossellini (“Conclave”).  The accolade comes after Saldaña swept award season_ taking home the Golden Globe_ Critics’ Choice_ BAFTA_ and SAG Award for playing lawyer Rita Mora Castro.  The then 20-year-old actress made her acting debut in 1999 with a guest role in two episodes of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”  At age 21_ Saldaña put on her pointe shoes as she landed her first feature film role in the 2000 dance musical “Center Stage_” as ballet dancer Eva Rodríguez.  “I went in and I read the sides_ and they liked what I did and then they asked me to come back and they put me with a ballet teacher in a room and they just video recorded me doing some moves_” she told Entertainment Weekly in 2022 about landing the part. “And then I met [the director] Nicholas Hytner for it.”  “So_ once I booked the role of Eva Rodriguez_ then it was just about learning the choreography and getting to meet the cast_” Saldaña recalled.  Reflecting on filming the project_ she gushed_ “That was a wonderful summer. We shot in the summer of 1999. I know I’m dating myself_ but I love it. I turned 21 on that set and we shot it in Lincoln Center. Obviously in the city of my dreams. Being a New Yorker I love it. We shot it in Lincoln Center which was always a dream of mine to perform on that stage and I did.”  Saldaña then starred opposite Britney Spears and Taryn Manning in the 2002 rom-com “Crossroads.”  The trio played childhood best friends who took a cross-country road trip to California after graduating high school.  When asked if she would be open to a sequel_ Saldaña told Variety in 2024_ “Why not?”  But under certain conditions.  “I feel like it would only work if Britney comes back and plays her character again_” she elaborated. “And Taryn Manning does as well_ and Anson Mount. And that we write realistic sort of scenarios for them. That would be beautiful.”  With two hit movies under her belt_ the phone calls kept coming for Saldaña in the 2000s.  She starred in the 2005 flick “Guess Who” with Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac. Saldaña played a young woman who brings home her new fiancé (Kutcher) to meet her parents.  The actress shared that the director_ Kevin Rodney Sullivan_ allowed the cast to bring their own perspectives about biracial relationships to the project.  “I’m from New York_ so this is not something that’s common for me_” Saldaña said while on “The Early Show” at the time. “My family is very_ very diverse and very mixed_ and it is not an issue in my house. I was very open about that. This is what I’m putting on my table: I don’t know about this topic_ and I would love to explore it and take this message out — that was the sole purpose for everybody. We have a common message; let’s treat with respect; and at same time let’s laugh.”  By 2009_ she joined James Cameron’s “Avatar” franchise_ playing the role of Neytiri. Saldaña is set to reprise her role in the fictitious land of Pandora in “Avatar: Fire and Ash_” scheduled for release in December.   Saldaña also starred as Nyota Uhura in “Star Trek_” followed by “Star Trek Into Darkness” in 2013 and “Star Trek Beyond” in 2016.  As for the possibility of a fourth “Star Trek” film_ Saldaña told The Playlist in 2024_ “I still have hope_” calling the first three projects “a wonderful experience.”  She added_ “I know that they’re always trying to sort of aim to wrangle everybody together_ but I also know that Paramount is working on a new sort of fresh take on ‘Star Trek_’ which I think is such a wonderful franchise that should live for a very long time_ whether or not us as the original remake cast can come back. I don’t know_ but I certainly hope so.”  In 2014_ she took on the character of Gamora in “Guardians of the Galaxy” before reprising the green-skinned warrior princess four more times: “Galaxy Vol. 2_” (2017)_ “Avengers: Infinity War” (2018)_ “Avengers: Endgame” (2019) and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” (2023).   In 2023_ Saldaña began playing CIA officer in the Paramount+ spy series “Special Ops: Lioness” alongside Nicole Kidman.  Speaking about working with Kidman_ 57_ Saldaña told The Wrap in Nov. 2024_ “It’s so rewarding. I get to call her a friend. We have so many things in common — our dedication to our work_ but primarily our dedication to our families.  “In the mornings_ we’re constantly talking about what we’re going to be doing_ in addition to breaking from our work and talking about personal things.”  Fast-forward to 2024 and the Netflix musical thriller “Emilia Pérez.”  The movie led the 2025 Oscars race with 13 nominations_ coming only one nod shy of tying the record for most-ever nominations for a movie. The project also marked the most-ever nods for a film predominantly in a non-English language.  “Emilia Pérez” follows a Mexican drug cartel leader (played by Karla Sofía Gascón) who transitions into a woman.  When Saldaña took home the trophy at the 2025 SAG Awards_ she took a moment to reflect on her career.  “To be in this room…this is my community_ this is my circus_” she began. “Thank you to SAG-AFTRA. I got my first SAG card in 1998. I didn’t even know what SAG was. I am grateful that my mother and father and sisters looked it up and helped me educate myself to know what it means to be a part of a union that protects me so I can make a living out of this crazy industry.”  “I am proud to be a part of a union that allows me to be who I am. I’ve never been questioned where I come from or judged for how I speak or what my pronouns are_” Saldaña continued.   “Everyone has the right to be who they are. ‘Emilia Perez‘ is about truth and love and us actors really have to tell stories that are thought-provoking and beautiful and live within the spectrum of artistic freedom.”

296037708,By JONATHAN LANDRUM Jr.  LOS ANGELES (AP) — “I’m Still Here_” a Brazilian film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades_ won the Oscar on Sunday for best international film.  The Walter Salles film stars Fernanda Torres as Eunice Paiva_ the wife of Rubens Paiva_ a former leftist Brazilian congressman who_ at the height of the country’s military dictatorship in 1971_ was taken from his family’s Rio de Janeiro home and never returned.  The focus of “I’m Still Here_” based on the memoir by Paiva’s son Marcelo_ is Eunice_ the mother of five left to remake their family’s life with neither her husband nor any answers for his disappearance. It unfolds as a portrait of a different kind of political resistance — one of steadfast endurance.  Eunice refuses the military dictatorship’s attempt to break her and her family. When_ in one scene_ Eunice and her children — by then long without their disappeared father — pose for a newspaper photograph_ she tells them to smile.  “The smile is a kind of resistance_” Torres told The Associated Press. “It’s not that they’re living happily. It’s a tragedy. Marcelo recently said something that Eunice said that I had never heard: ‘We are not a victim.

296375266,Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect in hours  The U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. Tariffs on goods from China will increase from 10% to 20%. Kelly O'Grady_ CBS News MoneyWatch correspondent_ and Sarah McGregor_ managing editor for Bloomberg News' national desk_ join "America Decides" with analysis.
296412296,In just six weeks_ President Donald Trump has wiped out diversity initiatives_ cut foreign aid_ chopped the federal workforce_ declared that America has only two genders and one official language_ renamed the Gulf of Mexico_ sided with Russia over the democracy it invaded and unleashed trade wars with Canada_ Mexico_ China and the European Union.  Tariffs on North American imports will take effect on Tuesday. Californians could see higher prices on beer_ fresh produce_ timber_ cars and other goods.  Lawmakers are bracing for more surprises Tuesday night in the first address of his second term. It’s not technically a State of the Union speech_ but very similar. It begins at 6 p.m. Pacific Time.  Reality TV-Worthy Drama  Trump was on trial during his 2020 State of the Union address_ though the Senate would acquit him the next day. That was his first impeachment_ on charges involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump’s efforts to pressure him into announcing a corruption probe that would tarnish Democrat Joe Biden ahead of the election.  More on Zelensky later.  Trump_ the former reality TV star_ pulled out all the stops to keep Congress and the home audience attentive.  Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh_ suffering advanced lung cancer_ was seated with first lady Melania Trump. His jaw dropped when Trump announced a Presidential Medal of Freedom_ the nation’s highest civilian honor_ which the first lady then placed around his neck.  Also in the first lady’s box: Army spouse Amy Williams and her children. Her husband_ Sgt. 1st Class Townsend Williams_ had been away for months on his fourth tour in Afghanistan. Trump thanked her for her sacrifice — then announced a reunion on live television.  “I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight_” Trump said.  The couple hugged as most of the House chamber gave a standing ovation.  The night ended with Speaker Nancy Pelosi tearing Trump’s speech into pieces. The president had snubbed her offer of a handshake at the start of the evening. She said later that she’d been making a small tear in each page that contained a falsehood. Once she realized that every page was torn_ she decided to shred it.  That won’t happen Tuesday night. Two Republicans will be seated behind Trump this time: Vice President JD Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson.  Democratic Pushback  During the 2020 address_ Democratic congresswomen wore white to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.  The show of solidarity made it even more obvious than usual when opposition lawmakers remained seated as Trump allies stood and cheered. Even without matching outfits_ the contrast will be stark again on Tuesday night.  Lawmakers usually use their guest tickets to make a political point.  Many Democrats are bringing constituents who lost their jobs or face funding cuts under billionaire Elon Musk’s government efficiency effort.  Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego is bringing a disabled Army veteran from north Phoenix_ Kyle Rahn_ who was fired two weeks ago — via email — from a cybersecurity job at the Department of Homeland Security.  Rahn served three tours in Iraq before going to work as a civilian for the Defense Department. In all_ he spent 16 years in public service before being pushed out by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE_ the White House office led by Musk.  “This isn’t just about me_ it’s about every government worker who dedicated their lives to strengthening this nation_” Rahn said in a statement released by Gallego’s office.  Rep. Scott Peters from San Diego is bringing James B. Brewer_ medical professor and chair of the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego_ whose work is threatened by cuts in funding for the National Institutes of Health.  “Every family knows the pain of watching a family member in the clutches of Alzheimer’s and would give anything for more time with the person they love_” said Peters. “There is not a single person on the street who would disagree that the government should invest more_ not less_ in finding therapies and a cure for this terrible condition.   “I am honored to bring Dr. Brewer to the President’s address to highlight the existential threat of the administration’s NIH proposals for life-changing and life-saving research in San Diego and beyond.”  Russia-Ukraine  Trump’s Oval Office shouting match with Zelensky on Friday threw European allies into a panic_ cementing the belief that the United States has abandoned an 80-year policy of standing with democracies against aggression.  Trump insisted during that meeting that he’s not choosing Russia over Ukraine_ though that was the perception he left by berating the Ukrainian leader for not being grateful enough for American military support.  “I’m not aligned with Putin_ I’m not aligned with anybody_” Trump told reporters. “I’m aligned with the United States of America.”  Trump had already ruled out Ukraine’s demand for a ceasefire to hinge on Russia giving back land it has seized.  Even some of Trump’s closest Republican allies have expressed discomfort with his stance. Such internal dissent has been rare_ and foreign officials will be looking for signs of that tension Tuesday night.  “I have repeatedly urged President Trump that it is crucial for this war to end with a decisive and unmistakable defeat for Putin and Russia_” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posted on X on Saturday_ the day after the Oval Office confrontation.  On Sunday_ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state television that Putin’s government was pleased at the Oval Office meeting_ because it shows that Washington “largely aligns with our vision.”  During his campaign_ Trump promised to lower inflation and cut the cost of living.  So far in his second term_ Trump has focused on other priorities. Republicans have downplayed those pledges and stopped complaining about high prices at the fuel pump and supermarket.  Democrats are working overtime to remind voters that eggs remain expensive and that inflation hasn’t gone away as Trump promised.  Immigration and Deportations  Immigration enforcement was another major campaign pledge_ and critics and allies alike will be listening for details on how Trump plans to proceed.  On Saturday_ Trump boasted that the Border Patrol caught just 8_326 people crossing the southern border illegally in February — the lowest monthly tally “in History – BY FAR!” (Comparable federal data only goes back to 2000 and this is the lowest since then_ though at least one expert said it may be the lowest since the 1960s.)  Based on that_ he declared on his Truth Social Trump platform_ “The Invasion of our Country is OVER.”  Republicans have been arguing for years that illegal border crossings amounted to an invasion_ using that to justify a variety of policies — including Trump’s central promise of the 2024 campaign_ a mass deportation effort to eject millions of people.  Earlier in this term_ Trump tried to end automatic birthright citizenship. A federal judge blocked that move as a violation of the 14th Amendment_ which confers U.S. citizenship on anyone born on U.S. soil.  Last week_ Trump announced a plan to let wealthy foreigners purchase permanent residency for $5 million. He called it a “gold card.” Officials said that would replace the EB-5 program that allows foreigners to obtain U.S. residency by investing at least $800_000.  “He deployed the military … (and) new law enforcement strategies_ new prosecution strategies and significant counter-cartel and counter-smuggling strategies that have resulted in a 95% drop in illegal crossings_” Stephen Miller_ a top Trump adviser_ told reporters Monday at the White House. “You will never find an example of any law enforcement threat or national security threat where you’ve achieved such a rapid 180.”  This article was produced by Cronkite News at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.
296428414,March 3 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night as he lays out his vision for a second term.  While the speech is not referred to as a State of the Union_ which is the presidential address given during subsequent years in office_ Trump is expected to discuss the state of his first six weeks since his inauguration as his administration cracks down on illegal immigration_ cuts wasteful spending and works to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.  The president will address members from both chambers of Congress_ as well as Supreme Court justices and his Cabinet. Trump has invited other guests_ including Elon Musk_ who is in charge of cutting government spending through the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency. The speech begins at 9 p.m. ET_ with most networks airing it live or streaming it online.  House Speaker Mike Johnson_ R-Ky._ invited Trump to speak before Congress in a letter delivered shortly after his inauguration.  "It is my distinct honor and great privilege to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday_ March_ 4_ 2025_ in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives_ to share your America First vision for our legislative future_" Johnson wrote Jan. 25.  On Monday_ Johnson warned lawmakers to be "on their best behavior" during Trump's address.  "We ought to maintain decorum_" Johnson told reporters_ despite Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. "It's an important event for the country and everybody needs to be on their best behavior. So_ I am praying that's true."  House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries_ D-N.Y._ said he and Democratic leaders will attend "to make clear to the nation that there is a strong opposition party ready_ willing and able to serve as a check and balance on the excesses of the administration."  Sen. Elissa Slotkin_ D-Mich._ a first-term senator_ is slated to deliver the Democratic response following Trump's speech. Rep. Adriano Espaillat_ D-N.Y._ will deliver the Spanish language response.  On Monday_ the White House called Trump's joint address -- which it titled The Renewal of the American Dream -- "must-see TV."  "President Trump has accomplished more in one month than any president in four years -- and the renewal of the American dream is well underway. In his Joint Address to Congress_ President Trump will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold_ ambitious and common sense vision for the future_" the White House wrote in a statement.  Trump's address to Congress comes one day after he ordered a "pause" in military aid to Ukraine following a contentious exchange Friday in the Oval Office with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. It also comes the same day proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada are scheduled to go into effect.  "Preparations are underway to welcome POTUS for his joint address to Congress_" Johnson wrote Monday in a post on X. "It's going to be big!"

296558610,Access to guns is tightly controlled in Mexico_ and it is nearly impossible for civilians to legally obtain the kinds of military-style weapons favored by the cartels. In their legal filings_ lawyers for Mexico cited statistics showing that a majority of guns from Mexican crime scenes — between 70 and 90 percent — come from the United States. They also contend that gun dealers in the states that border Mexico sell twice as many weapons as dealers in other parts of the United States.  The argument before the court is focused on a threshold issue: whether a 2005 federal law prevents such a suit by Mexico against the gun makers. The law_ the Protection of Lawful Arms in Commerce Act_ was passed after a growing number of lawsuits aimed to hold the gun industry liable in mass shootings in the United States. It prohibits many types of lawsuits against gun manufacturers and sellers — but it allows claims to proceed if plaintiffs can show that their injuries were directly caused by knowing violations of firearms laws.
296454860,Mavericks star guard Kyrie Irving suffered a left knee sprain in Monday’s game against Sacramento_ according to ESPN News Services.  The injury occurred during the first quarter. Irving drove between defenders DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas in the lane and fell to the court. He grabbed at his left knee and was down face first for a few minutes.  DeRozan was called for a reach-in foul on the play and Irving managed to make two free throws before being helped to the locker room.  It’s another brutal blow for the Mavericks_ who have been hit by a wave of injuries since the controversial trade of Luka Doncic. Anthony Davis suffered an adductor strain in his first game with Dallas and remains sidelined. Dereck Lively_ Daniel Gafford and Caleb Martin are also on the mend.  Irving came into the contest averaging 25.0 points_ 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists in 49 games. He’s reached the 30-point mark in five games since the Doncic trade.  To make matters worse_ Jaden Hardy exited the game during the second half with a right ankle sprain_ Grant Afseth of the Dallas Hoops Journal tweets. The Mavs were blown out_ 122-98.  If Irving needs to miss significant time_ Spencer Dinwiddie will likely absorb the bulk of his minutes.
296538832,There seems to be no stopping President Donald Trump from imposing more tariffs on Canada and Mexico_ despite long-standing trade ties with both nations."No room left for Mexico or for Canada_" he said Monday in response to questions on whether new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods will be in place Tuesday_ triggering a plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average_ Nasdaq_ and S&P 500.Aside from tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports_ Trump has also gone hard on China_ slapping an additional 10% tariff on certain Chinese goods last month_ a move that drew sharp criticism from Beijing.With the Trump trade war 2.0 in full swing -- especially after he ordered a study into establishing reciprocal tariffs -- affected countries are left with little choice but to threaten countermeasures.Beijing blasts Trump's alleged use of "fentanyl issue" in trade clashThe Chinese government was quick to criticize Trump since the additional tariffs were announced as soon as he took office for the second time. On Tuesday_ Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian reiterated that the country will fight back if necessary.Lin said the Trump administration was using "the fentanyl issue as a pretext to threaten China with tariff hikes on its imports."The House Select Committee on China revealed in a 2024 report that the country was directly subsidizing production of illicit fentanyl precursors for sale overseas_ helping drive the opioid crisis in the U.S.For China_ the fentanyl issue isn't really related to the trade war_ with Lin reiterating that tying the matter to tariffs was wrong."China opposes this move and will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard its legitimate interests_" Lin warned_ indicating Beijing will be prepared to hit the U.S. with more tariffs if pushed to the limit.China has done this in the past_ and it is not new to retaliatory tariffs on American goods. It has even continued to challenge the U.S. in the tech arms race.Canada puts its foot down on "unjustified" tariffsFollowing Trump's Tuesday remarks that the U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on Canadian goods and another 10% on Canadian energy_ Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came out with a firm statement."Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered. Should American tariffs come into effect tonight_ Canada will_ effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow_ respond with 25% tariffs against $155 billion of American goods_" he said.He went on to note that the tariffs will be in place until the Trump government withdraws the levies on Canadian products and energy.Trudeau also reminded Trump that it was him who successfully negotiated a trade agreement with Canada during his first term_ a deal that has effectively been broken due to his tariffs on Canadian goods.Mexico is ready for any tariff actionOn Monday_ Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country was ready should Trump push through with the tariffs.She said the government has a "plan B_ C_ D_" though she didn't go into full details_ noting that her administration will wait and see how Trump moves before it takes any action.On the other hand_ Sheinbaum was more stern and detailed Sunday_ when she delivered a powerful speech that drew claps from the audience in Colima during the delivery of welfare programs for the municipality."I have said it other times: the United States would not be what it is_ if it were not for the Mexicans who work on the other side_ if there were no countrymen working in the fields on the other side_ the best workers in the fields_ there would be no food on the table of Americans_" she said_ as per a Google translation.Unlike Canada_ which has a clear plan on retaliation_ Mexico may be planning to keep its retaliatory actions under wraps until the last minute.Still_ the latest statements from China_ Canada_ and Mexico indicate that they refuse to go down without a fight in the trade war.The tariffs may hurt them more than the world's largest economy_ but collectively_ retaliatory tariffs from three of the U.S.'s top trading partners will also have an impact on the American economy.

296774896,March 4 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump is addressing a joint session of Congress_ the first of his second term since assuming office six weeks ago_ as he lays out his domestic and foreign policy agendas before a divided House and Senate.  Early in the address_ Trump called it a "great honor" and declared "America is back."  "Six weeks ago_ I stood beneath the dome of this capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the most successful era in the history of our country_" Trump started his speech_ flanked by Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson who sat behind him. "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years and we are just getting started."  "I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging -- bigger and better than ever before_" Trump said as half of the chamber cheered and stood.  "The American dream is unstoppable_ and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnesses_ and perhaps will never witness again.  "Now_ for the first time in modern history_ more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction_" Trump added_ before touting he won the popular vote_ which drew loud boos from Democrats and chants of "USA" from Republicans.  Johnson immediately gaveled a warning to "restore order_" as Rep. Al Green_ D-Texas_ was escorted out of the chamber. Trump chided Democrats for not supporting his policies_ which he said are "so good for the country."  The president's address_ which is not a State of the Union address as it comes less than two months after assuming office_ is being delivered Tuesday night to members of Congress_ U.S. Supreme Court justices_ members of Trump's Cabinet -- many of them already confirmed -- and invited guests inside the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington_ D.C.  President Trump entered the House chamber at 9:14 p.m. ET_ wearing a blue suit and purple tie_ to loud cheers and a standing ovation as he pumped his fist_ while the other half of the chamber remained seated with many booing his arrival. Many started chanting "USA_ USA" as Trump neared the podium to shake hands with Vance and Johnson.  First lady Melania Trump_ who was wearing a gray suit_ also received a standing ovation from half of the chamber as she entered and waved to those in attendance. Members of the Democratic Women's Caucus are wearing the color pink to honor the rights of women and to protest Trump's speech. "Pink is the color of power and protest_" according to Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández_ D-N.M.  Trump's speech_ titled "The Renewal of the American Dream_" is his first significant speech of his second non-consecutive term. Trump is the second president in U.S. history_ after Grover Cleveland_ to win non-consecutive terms in the White House.  "Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families_" Trump said. "As you know_ we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices_ pushed up the cost of groceries and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans."  "We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years_ but perhaps even in the history of our country. As president_ I am fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again_" Trump said to another standing ovation from Republicans as Democrats held signs that said "save Medicaid" and "stop Musk."  Trump addressed the high price of eggs_ saying "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control and we are working hard to get it back down."  And he discussed his plan to fight inflation by reducing the cost of energy and "drill baby_ drill_" as well as cutting government waste through the Department of Government Efficiency as he introduced Elon Musk to loud cheers and boos.  Trump then listed government waste_ including "scholarships in Burma_" and "$8 million for making mice transgender. This is real_" he said_ adding "$20 million for an Arab Sesame Street program" and "$59 million for luxury hotels for migrants in New York City."  "All of these scams have been found out and exposed and terminated by mostly young people headed up by Elon_ and we appreciate it_" Trump said as half of the chamber stood up and cheered.  "We have taken back the money to reduce the debt and fight inflation_" Trump said_ as he began listing the millions of people on the Social Security payroll over the age of 150 years old.  "We are a much healthier nation than we thought_ right Bobby?" Trump said as he pointed to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.  The president's joint address to Congress drew strong reactions from both sides of the aisle as it falls on the same day the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. It also comes amid stalled efforts to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine following a contentious White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and subsequent "pause" on military aid to Ukraine.  During his first six weeks in office_ Trump signed more than 75 executive orders_ cracked down on illegal immigration and worked to cut wasteful government spending as Elon Musk and the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency targeted federal agencies and their employees.  A number of Democrats said this week they would boycott the speech_ as others planned to bring fired federal workers as their guests.  More than a dozen guests were invited to sit with first lady Melania Trump to highlight a number of Trump's policies.  The family of Corey Comperatore_ the firefighter killed by a gunman who tried to assassinate Trump during a campaign rally last July in Butler_ Pa._ is in the House chamber.  The mother and sister of Laken Riley_ the Athens_ Ga._ college student named for the Laken Riley Act and killed last year by a Venezuelan migrant_ are also in attendance.

Mother and advocate January Littlejohn_ who fought school administrators for allowing her daughter to transition without parental consent_ and former high school athlete Payton McNabb are also attending the president's speech.  While House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries_ D-N.Y._ urged Democrats attending Trump's address to have a "strong_ determined and dignified" presence_ there are reports some are planning to disrupt the speech with noisemakers_ signs or walkouts.  "The House as an institution belongs to the American people_ and as their representatives we will not be run off the block or bullied_" Jeffries said.  Other Democrats announced before the speech that they planned to boycott_ including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez_ D-N.Y.  "I'm not going to the Joint Address_" Ocasio-Cortez wrote Tuesday in a post on Bluesky. " I will be live posting and chatting with you all here instead."  Rep_ Don Beyer_ D-Va._ announced he would not attend Tuesday_ predicting Trump would "preen and gloat about his return to power and its abuses of that power."  "Meanwhile my constituents are seeing their livelihoods destroyed_ often illegally_" Beyer wrote in a post on X. "What he is doing is not normal_ it is not acceptable and I won't be attending."  Rep.

297002324,WASHINGTON — A sharply divided Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a Trump administration push to rebuke a federal judge who imposed a quick deadline to release billions of dollars in foreign aid.  By a 5-4 vote_ the court told U.S. District Judge Amir Ali to clarify his earlier order that required the Republican administration to release nearly $2 billion in aid for work that had already been done.  Justice Samuel Alito led four conservative justices in dissent_ saying Ali lacks the authority to order the payments. Alito wrote that he is stunned the court is rewarding “an act of judicial hubris.”  The court’s action leaves in place Ali’s temporary restraining order that had paused the spending freeze_ Ali is holding a hearing Thursday to consider a more lasting pause.  The majority noted that the administration had not challenged Ali’s initial order_ only the deadline.  The court told Ali to “clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order_ with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.”  The administration has argued that the situation has changed because it has replaced a blanket spending freeze with individualized determinations that led to the cancellation of 5_800 U.S. Agency for International Development contracts and another 4_100 State Department grants totaling nearly $60 billion in aid.  Ali ordered the funding temporarily restored on Feb. 13_ but nearly two weeks later he found the government was giving no sign of complying and set a deadline to release payment for work already completed.  The administration appealed_ calling Ali’s order “incredibly intrusive and profoundly erroneous” and protesting the timeline to release the money.
297005380,Ukrainian officials have confirmed the U.S. has partially suspended intelligence support to the country.  A Ukrainian intelligence official said the pause included a halt in sharing U.S. satellite imagery through the Defense Intelligence Agency.  A Ukrainian member of parliament closely involved in talks on U.S. defense cooperation also said the U.S. had stopped sharing intelligence data that could be used to launch attacks into Russia. It appears for now not all intelligence sharing has been halted.  The Ukrainian intelligence official said that Ukraine was still able to receive satellite imagery from European allies_ which have their own capabilities. Another Ukrainian member of parliament and former senior defense official said they hoped the pause would be temporary.  -ABC News' Patrick Reevell

The president's address_ which is not a State of the Union speech as it comes less than two months after assuming office_ was delivered Tuesday night to members of Congress_ U.S. Supreme Court justices_ members of Trump's Cabinet -- many of them already confirmed -- and invited guests inside the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol in Washington_ D.C.  President Trump entered the House chamber at 9:14 p.m. ET_ wearing a blue suit and purple tie_ to loud cheers and a standing ovation as he pumped his fist_ while the other half of the chamber remained seated with many booing his arrival. Others started chanting "USA_ USA" as Trump neared the podium to shake hands with Vance and Johnson.  First lady Melania Trump_ who was wearing a gray suit_ also received a standing ovation from half of the chamber as she entered and waved to those in attendance. Members of the Democratic Women's Caucus wore the color pink to honor the rights of women and to protest Trump's speech. "Pink is the color of power and protest_" according to Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández_ D-N.M.  Trump's speech_ titled "The Renewal of the American Dream_" was his first significant speech of his second non-consecutive term. Trump is the second president in U.S. history_ after Grover Cleveland_ to win non-consecutive terms in the White House.  During his speech_ Trump discussed government spending_ tariffs_ the border_ crime_ defense_ Russia's war in Ukraine_ Israel's war in Gaza_ U.S. health_ education_ inflation and the economy.  "Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families_" Trump said Tuesday. "As you know_ we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices_ pushed up the cost of groceries and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans."  "We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years_ but perhaps even in the history of our country. As president_ I am fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again_" Trump said to another standing ovation from Republicans as Democrats held signs that said "save Medicaid" and "Musk steals."  Trump addressed the high price of eggs_ saying "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control and we are working hard to get it back down."  The president discussed his plan to fight inflation by reducing the cost of energy and "drill baby_ drill_" in addition to cutting government waste through the Department of Government Efficiency as he introduced Elon Musk to loud cheers and boos.  Trump then began listing specific government programs that he called "waste."  "Scholarships in Burma_" and "$8 million for making mice transgender. This is real_" he said as he continued_ "$20 million for an Arab Sesame Street program" and "$59 million for luxury hotels for migrants in New York City."  "All of these scams have been found out and exposed and terminated by mostly young people headed up by Elon Musk_ and we appreciate it_" Trump said as half of the chamber stood up and cheered.  "We have taken back the money to reduce the debt and fight inflation_" Trump added_ as he began listing the millions of people on the Social Security payroll who are over the age of 150 years old.  "We are a much healthier nation than we thought_ right Bobby?" Trump quipped_ as he pointed to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.  The president's joint address to Congress drew strong reactions from both sides of the aisle as it fell on the same day the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.  "We pay subsidies to Canada and Mexico of hundreds of millions of dollars_ and the United States will not be doing that any longer_" Trump said_ as he touted new investments in the United States by SoftBank_ Apple and other large companies. And Trump announced he would implement reciprocal tariffs to begin on April 2nd_ because it is "only fair."  Trump's speech also comes amid stalled efforts to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine following a contentious White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and subsequent "pause" on military aid to Ukraine.  "I am also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict_ with no end in sight_" Trump said.  "The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense. Meanwhile_ Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine -- by far! And Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent_" Trump claimed.  "Earlier today_ I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. The letter reads 'Ukraine is ready to come back to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer_'" Trump announced to cheers. "It's time to stop this madness. It's time to stop the killing. It's time to end this war. If you want to end wars_ you have to talk to both sides."  Recently freed Russian prisoner Marc Fogle_ an American history teacher from Pennsylvania_ applauded Trump's announcement from the chamber with his 95-year-old mother_ Malphine Fogel_ who had asked Trump to help free her son before his Butler campaign rally last July.  The family of Corey Comperatore_ the firefighter killed by a gunman who tried to assassinate Trump during that Pennsylvania campaign rally_ was also in the House chamber.  "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch_ but some were not so lucky_" Trump said. "Corey was a firefighter_ a veteran_ a Christian_ a husband_ a devoted father_ and above all a protector_" as he threw himself over his wife and daughters to shield them from the gunfire. Trump also honored those injured in the attack.  More than a dozen guests were invited to sit with the first lady to highlight Trump's policies.  The mother and sister of Laken Riley_ the Athens_ Ga._ college student named for the Laken Riley Act and killed last year by a Venezuelan migrant_ were also in attendance.  "Laken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration_" Trump said as he introduced Laken's family and vowed to "insure their daughter would not have died in vain."  "It's called the Laken Riley Act_ so America will never forget_" Trump said as half of the chamber gave a standing ovation.  "Since taking office_ my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history and we quickly achieved the lowest border crossings ever recorded_" Trump announced to cheers_ again from half of the chamber.  "Democrats kept saying we need new legislation_ we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turns out that all we really needed was a new president_" Trump said to loud cheers.  "Joe Biden didn't just open our borders_ he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools_ hospitals and communities throughout the country_" Trump added. "Now we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there is still work to be done."  Alexis Nungaray_ the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray_ who was allegedly murdered by two migrants just weeks before her birthday_ was also in attendance.  "Earlier tonight I signed an order_ keeping my word to you. One thing I learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much_ she loved nature. Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston_ you'll find a magnificent wildlife refuge_" Trump said_ adding that "I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter Jocelyn."  Stephanie Diller_ the widow of New York Police Department officer Jonathan Diller who was killed during a traffic stop last year_ was in the chamber to hear Trump honor her husband.  "I have already signed a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer_" Trump announced as he honored Diller. "I'm also asking for a new crime bill to get tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers."  "In recent years_ our Justice system has been turned upside-down by radical left lunatics_" Trump said as he pointed to Democrats in chamber. "Many jurisdictions ceased enforcing the law against repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents_ like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair_ equal and impartial justice under the Constitutional rule of law_ starting at the FBI and DOJ."  "We are once again giving our police officers the support and respect they deserve_" Trump added. "This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country."  Trump also discussed plans to Make America Healthy Again_ as he introduced Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment_ poisons out of our food supply and keep our children healthy and strong_" Trump said. "My administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideology in our schools."  Mother and advocate January Littlejohn_ who fought school administrators for allowing her daughter to transition without parental consent_ also attended the president's speech_ as Trump called what happened to her daughter a "form of child abuse."  "Stories like this are why I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology_" Trump said. "And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children."  "Our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way that God made you_" Trump said to loud cheers. "Because we are getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military_" as he introduced Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.  Trump touted higher military recruiting numbers over the past month and announced he would ask Congress to fund a "start-of-the-art golden-dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland."  "Ronald Reagan wanted to do it years ago_ but the technology wasn't there_" he said.  The president also announced plans to increase ship building in the United States_ along with his goal to "reclaim the Panama Canal."  And Trump discussed the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and honored the 13 soldiers killed_ as he announced the United States had just apprehended the top terrorist "responsible for the atrocity_ and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice_" to which the president received another standing ovation.  Trump concluded his one-hour and 40-minute long speech with a look back at history.  "We stand on the shoulders of those pioneers who won and built the modern age. These workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities. The warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom_" Trump said. "We will fight_ fight_ fight for the country our citizens believe in."  "Now it is our time to take up the cause of American liberty and to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country_" Trump concluded.  Earlier_ House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries_ D-N.Y._ urged Democrats attending Trump's address to have a "strong_ determined and dignified" presence amid reported plans to disrupt the speech. Several Democrats were seen walking out of the chamber_ as others booed or sat silently.  Other Democrats announced before the speech that they would boycott_ including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez_ D-N.Y.  "I'm not going to the Joint Address_" Ocasio-Cortez wrote Tuesday in a post on Bluesky. " I will be live posting and chatting with you all here instead."  Rep_ Don Beyer_ D-Va._ announced he would not attend Tuesday_ predicting Trump would "preen and gloat about his return to power and its abuses of that power."  "Meanwhile my constituents are seeing their livelihoods destroyed_ often illegally_" Beyer wrote in a post on X. "What he is doing is not normal_ it is not acceptable and I won't be attending."  Rep. Gerry Connolly_ D-Va._ also boycotted Trump's speech "in solidarity" with federal government employees who have been fired over Trump's spending cuts_ saying_ "I cannot give audience to that."  Sen. Elissa Slotkin_ D-Mich._ a first-term senator_ delivered the Democratic response after Trump's speech concluded. Rep. Adriano Espaillat_ D-N.Y._ delivered the Spanish language response.
296788024,WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump vowed Tuesday to keep up his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” in reorienting the nation’s economy_ immigration and foreign policy in an unyielding address to Congress and the nation that left Democratic legislators to register their dissent with stone faces_ placards calling out “lies_” and one legislator’s ejection.  Trump’s prime-time speech was the latest marker in his takeover of the nation’s capital_ where the Republican-led House and Senate have done little to restrain the president as he and his allies work to slash the size of the federal government and remake America’s place in the world.  The more than 90-minute address added up to an defiant sales pitch for the policies that he promised during his campaign and leaned into during his first weeks back in office. Trump pledged to keep delivering sweeping changes to the country_ rescuing it from what he described as destruction and mistakes left by his predecessor while repeatedly needling Democratic lawmakers who protested his remarks.  Emboldened after overcoming impeachments in his first term and criminal prosecutions in between his two administrations and with a tight grip on the Republican-controlled Congress_ Trump has embarked on a mission to dismantle parts of the federal government_ remake the relationship with America’s allies and spark a North American trade war that is compounding economic uncertainty.  “It has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action_” Trump said of his opening weeks in office. “The people elected me to do the job_ and I am doing it.”  Trump_ who has billionaire adviser Elon Musk orchestrating his efforts to slash the size and scope of the federal government_ said he is working to “reclaim democracy from this unaccountable bureaucracy” and threatened federal workers anew with firings if they resist his agenda.  Musk_ who was seated in the House gallery_ received a pair of standing ovations from Republicans in the chamber_ as Trump exaggerated and shared false claims about alleged government abuse uncovered by the Tesla and SpaceX founder and his team of disrupters.  Trump repeated false claims that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments_ prompting some Democrats to shout_ “Not true!” and “Those are lies!”  Trump spoke at a critical juncture in his presidency_ as voters who returned him to the White House on his promise to fix inflation are instead finding economic chaos. All the gains the S&P 500 have made since Election Day are now gone_ while consumer sentiment surveys show the public sees inflation as worsening. For a president who believes that announcements of corporate investments can boost attitudes about the economy_ the speech was suddenly a test of his ability to rebuild confidence in his economic leadership.  Trump seemed prepared to double down on his trade war_ which experts have warned will raise prices for consumers.  “Whatever they tariff us_ we tariff them. Whatever they tax us_ we tax them_” Trump said. He sought to ease concerns about price increases_ saying_ “There’ll be a little disturbance_ but we’re okay with that. It won’t be much.”  Trump said one of his “very highest priorities” was to rescue the economy and offer relief to working families. He promised to organize the federal government to lower costs on eggs and energy_ blaming his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden for the situation and offering scant details of his own plans.  Trump also called for the extension of his first-term tax cuts and additional federal funding for his border crackdown_ including for his promised efforts at “mass deportation” of people in the U.S. illegally.  Speaking about his promised tax cuts_ Trump seemed to goad Democrats_ saying: “I’m sure you’re going to vote for those tax cuts. Because otherwise I don’t believe the people will ever vote you into office.”  The backdrop was the new economic uncertainty unleashed after the president opened the day by placing stiff tariffs on imports from the country’s neighbors and closest trading partners. A 25% tax on goods from Canada and Mexico went into effect early Tuesday — ostensibly to secure greater cooperation to tackle fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration — triggering immediate retaliation and sparking fears of a wider trade war. Trump also raised tariffs on goods from China to 20%.  Trump also celebrated his sharp crackdown on migration to the U.S._ fulfilling a key campaign promise and taunting Democrats for not doing more to secure the border_ saying_ “It turns all we really needed was a new president.”  Republicans were boisterous as Trump stepped to the lectern in the House_ chanting “USA! USA!” as the president basked in the cheers. The GOP lawmakers were jubilant_ having won a trifecta of the White House_ Senate and House in the elections. However_ they face a high-stakes task of delivering on Trump’s agenda as well as avoiding a government shutdown later this month.  Across the aisle_ out-of-power Democrats set the tone early_ with most remaining seated without applauding or making eye contact with Trump as he was introduced in the chamber.  After several interruptions_ House Speaker Mike Johnson jumped in and called for decorum to be restored in the chamber as Republicans shouted “USA” to drown out the cries from the other side of the aisle. Johnson then ordered Texas Rep. Al Green removed from the chamber.  “It’s worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up” to Trump_ Green told reporters after being thrown out of the chamber.  Other Democrats held up signs criticizing like “Save Medicaid” and “Protect Veterans” during Trump’s remarks_ seeking to drive public awareness to elements of Trump’s agenda they believed might offer them a pathway back to the majority.  Some Democrats chose to highlight the impact of Trump’s actions by inviting fired federal workers as guests_ including a disabled veteran from Arizona_ a health worker from Maryland and a forestry employee who worked on wildfire prevention in California. They also invited guests who would be harmed by steep federal budget cuts to Medicaid and other programs.  Trump also used his speech to address his proposals for fostering peace in Ukraine and the Middle East_ where he has unceremoniously upended the policies of the Biden administration in a matter of just weeks. On Monday_ Trump ordered a freeze to U.S. military assistance to Ukraine_ ending years of staunch American support for the country in fending off Russia’s invasion.  Many Democratic lawmakers wore blue and yellow ties and scarves in a show of support for Ukraine.  Trump also said he had ended a “weaponized government” that he accused Democrats of wielding against him_ referring to his legal troubles over the years_ claiming they were political persecution.  The president also used his high-profile moment to press his efforts to reshape the country’s approach to social issues_ as he looked to continue to eradicate diversity_ equity and inclusion efforts across the country and to roll back some public accommodations for transgender individuals.  Trump said he ended the “tyranny” of diversity_ equity and inclusion policies that he rolled back for the federal government and military_ along with pushing similar moves in the private sector. “Our country will be woke no longer_” he declared.  Watching from the gallery with first lady Melania Trump were guests including 15-year-old Elliston Berry_ of Aledo_ Texas_ who was the victim of an explicit deepfake image sent to classmates.  Other White House guests included Stephanie Diller_ the widow of New York Police Department Officer Jonathan Diller_ who was killed in the line of duty during a traffic stop in March 2024; Marc Fogel_ the Pennsylvania teacher who came home last month after years of detention in Russia_ and his 95-year-old mother_ Malphine; and relatives of Corey Comperatore_ the former Pennsylvania fire chief who was killed as he protected his family during an assassination attempt on Trump last summer.

296756414,Accused rapist and sex trafficker Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are under criminal investigation in Florida_ according to the state’s Attorney General James Uthmeier_ after the pair arrived in Fort Lauderdale last week.   “These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting_ trafficking_ preying upon women around the world_” Uthmeier told a reporter on Tuesday_ noting that some of the Tates’ accusers have been minors. “People can spin it however they want_” he said. “In Florida_ this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious.”   The Tates_ far-right manosphere influencers who face criminal charges related to an alleged human trafficking operation in Romania as well as potential extradition to the U.K. (they have denied all allegations)_ had been allowed to leave Europe and fly to the U.S. five days ago. This was reportedly thanks to the efforts of a Trump envoy_ Richard Grenell_ who negotiated with the Romanian government to lift travel restrictions on the siblings — outspoken supporters of the president — despite an active prosecution against them in the country. Trump has denied having any knowledge of the circumstances of the Tates’ newfound freedom of movement.   To the apparent displeasure of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis_ the Tates chose to return to his state. (They have dual citizenship in the U.S. and U.K.) Last Thursday_ in a press conference_ the governor claimed he had no prior knowledge of the brothers’ arrival and had learned about it through the media. “Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct_” he said_ alluding to the various allegations and charges against the Tates. DeSantis added that Uthmeier was exploring legal options to “deal with” their unexpected presence. The attorney general also announced that he had opened a “preliminary inquiry.”   The Tates’ prominent allies in MAGA world blasted DeSantis for the aforementioned response_ saying the self-styled “alpha male” figures were being unfairly targeted_ though other conservative commentators argued that the brothers were unfit ambassadors for right-wing ideology. The two brothers then seemed to resume life as usual_ on Tuesday releasing an installment of their “Tate Confidential” video series that depicted them relaxing around a pool at a luxury property. “First day of Freedom in Miami_” Andrew Tate wrote in an X post where he shared the footage.   Less than an hour later_ he was denouncing the Florida investigation. “Absolute communism_” he wrote in another post. “I am super disappointed in the United States. This isn’t the America I know. This is a sad sad day for America. Trying to find crimes on an innocent man.” Tristan Tate wrote_ in his own X post_ “Letitia James is after me_” making a cryptic reference to the attorney general of New York. James has not as yet announced any action against the Tates.   While the nature of Uthmeier’s criminal probe is not yet clear_ the brothers are presently in a legal battle with an American woman who sued them in Palm Beach County_ Florida_ last month. Identified as Jane Doe in court documents_ she has alleged that the Tates attempted to pull her into a webcam sex trafficking scheme. The brothers sued her for defamation in 2023 after she provided testimony to Romanian authorities. Her countersuit alleges they defamed her_ while her attorney_ Dani Pinter_ said she has been “relentlessly harassed_ threatened_ and sued for merely cooperating” with law enforcement in Romania. The civil suit is the first against the brothers in the U.S.   Just before landing in Florida_ the Tates filed for a temporary restraining order against Doe_ citing text messages that allegedly demonstrate “credible threats of violence_ intimidation or harm.” Pinter said that Doe had requested to pause her lawsuit after the brothers reentered the U.S._ but the court denied the motion.   Uthmeier was emphatic in his remarks Tuesday about going after the Tates. “We’re not going to accept it_” he said of their alleged crimes. “They chose to come here and set their feet down in this state_ and we’re going to pursue every tool we have within our legal authority to hold them accountable.”   Andrew Tate_ meanwhile_ continued to profess his innocence_ comparing himself to the man who reportedly aided his escape from Romania in the first place. “I didn’t commit any crime and they’re trying to find one because they don’t like me_” he wrote on X. “This is exactly what they did to president Trump.”

297173020,President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order_ possibly Thursday_ aimed at abolishing the Department of Education_ The Wall Street Journal reported. The newspaper cited several people briefed on the matter and reviewed a draft of the order. It directs newly sworn Education Secretary Linda McMahon to "take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Education Department" based on "the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law." DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CANCELS ANOTHER $350M IN 'WOKE' SPENDING FOR CONTRACTS_ GRANTS "The experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars—and the unaccountable bureaucrats those programs and dollars support—has failed our children_ our teachers_ and our families_" the draft order reads. Shortly after taking her position_ McMahon said she would "send education back to the states." Trump has long talked about dismantling the Department of Education_ saying it has failed America's students. "It’s a big con job_" the president said in November. "They ranked the top countries in the world. We’re ranked No. 40_ but we’re ranked No. 1 in one department: cost per pupil. So_ we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world_ but we’re ranked No. 40." DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LAUNCHES ‘ENDDEI’ PORTAL FOR PARENTS_ STUDENTS_ TEACHERS TO REPORT DISCRIMINATION In a letter to Democratic members of the Senate Committee on Health_ Education_ Labor and Pensions (HELP)_ McMahon said that she "wholeheartedly" agreed with Trump's plan to abolish the department.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "President Trump believes that the bureaucracy in Washington should be abolished so that we can return education to the states_ where it belongs. I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission_" McMahon wrote. Under McMahon_ the department will work from three base convictions_ according to her letter: that parents are the primary decision makers in their children’s education_ that taxpayer-funded education should refocus on "meaningful learning in math_ reading_ science_ and history—not divisive DEI programs and gender ideology_" and that post-secondary education should be a path to a well-paying career aligned with workforce needs.

297374810,Washington — The House is expected to vote Thursday morning to reprimand Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas for disrupting President Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Green suggested in a social media post Thursday morning that the outcome is a foregone conclusion."During the 10:00 hour ET_ Congressman Al Green will be censured this morning for standing up to President Trump_" Green wrote on X. Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington_ who introduced the resolution to censure Green_ said the move was not personal and called it a "difficult step." "We cannot ignore the willful disruption intended to stop a proceeding_" Newhouse_ who is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the Capitol riot_ said Wednesday. "Without decorum_ without respect_ what do we got? What do we have_ truly?" Newhouse said Green's behavior reflects on all members of Congress and the moment serves as a reminder "that we all need to raise our level of accountability." "This is truly a wakeup call for this chamber_" he said. "The lack of decorum has reached a new low. When the president of the United States cannot even come into our chamber invited and complete his speech without the interaction that we saw last night_ we have to take this action of censure." Before Green spoke during floor debate on the resolution Wednesday_ he walked over to Newhouse and shook his hand. Green said he did not hold any ill will toward House Speaker Mike Johnson_ who ordered his removal from the chamber during Mr. Trump's address_ the officers who escorted him out or those who supported his censure. "The president indicated that he had a mandate. I said to the president_ 'You do not have a mandate to cut Medicaid.' I have constituents who need Medicaid. They will suffer and some will die if they don't get Medicaid_" Green said of why he heckled Mr. Trump. "I would do it again." The resolution says Green's behavior "was a breach of proper conduct" and calls for him to stand in the well of the House while the resolution is read aloud. Minutes into Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday_ Green stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. Johnson_ a Louisiana Republican_ warned Green to take his seat and "maintain decorum_" but Green refused. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to "restore order" and "remove this gentleman from the chamber." Censure is essentially a formal reprimand by the House. In the last two years_ three other Democrats — Adam Schiff of California_ Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Jamaal Bowman of New York— have been censured. Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said Republicans have shown "selective outrage" in their condemnation of certain behavior. "I can't believe we're having this debate_" McGovern said Wednesday.

The premium will not increase as long as veterans keep the VALife policy. For example_ a veteran who is 18 when applying for the policy will pay $43.60 per month for the maximum $40_000 worth of coverage. A veteran who is 41 when applying will pay $91.20 a month for that maximum coverage.  Service members automatically receive Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance coverage of $500_000_ although they can elect to decline or reduce that coverage.   Currently about 2 million active duty_ reserve and National Guard members are insured under SGLI_ and pay a premium of $31 per month for $500_000 worth of coverage_ which is deducted from their pay. But that premium will be reduced in spring 2025 to $26 a month. SGLI is group term life insurance. The reduction will be automatic and requires no action to get the new rate.  The rate will change to 5 cents per $1_000 of insurance. The monthly premium includes $1 for Traumatic Injury Protection coverage (TSGLI).  SGLI coverage is offered in increments of $50_000. The monthly premium is the same regardless of the service member’s age or other factors.  If active duty service members want to decline or reduce coverage_ they can use the SGLI Online Enrollment System. Reservists with part-time SGLI coverage who want to reduce or decline their coverage should use Form SGLV 8286 and submit it to their personnel office.  For the approximately 870_000 active duty spouses covered under the Family SGLI program_ the premiums will also decrease between 11% and 22%_ depending on the spouse’s age_ with an average discount of 13%.  Dependent children are provided $10_000 worth of coverage_ at no cost.  Veterans who have insurance under the Veterans’ Group Life Insurance_ or VGLI_ program_ will also see a decrease in their premiums in the spring. The premiums will be reduced by between 2% to 17%_ depending on the age of the veteran. The average decrease will be about 11%. About 450_000 veterans are insured under VGLI.  There are certain time limits for purchasing VGLI policies after leaving the service_ so troops need to do some cost comparisons before hanging up their uniform. SGLI coverage doesn’t automatically carry over_ and VGLI is more expensive than SGLI.  More information about VA life insurance options is available at https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/options-eligibility
297424478,By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER_ AP Economics Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he has postponed 25% tariffs on most goods from Mexico for a month after a conversation with that country’s president.  Trump’s announcement comes after his Commerce Secretary_ Howard Lutnick_ said tariffs on both Canada and Mexico would “likely” be delayed. This is the second one-month postponement Trump has announced since first unveiling the import taxes in early February. The reprieve would apply to goods that are compliant with the trade agreement Trump negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term.  “We are working hard_ together_ on the Border_ both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and_ likewise_ stopping Fentanyl_” Trump said on Truth Social.  Trump’s on-again_ off-again tariffs threats have roiled financial markets_ lowered consumer confidence_ and enveloped many businesses in an uncertain atmosphere that could delay hiring and investment. Lutnick emphasized that reciprocal tariffs_ in which the United States applies import taxes on countries that tariff U.S. exports_ will still be implemented April 2.  U.S. markets bounced of their lows for the day shortly after Lutnick spoke.  Also Thursday_ Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated that he expects his country will be in a trade war with the United States for the foreseeable future.  Trudeau said the broader month-long pause “aligns with some of the conversations that we have been having with administration officials.”  The Canadian leader said the move by the Trump administration was a “promising sign_” but it also “means that the tariffs remain in place and therefore our response will remain in place.”  Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.
297163330,Folks_ it’s getting rough out here. Just days after the death of R&B/soul fixture Angie Stone_ Variety reports that jazz legend Roy Ayers has died at age 84. Ayers_ who primarily played the vibraphone_ was sometimes called “The Godfather of Neo Soul_” and was best known for his 1976 composition “Everybody Loves The Sunshine.” His legacy was kept alive through the late ’90s and early 2000s thanks to rappers’ penchants for sampling his works_ from Dr. Dre and The Notorious B.I.G. to Tyler The Creator_ Joey Badass_ and Larry June.  Ayers’ death was confirmed in a statement from his family_ which read: “It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist_ composer_ and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4_ 2025 in New York City after a long illness.”  The legendary jazzman’s career started in the 1960s and continued into the ’70s; it included dozens of albums_ along with the soundtrack for Blaxploitation classic_ Coffy_ which starred Pam Grier. Ayers continued to release albums into the mid-90s; his final release_ Mahogany Vibe_ came nearly a decade after its predecessor_ in 2004. Deep into the next decade-plus_ Ayers was a coveted collaborator of artists across disciplines_ working with house DJs_ neo-soul sirens_ and even video game developers; he hosted an in-game radio station in Grand Theft Auto IV. Ayers is survived by his wife Argerie_ and their children_ Mtume and Ayana Ayers.
297267610,Glastonbury has unveiled the first names for the 2025 edition of the festival_ with The 1975_ Olivia Rodrigo and Neil Young billed as headliners. View the lineup in full below.   The British group will top the Pyramid Stage for the first time on Friday (June 26)_ ahead of Rodrigo on Sunday’s closing night. Joined by his Chrome Hearts band_ Young will return to Worthy Farm in Somerset_ south west England for the second time following his last headline set at the site in 2009.   Loyle Carner_ The Prodigy_ and five-time BRIT winner Charli XCX are all set to close out proceedings on The Other Stage across the weekend (June 25-29).   Other newly-confirmed acts include Doechii_ Alanis Morissette_ Tate McRae_ Father John Misty_ Ezra Collective_ Lola Young_ RAYE_ Noah Kahan_ Biffy Clyro_ Gracie Abrams and Wolf Alice. See the full lineup below.   Rod Stewart_ meanwhile_ will perform in the coveted legends slot on the Sunday (June 29)_ having shared the news last November. The 79-year-old previously appeared at the festival as a headliner in 2002_ joining Coldplay and Stereophonics as bill-toppers that year.   Tickets for Glastonbury 2025 went on sale in November and were snapped up by punters in under an hour following the introduction of a new online queuing system. A resale traditionally takes place in early April_ which includes unpaid_ or unwanted_ tickets from people who have canceled their purchase. More details of this year’s resale are expected to arrive soon.   The 1975 have previously appeared twice at Glastonbury_ with an early afternoon slot on the Pyramid Stage in 2014 and then gracing The Other Stage two years later. Their headline booking arrives ahead of rumoured new music_ with frontman Matty Healy having told fans last February that a record was in the works.    Fans believed that Rodrigo would be one of the headliners due to her forthcoming U.K. touring commitments aligning – including a huge show at BST Hyde Park in London and two rescheduled Manchester gigs – with this year’s festival. The singer made her Glastonbury debut in 2022_ where she was joined on stage by Lily Allen for a sprightly rendition of “F–ck You.”   Canadian rocker Young announced in January that he would be headlining Glastonbury_ just days after he said that he would withdraw from the festival and called it a “corporate turn-off.” At the time_ Young did not expand on the reversal of his decision_ instead posting a brief statement to his website. “Due to an error in the information received_ I had decided to not play the Glastonbury festival_ which I have always loved_” it read. “Happily_ the festival is now back on our itinerary and we look forward to playing! Hope to see you there!”   Last year_ Glastonbury was headlined by Dua Lipa_ SZA and Coldplay. The latter became the first act to top the bill five times_ following headline performances in 2002_ 2005_ 2011 and 2016.

297843828,NEW YORK -- The Trump administration has cancelled $400 million worth of grants and contracts to Columbia University for "the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students_" according to the Justice Department_ the Department of Health and Human Services_ the Department of Education and the General Services Administration.  The Administration says that on March 3_ the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism_ which is comprised of components from each of the federal agencies_ notified Columbia's administration that "that it would conduct a comprehensive review of the university's federal contracts and grants in light of ongoing investigations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act_" according to a press release.  At the start of the Israel and Hamas conflict_ Columbia was a hotbed of protests that would often turn violent with at least one building being overtaken by demonstrators.  Columbia_ according to the Administration holds about $5 billion in federal grant and contracts.  "Freezing the funds is one of the tools we are using to respond to this spike in anti-Semitism. This is only the beginning_" said Leo Terrell_ Senior Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and head of the Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. "Cancelling these taxpayer funds is our strongest signal yet that the Federal Government is not going to be party to an educational institution like Columbia that does not protect Jewish students and staff."  In a statement_ a university spokesperson said the school said it was reviewing the announcement and would work to restore the funding.  "We take Columbia's legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combatting antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students_ faculty_ and staff_" the statement said.  This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.
297736874,The U.S. Department of Education could be headed for some major changes_ with President Trump expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the agency. Although the timing of such a move is unclear_ reports that is in the works are already raising questions for millions of parents_ students and taxpayers about the future of the Education Department and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled. What does the Department of Education do?In 1979_ President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:Disbursing billions in student loans each yearOperating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid_ or FAFSA_ which allows students to apply for loans_ grants and other college aidProviding funding to help poor and disabled students enrolled in K-12 schoolsEnsuring equal access to education through its Office of Civil RightsOperating the Pell grant program_ which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7_400 per year to attend collegeFunding public charter schoolsOverseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agenciesCollecting data on education and student outcomes_ from early to higher education The Department of Education is "primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom — it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom_" Peter Granville_ a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education_ told CBS MoneyWatch.One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning_ which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums_ the Education Department's role is primarily financial_ distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio. "Curriculum is handled by states and local governance — the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum_" Granville said. "The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender."For instance_ the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid_ or FAFSA_ which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans_ grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans_ including repayment programs. Additionally_ the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department_ describing it last month as "a big con job" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)One of the president's executive orders_ signed Jan. 30_ directed the Education Department to investigate "school choice programs_" saying that parents need "opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs." Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives_ as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools_ including Christian-based institutions.In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled "Our Department's Final Mission_" McMahon wrote that her goal is to "restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington." That echoes language from Project 2025_ the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation. "Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much_ if any_ impact on student outcomes_" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. "Eventually_ policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level_ closest to the affected families."Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate_ which is unlikely given the current makeup. However_ the Trump administration could make changes to the agency_ such as by cutting staff_ without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies_ such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department_ describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste. The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties_ such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights_ which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role. Under his administration_ the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of antisemitism_ and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women's teams_ according to the Associated Press.The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs_ which have been tied up in court cases_ experts say. Last month_ the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans_ according to Business Insider. What would happen to student loans?The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities_ student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department_ Granville noted. "If this is going to be a smooth handoff_ some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down_" he said. "The most logical destination is the Treasury_ but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff."Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a "new government corporation with professional governance and management." The blueprint calls for federal loans "to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department_ which would manage collections."Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans_ which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries_ and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans. "[T]here should be no loan forgiveness_" Project 2025 states. What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1_ allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid. "Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA_ and unless Congress creates a new law_ the FAFSA has to continue_" Granville said.Still_ it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled_ he added. What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools? Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs_ such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities_ smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions_ and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.During his campaign_ Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services_ before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.What do educators and Democrats say? There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans_ grants and other support_ experts say. Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families_ said Sen. Bernie Sanders_ an independent from Vermont. "That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void_" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. "In other words_ shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country."The American Federation of Teachers_ a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers_ said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency. "The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test_" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. "States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards_ as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions—from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates."She added_ "The Department of Education_ and the laws it is supposed to execute_ has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed."
297869800,Gene Hackman lived with his dead wife’s body for a full week before succumbing to complications from heart problems and Alzheimer’s disease_ officials revealed Friday.  Betsy Arakawa died of Hantavirus_ a rare flu-like disease linked to rats_ the Santa Fe officials said.  Arakawa’s last left her and Hackman’s home on Feb. 11 which was also the last time she sent out any communications_ according to Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza.  She died of the virus likely that day_ New Mexico Chief Medical Examiner Heather Jarrell said at a highly anticipated press conference Friday afternoon.  Hackman_ who had late stage Alzheimer’s likely died roughly a week after his wife from hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and from Alzheimer’s_ Jarrell said.  Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa found dead in their home  Gene Hackman’s home had ‘minuscule’ gas leak_ not believed to be a factor in mysterious deaths  Forensic expert’s theory surrounding the ‘unusual’ circumstances of Gene Hackman_ wife’s deaths  Gene Hackman and his wife tested negative for carbon monoxide_ sheriff says  Gene Hackman’s wife Betsy Arakawa ‘hadn’t called’ her dementia-plagued mom_ 91_ in months_ housekeeper says  Medications_ cellphones seized from Gene Hackman and wife’s home as investigation into their mysterious deaths continues  Gene Hackman died at least 9 days before his_ wife’s bodies found mummified at New Mexico home_ sheriff says  The bodies of Hackman_ 95_ and Arakawa_ 65_ were discovered by maintenance and security workers at their Santa Fe_ New Mexico_ mansion on Feb. 26.  The two-time Oscar winner was found in the mud room of the home near his cane and sunglasses while his pianist wife was discovered in a bathroom with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the counter.  One of their three dogs_ Zinnia_ was also found dead in a crate in the bathroom closet near Arakawa. Their two other dogs_ Bear_ a German Shepherd and Nikita_ an Akita-Shepherd mix survived and were found roaming inside and outside the property.  The couple’s bodies had begun decomposing and partially mummifying due to the dry air and high altitude of the area – located at the southern point of the Rocky Mountains.  The last detected activity on the “Hoosiers” star’s pacemaker registered on Feb. 17 – nine days before they were found – leading officials to believe that was likely when he died.  There were no external signs of trauma on their bodies nor signs of “foul play_” but their deaths were still deemed “suspicious” prompting a further probe_ authorities said in the days after their deaths.  Hackman and Arakawa_ who met in the 1980s and married in 1991_ had become notoriously private and insular and it was not uncommon for them to go long stretches without speaking to friends and family – so no alarm bells were raised by their lack of contact in the time after they died.  They also didn’t have any surveillance cameras inside their home to help piece together the circumstances surrounding their deaths_ but investigators say it appeared that Hackman had suddenly fallen.  Initially theories swirled that the duo may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning_ but testing of their remains appeared to prove otherwise. And a local gas company said they only found a “miniscule” gas leak coming from their stove_ which wouldn’t have been enough to kill them.  Officials also previously said they were trying to crack the code for their cell phones to look at their correspondence in an effort to put together a timeline leading up to their deaths.  Hackman – who has battled health issues – was last publicly seen going into a medical appointment in March 2024. He appeared gaunt and frail at the time.  His daughter_ Leslie Anne Allen_ 58 – whom he had with his ex-wife Faye Maltese – said she and her dad “were close” but said she hadn’t been in contact with him for months.  Hackman had three children in total_ all of whom he shared with Maltese.
297712026,Dolly Parton is mourning her late husband with music.  The country singer released a new song dedicated to Carl Dean on Friday_ titled_ “If You Hadn’t Been There.”  The Grammy winner_ 79_ shared the album art via Instagram_ which featured a throwback photo of the couple cuddled up.  Their signatures were included on the bottom_ reading_ “Dolly + Carl = [love].”  Parton wrote_ “Carl and I fell in love when I was 18 and he was 23_ and like all great love stories_ they never end.”  The songwriter_ who wed Dean in 1966 and renewed her vows with him 50 years later_ concluded_ “They live in memory and in song_ and I dedicate this to him.”  In the emotional ballad_ Parton sings_ “I wouldn’t be here / If you hadn’t been there.”  She praises her late partner with making her “dream more than [she] dared” and “always see[ing] the best in” her.  Additionally_ the actress reminisces on being “cradled” in Dean’s “loving arms.”  News broke on Monday of the 82-year-old’s death_ with Parton writing in a statement that “words can’t do justice” to their bond.  “Carl and I spent many wonderful years together_” she wrote. “Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.”  Three days later_ Parton again thanked her fans for their support during the loss_ which “meant the world” to her.  “He is in God’s arms now and I am okay with that_” the “Hannah Montana” alum told her social media followers Thursday. “I will always love you.”  While Dean was notoriously private_ he did gush about first laying eyes on his wife in a rare 2016 interview with “Entertainment Tonight.”  “My first thought was_ ‘I’m gonna marry that girl_’” he recalled. “My second thought was_ ‘Lord_ she’s good lookin’.'”   Dean called that moment “the day [his] life began_” gushing_ “I wouldn’t trade the last 50 years for nothing on this earth.”
297554882,References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient_ the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity_ equity and inclusion content_ according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.  The database_ which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP_ includes more than 26_000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.  One official_ who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public_ said the purge could delete as many as 100_000 images or posts in total_ when considering social media pages and other websites that are also being culled for DEI content. The official said it’s not clear if the database has been finalized.  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Donald Trump’s executive order ending those programs across the federal government.  The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities_ including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months — such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.  But a review of the database also underscores the confusion that has swirled among agencies about what to remove following Trump’s order.  Aircraft and fish projects are flagged  In some cases_ photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word “gay_” including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay_ which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima_ Japan_ during World War II.  Several photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion_ apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list_ seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish — including their weight_ size_ hatchery and gender.  In addition_ some photos of the Tuskegee Airmen_ the nation’s first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit_ were listed on the database_ but those may likely be protected due to historical content.  The Air Force briefly removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen soon after Trump’s order. That drew the White House’s ire over “malicious compliance_” and the Air Force quickly reversed the removal.  Many of the images listed in the database already have been removed. Others were still visible Thursday_ and it’s not clear if they will be taken down at some point or be allowed to stay_ including images with historical significance such as those of the Tuskegee Airmen.  Asked about the database_ Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement_ “We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive_ we instruct components accordingly.”  He noted that Hegseth has declared that “DEI is dead” and that efforts to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs erodes camaraderie and threatens mission execution.  Some images aren’t gone  In some cases_ the removal was partial. The main page in a post titled “Women’s History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters” was removed. But at least one of the photos in that collection about an all-female C-17 crew could still be accessed. A shot from the Army Corps of Engineers titled “Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month” was deleted.  Other photos flagged in the database but still visible Thursday included images of the World War II Women Air Service Pilots and one of U.S. Air Force Col. Jeannie Leavitt_ the country’s first female fighter pilot.  Also still visible was an image of then-Pfc. Christina Fuentes Montenegro becoming one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps’ Infantry Training Battalion and an image of Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves.  It was unclear why some other images were removed_ such as a Marine Corps photo titled “Deadlift contenders raise the bar pound by pound” or a National Guard website image called “Minnesota brothers reunite in Kuwait.”  Why the database?  The database of the 26_000 images was created to conform with federal archival laws_ so if the services are queried in the future_ they can show how they are complying with the law_ the U.S. official said. But it may be difficult to ensure the content was archived because the responsibility to ensure each image was preserved was the responsibility of each individual unit.  In many cases_ workers are taking screenshots of the pages marked for removal_ but it would be difficult to restore them if that decision was made_ according to another official_ who_ like the others_ spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that were not public.  A Marine Corps official said every one of its images in the database “either has been taken down or will be taken down.” The Marines are moving on the directive as fast as possible_ but as with the rest of the military_ very few civilian or contractor employees at the Pentagon can perform content removal_ the official said.  In the Marine Corps_ just one defense civilian is available to do the work. The Marine Corps estimates that person has identified at least 10_000 images for removal — and that does not count more than 1_600 social media sites that have not yet been addressed.  Many of those social media sites were military base or unit support groups created years ago and left idle. No one still has the administrative privileges to go in and change the content.  The Marine official said the service is going through each site and getting new administrative privileges so it can make the changes.  On Feb. 26_ the Pentagon ordered all the military services to spend countless hours poring over years of website postings_ photos_ news articles and videos to remove any mentions that “promote diversity_ equity and inclusion.”  If they couldn’t do that by Wednesday_ they were told to “temporarily remove from public display” all content published during the Biden administration’s four years in office.  AP reporters Nicholas Riccardi in Denver_ Christina Cassidy in Atlanta_ Will Weissert and Ayanna Alexander in Washington and Christine Fernando in Chicago contributed to this report.
297543002,Nearly two months after an explosion sent flaming debris raining down on the Turks and Caicos_ SpaceX launched another mammoth Starship rocket on Thursday_ but lost contact minutes into the test flight as the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke apart.  This time_ wreckage from the latest explosion was seen streaming from the skies over Florida. It was not immediately known whether the spacecraft’s self-destruct system had kicked in to blow it up.  The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off from Texas. SpaceX caught the first-stage booster back at the pad with giant mechanical arms_ but engines on the spacecraft on top started shutting down as it streaked eastward for what was supposed to be a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean_ half a world away. Contact was lost as the spacecraft went into an out-of-control spin.  Starship reached nearly 90 miles (150 kilometers) in altitude before trouble struck and before four mock satellites could be deployed. It was not immediately clear where it came down_ but images of flaming debris were captured from Florida_ including near Cape Canaveral_ and posted online.  The space-skimming flight was supposed to last an hour.  “Unfortunately this happened last time too_ so we have some practice at this now_” SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot said from the launch site.  SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced “a rapid unscheduled disassembly” during the ascent engine firing. “Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses_” the company said in a statement posted online.  Starship didn’t make it quite as high or as far as last time.  NASA has booked Starship to land its astronauts on the moon later this decade. SpaceX’s Elon Musk is aiming for Mars with Starship_ the world’s biggest and most powerful rocket.  Like last time_ Starship had mock satellites to release once the craft reached space on this eighth test flight as a practice for future missions.

297603272,SEOUL_ South Korea -- A South Korean court ordered impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol to be released from jail_ according to news reports Friday.  The Yonhap News Agency reported that the Seoul Central District Court made the ruling Friday. Other South Korean media carried similar reports.   The court didn’t immediately confirm the reports.  Yoon was arrested in January in connection with his Dec. 3 martial law decree.  Investigators have alleged that the decree amounted to rebellion. If he’s convicted of that offense_ he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.  Yoon was separately impeached by lawmakers in December_ leaving it to the Constitutional Court to decide whether to formally end Yoon's presidency or reinstate him.  If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon’s impeachment_ he will be officially thrown out of office and a national election will be held to choose his successor within two months.
297787374,President Donald Trump threatened to impose "large scale" sanctions against Russia after the country carried out a massive attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. In a post on Truth Social_ President Trump said he was "strongly considering" sanctions and tariffs "until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached." National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters that Trump is ready to use carrots or sticks" to bring both Russia and Ukraine to the table. When asked by Fox News Channel Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich for more details on what could be sanctioned_ Hassett simply said there are "a heck of a lot of things." In the overnight attack_ Russia reportedly fired 67 missiles and 194 drones in an overnight attack that hit Ukraine’s energy and gas infrastructure_ Reuters reported_ citing Ukraine’s air force. According to reports_ at least 10 people were injured in Russia’s attack_ including a child. ZELENSKYY CONFIRMS UKRAINE WILL ATTEND AMERICA-LED PEACE TALKS DAYS AFTER OVAL OFFICE CLASH "Russia continues its energy terror_" Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. "Again energy and gas infrastructure in various regions of Ukraine has come under massive missile and drone fire." Russia has attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure multiple times throughout the three-year war. In April 2024_ Russia destroyed one of Ukraine's largest power plants_ and in December 2024_ Russia pummeled Ukraine's power grid. President Trump also included a message to both Ukraine and Russia in his Truth Social post: "Get to the table right now_ before it is too late." SECRETARY OF STATE RUBIO VOWS DIPLOMACY ATTEMPTS WILL CONTINUE IN EFFORT TO END RUSSIA'S WAR IN UKRAINE Friday’s attack seemed to be in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirming that his team would participate in peace talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia next week. While Zelenskyy himself will not be at the meeting_ his team will sit with their American counterparts to discuss ending the war. In his announcement of Ukraine’s participation in the talks_ Zelenskyy said his country is "most interested in peace." The issue of peace caused friction between Trump and Zelenskyy_ after the president said his Ukrainian counterpart was "not ready for peace" following their Oval Office spat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace_" Trump wrote on Truth Social last week after the heated meeting. However_ things seemed to have smoothed over between the two leaders_ with Trump reading a letter from Zelenskyy during his address to a joint session of Congress. Trump said he appreciated Zelenskyy’s letter and that he wants to see the "savage conflict" end. Fox News Channel's Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.
297827500,The Toronto Maple Leafs have been involved in a ton of trade rumors leading into the 2025 NHL Trade Deadline. However_ now that the day is here_ the pressure began to mount for them to turn rumor into reality. They have done just that with their first move of the day involving Scott Laughton and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Maple Leafs are acquiring Laughton in a trade with the Flyers_ as first reported by The Fourth Period’s David Pagnotta. The Flyers are also retaining 50% of Laughton’s cap hit_ according to multiple reports. In return_ the Maple Leafs are trading Nikita Grebenkin and a first to Philadelphia. Toronto receives two mid-round picks in this deal_ as well. The first-round pick heading to Philadelphia in this trade is for 2027. However_ it is not a straight first-rounder. The pick is top-10 protected. If Toronto winds up in the top 10 of the 2027 NHL Draft order_ the Flyers will receive this pick in 2028. The Maple Leafs have sought to add center depth throughout this process. Toronto has Auston Matthews serving as the first-line center. But their overall depth is not as great as they’d like it to be. Laughton helps give them more bodies down the middle of the ice. The 30-year-old Laughton is not a rental option for Toronto. He is signed through next season at a $3 million salary. However_ the Maple Leafs are only on the hook for $1.5 million of this figure. Laughton had spent his entire career with Philadelphia prior to this trade. The 30-year-old recently turned in a career-best season_ scoring 43 points in 2022-23. This season_ he has 11 goals and 27 points in 60 games for the Flyers. The Maple Leafs are gearing up for a run at the Stanley Cup. There is still work to do before the 2025 NHL Trade Deadline passes. However_ this trade is a big step for Toronto as they try to stack up with other contenders in the East.
297530184,(AP) — Nearly two months after an explosion sent flaming debris raining down on the Turks and Caicos_ SpaceX launched another mammoth Starship rocket on Thursday_ but lost contact minutes into the test flight as the spacecraft came tumbling down.  The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off from Texas a little before sunset. SpaceX caught the first-stage booster back at the pad with giant mechanical arms_ but engines on the spacecraft on top started shutting down as it streaked eastward for what was supposed to be a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean_ half a world away. Contact was lost with the spacecraft as it went into an out-of-control spin.  The space-skimming flight was supposed to last an hour and couldn’t release the mock satellites into space as planned. The spacecraft reached nearly 90 miles (150 kilometers) in altitude before trouble struck. It was not immediately clear where it came down.  “Unfortunately this happened last time too_ so we have some practice at this now_” SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot said from the launch site.  NASA has booked Starship to land its astronauts on the moon later this decade. SpaceX’s Elon Musk is aiming for Mars with Starship_ the world’s biggest and most powerful rocket.  Like last time_ Starship had four mock satellites to release once the craft reached space on this eighth test flight as a practice for future missions. They resembled SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellites_ thousands of which currently orbit Earth_ and were meant to fall back down following their brief taste of space.  Starship’s flaps_ computers and fuel system were redesigned in preparation for the next big step: returning the spacecraft to the launch site just like the booster.  During the last demo_ SpaceX captured the booster at the launch pad_ but the spacecraft blew up several minutes later over the Atlantic. No injuries or major damage were reported.  According to an investigation that remains ongoing_ leaking fuel triggered a series of fires that shut down the spacecraft’s engines. The on-board self-destruct system kicked in as planned.  SpaceX said it made several improvements to the spacecraft following the accident_ and the Federal Aviation Administration recently cleared Starship once more for launch.  Starships soar out of the southernmost tip of Texas near the Mexican border. SpaceX is building another Starship complex at Cape Canaveral_ Florida_ home to the company’s smaller Falcon rockets that ferry astronauts and satellites to orbit.

297987024,At least 12 people were injured in a shooting at a pub in Toronto and the suspect remained at large_ police said early on Saturday.  Four victims had non-life-threatening injuries and the extent of injuries to the rest was not known_ the police said in a post on X that did not describe the suspect.  “I am deeply troubled to hear reports of a shooting at a pub in Scarborough_” Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow posted on X_ adding that the police chief had assured her “all necessary resources have been deployed.”  Toronto paramedics told Canada’s CP24 Media the injuries ranged from minor to critical.
297899934,By JEFFREY COLLINS_ Associated Press  COLUMBIA_ S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina man convicted of murder was executed by firing squad Friday_ the first U.S. prisoner to die by that method in 15 years.  Three volunteer prison employees used rifles to carry out the execution of Brad Sigmon_ 67_ who was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m.  Sigmon killed his ex-girlfriend’s parents with a baseball bat in their Greenville County home in 2001 in a botched plot to kidnap their daughter. He told police he planned to take her for a romantic weekend_ then kill her and himself.  Sigmon’s lawyers said he chose the firing squad because the electric chair would “cook him alive_” and he feared that a lethal injection of pentobarbital into his veins would send a rush of fluid and blood into his lungs and drown him.  The details of South Carolina’s lethal injection method are kept secret in South Carolina_ and Sigmon unsuccessfully asked the state Supreme Court on Thursday to pause his execution because of that.  On Friday_ Sigmon wore a black jumpsuit with a hood over his head and a white target with a red bullseye over his chest.  The armed prison employees stood 15 feet from where he sat in the state’s death chamber — the same distance as the backboard is from the free-throw line on a basketball court. Visible in the same small room was the state’s unused electric chair. The gurney used to carry out lethal injections had been rolled away.  The volunteers all fired at the same time through openings in a wall. They were not visible to about a dozen witnesses in a room separated from the chamber by bullet-resistant glass. Sigmon made several heavy breaths during the two minutes that elapsed from when the hood was placed to the shots being fired.  The shots_ which sounded like they were fired at the same time_ made a loud_ jarring bang that caused witnesses to flinch. His arms briefly tensed when he was shot_ and the target was blasted off his chest. He appeared to give another breath or two with a red stain on his chest_ and small amounts of tissue could be seen from the wound during those breaths.  A doctor came out about a minute later and examined Sigmon for 90 seconds before declaring him dead.  Witnesses included three family members of the victims_ David and Gladys Larke. Also present were Sigmon’s attorney and spiritual advisor_ a representative from the prosecuting solicitor’s office_ a sheriff’s investigator and three members of the news media.  Sigmon delivered a closing statement that he said was “one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to help us end the death penalty.”  The firing squad is an execution method with a long and violent history in the U.S. and around the world. Death in a hail of bullets has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies_ as frontier justice in America’s Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.  Since 1977 only three other prisoners in the U.S. have been executed by firing squad. All were in Utah_ most recently Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. Another Utah man_ Ralph Menzies_ could be next; he is awaiting the result of a hearing in which his lawyers argued that his dementia makes him unfit for execution.  In South Carolina on Friday_ a group of protesters holding signs with messages such as “All life is precious” and “Execute justice not people” gathered outside the prison before Sigmon’s execution.  Supporters and lawyers for Sigmon asked Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to commute his sentence to life in prison. They said he was a model prisoner trusted by guards and worked every day to atone for the killings and also that he committed the killings after succumbing to severe mental illness.  But McMaster denied the clemency plea. No governor has ever commuted a death sentence in the state_ where 46 other prisoners have been executed since the death penalty resumed in the U.S. in 1976. Seven have died in the electric chair and 39 others by lethal injection.  In the early 2000s_ South Carolina was among the busiest death penalty states_ carrying out an average of three executions a year. But officials suspended executions for 13 years_ in part because they were unable to obtain lethal injection drugs.  The state Supreme Court cleared the way to resume them in July. Freddie Owens was the first to be put to death_ on Sept. 20_ after McMaster denied him clemency. Richard Moore was executed on Nov. 1 and Marion Bowman Jr. on Jan. 31.  Going forward the court will allow an execution every five weeks.  South Carolina now has 28 inmates on its death row including two who have exhausted their appeals and are awaiting execution_ most likely this spring. Just one man has been added to death row in the past decade.  Before executions were paused_ more than 60 people faced death sentences. Many of those have either had their sentences reduced to life or died in prison.
297937176,One Newark police officer was killed and another is “fighting for his life” in critical condition after a shootout with a 14-year-old suspect Friday evening_ according to reports.  Shots rang out around 6:30 p.m. near a White Castle and McDonald’s where the teen was hanging out with friends_ ABC7 reported_ citing the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office.  The young gunman allegedly fired a total of 29 shots at officers_ sources told PIX11.  Both officers were hit in the flurry of bullets and were taken to University Hospital_ ABC7 reported.   The injured officer is in critical condition and is “fighting for their life_” the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association said in a statement.   There are conflicting reports about the status of the teen_ with PIX 11 sources saying he was killed_ while ABC 7 reported he was taken into custody.   The suspect was hanging with a large group at the fast-food restaurants just before the incident_ but it is not clear what led to the shootout_ according to ABC 7.  “I have been updated on an incident that took place in Newark earlier tonight involving two officers that were shot_” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on X.  “This is a rapidly developing situation. Please pray for these officers_ their families_ and all our men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line to keep us safe.”  The New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police also commented on the senseless shooting.  “The FOP New Jersey State Lodge_ is saddened to announce that two brave_ hero police officers_ of the Newark Police Department were shot in the line of duty this evening. One Officer has made the ultimate sacrifice. More information to come_” the agency wrote on X.  Newark Police have taken multiple people into custody in relation to the shooting_ ABC7 reported_ citing sources.  The Post has reached out to the Newark Police Department and Essex County Prosecutor’s Office for comment.

Drumroll_ please...  🟨 Faux: Artificial_ fake_ imitation_ mock 🟩 Washing machine cycles/settings: Bulky_ cotton_ delicate_ spin 🟦 Words said frequently in the "Bill and Ted" movies: Bogus_ dude_ excellent_ totally 🟪 ____ Box: Chatter_ juke_ shadow_ soap Bogus and dude to start today and was thinking of skaters_ mostly because I am excited for the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4 remake (mostly 3 as that was my entry). Excellent and totally were easy find from that point. I spotted the green bulky_ spin and delicate next before seeing cotton but left it alone thinking it wouldn't be purple. With the remaining 8_ fake_ imitation and artificial made me think of imitation crab (ugh) and got me to snag mock. Which I saved again. This left chatter_ juke_ shadow and soap that I put in to get the purple. To be honest_ I didn't see the box connection until I put it in_ but it makes sense. Better than yesterday's rotten fruit group. I wrapped it up with green then yellow to close out the puzzle. Yesterday's Connections answers  🟨 Emblem: Label_ mark_ seal_ stamp 🟩 Subjects of acclaimed musical biopics: Brown_ Cash_ Dylan_ Mercury 🟦 U.S. cities: Buffalo_ Helena_ Irving_ Phoenix 🟪 Fruits with their second letters changed: Ample_ dote_ lumon_ poach Reading this in a later time zone? Here are the Connections answers for game #635_ which had a difficulty rating of 4.3 out of 5_ according to the Connections Companion.  Today was hard and most of it I did to myself_ except the purple group which can rot. I think the Connections makers were going for a Severance trap but I only clicked on that at the end of the solve. So maybe watch out for that. Kicked it off with the yellow group of label_ mark_ seal and stamp. Weirdly_ I took a strike on green when I had Brown_ Cash and Dylan but was not seeing Mercury_ despite Queen being my preferred act out of that group_ even if acclaimed is doing some heavy lifting on that awful biopic. I had Irving in there instead. Irving is what threw me throughout this puzzle because I totally forgot about Irving_ Texas despite having been there. I finally saw Mercury for who it was and got the green. Blue I picked up because I had to put Irving somewhere and the last four words didn't make sense for anything else. And we had purple with ample (apple)_ dote (date)_ lumon (lemon) and poach (peach). Which sucks. I genuinely hated this grouping and have no sound reasoning to back it up.

297911146,To kick off a busy weekend across the English Premier League_ two clubs battling for a spot in the UEFA Champions League meet up on Saturday as Nottingham Forest plays host to Manchester City.  Watch the Premier League on FuboTV (7-day free trial) and Peacock  If you told someone last summer that Nottingham Forest would be above the three-time defending EPL champions in Manchester City as March begins_ they would have thought you were crazy.  Yet_ here we are.  It has been a magical season for the Trees. Outside of a few lapses here and there_ the club has been pretty efficient in garnering points. They lost a tough battle to Newcastle United a couple of weeks ago_ but responded with a hard-fought draw against second-place Arsenal in their latest league contest. Nottingham comes into the weekend with momentum after advancing to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup.  ManCity has been up and down all season. While they picked up solid wins over Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur_ they were basted by both Liverpool and Arsenal. Yet_ they still have a chance to qualify for next year’s Champions League.  Currently_ Nottingham Forest is third in the EPL_ one point above Manchester City who are in fourth.  ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE  Nottingham Forest FC (14-6-7) vs. Manchester City FC (14-5-8)  When: Saturday_ March 8  Time: 7:30 a.m. ET  Where: The City Ground (Nottingham_ U.K.)  Channel: USA Network_ Universo  Stream: FuboTV (Free trial)_ Sling_ DirecTV Stream_ Peacock  Check out the EPL table and results here
297911550,The Las Vegas Raiders improved the quarterback position after making a trade with the Seattle Seahawks for Geno Smith. The move reunites Smith with head coach Pete Carroll_ as the two worked together in Seattle from the 2020 to 2023 seasons. Quarterback was deemed a major need for the Raiders after playing Gardner Minshew and Aidan O’Connell last season. It was unclear until now what the franchise planned to do. After acquiring the 34-year-old quarterback_ star edge rusher Maxx Crosby shared his response almost immediately after the deal was announced. An ecstatic Crosby shared the phrase “LFG” with some pirate flags. It’s safe to say the 27-year-old pass rusher is happy with the Raiders’ trade for Smith. Smith has had a roller coaster of a career in the NFL_ but recent years have proven to be great for him. He struggled mightily with the New York Jets after being drafted by them in the 2013 NFL Draft. Throughout his career_ Smith also played for the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers before becoming the backup quarterback in Seattle in 2020. In 2022_ Smith won the starting job for the Seahawks over Drew Lock and has been a decent option under center since then. He finished the 2024 season with 4_320 passing yards (career-high)_ 23 total touchdowns_ and 15 interceptions with an impressive 70.4% completion percentage. Comparing those numbers to the Raiders’ quarterback group last season_ Las Vegas should have an upgrade at the position. Minshew and O’Connell combined for 3_625 passing yards_ 18 total touchdowns_ and 14 interceptions. They also combined for a 65.0% completion percentage. Acquiring Smith gives the Raiders a starting quarterback for the 2025 season. But at the very least_ the position is less of a dire need than it was when the offseason first began. Additionally_ his chemistry with Carroll should translate over in Las Vegas and help the team improve overall.
297978976,Nikola Jokic regularly produces historic numbers. He outdid himself this time.  Jokic became the first player in NBA history to amass 30 points_ 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a game_ then he blew past that to finish with 31_ 21 and 22 as the Nuggets survived Phoenix in a 149-141 overtime thriller Friday at Ball Arena.  Regulation ended in chaos. Devin Booker gave Phoenix its first lead since the first quarter with 1:35 to go_ capping an 8-0 run. The Nuggets failed twice to score_ but Michael Porter Jr. wrestled away a steal from Mason Plumlee under the basket with 33.3 seconds left_ scoring off the glass to tie the game. Denver got a stop then ran pick-and-roll between Jamal Murray and Jokic for the win. But the topic of who takes the last shot for the Nuggets is more nuanced than that.  Christian Braun was the open man at the top of the key after Phoenix sold out to stop Jokic on the roll. So the ball found Braun. His 3-pointer with 1.4 seconds remaining was the shot of his NBA career_ until the Nuggets lost Kevin Durant in the weak-side corner on Phoenix’s last-gasp out of bounds play. The future Hall of Famer cashed in at the buzzer.  Overtime was simpler. Jokic_ Murray and Braun scored the first seven points_ and all that was left was for Jokic to cement a historic stat line. He did it with 1:18 to go_ finding a cutting Michael Porter Jr. for his 20th assist. Then he added two more assists on Denver’s next two possessions.  The three-time MVP tied his career-high with his 29th triple-double of the season. He secured this one with 10:22 remaining in the third quarter. If he plays all 19 remaining regular-season games_ he’s on pace to finish with 39_ which would be three shy of Russell Westbrook’s all-time single-season record.  Jokic has also assisted 15 or more baskets in 10 games this season. His 22 were a career-high. It helped that none of his teammates could miss against Phoenix’s bottom-five defense. Aaron Gordon set the tone with Denver’s wildest heat check of the season. He made four outside shots in the first six minutes_ pulling up from the wings and infecting his teammates with the same confidence. All eight players who saw the floor for Denver made at least one 3-pointer. Porter_ ironically_ was the last to do so. The Nuggets made 21 of 40 shots beyond the arc as a team.  They assisted on 45 of 57 made shots from the field.  But their defense worsened throughout the night. Booker got hot after a scoreless first quarter_ amassing 34 points on 19 shots. Braun fouled him on a jumper to hand Phoenix a 4-point play with 5:13 to go_ narrowing the gap to 117-112. Earlier in the fourth_ Michael Malone had lost his patience with his second unit as the Suns paraded to the foul line_ sending Jokic to the table with 9:01 left.  Braun went for 25 points_ five rebounds and five assists on an 8-of-11 shooting night. Gordon matched a career-high with seven 3s_ scoring 27 points. Each of Denver’s starters tallied at least 16 points on 50% shooting or better.  Former Nuggets two-way guard Collin Gillespie appeared in his 14th game this season for Phoenix_ fresh off a heroic 10-point fourth quarter Tuesday that shepherded the Suns back from down 19.  “I think there were a lot of guys in that locker room that were really happy for Collin_” Malone said pregame. “… What really resonated was the comments after the (Suns vs. Clippers) game from a guy like Kevin Durant. … After that previous loss_ Collin was one of the loudest voices in that locker room. Here’s a guy who’s on a two-way contract with some of the biggest stars in the game_ and Collin is a natural-born leader. So obviously_ we love him. We miss him. We’re happy when he has success against other teams.”  Peyton Watson_ in his second game back from a knee sprain that sidelined him for all of February_ contributed 11 points and a block off the bench. Malone played him at the two in one huge lineup that deployed Porter_ Zeke Nnaji and Jokic as its frontcourt.
297903542,Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Linkedin  Actor Gene Hackman and his wife_ Betsy Arakawa_ had their cause of deaths shared by New Mexico health officials Friday_ with Hackman dying of a form of heart disease and Arakawa dying of hantavirus—marking a rare case of the disease typically spread through rodents.  Actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa pose for a portrait in 1986 in Los Angeles_ California. ... [+] (Photo by Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) Getty Images  Dr. Heather Jarrell_ chief medical examiner in the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator_ said Friday that Arakawa_ 65_ died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome_ a “severe and potentially fatal disease” affecting the lungs_ according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Investigators said there were signs of rodent entry in some parts of the property Hackman and Arakawa lived on_ though they were not able to conclude how exactly Arakawa contracted the virus.  Hackman’s cause of death was heart disease_ specifically hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease_ which is characterized by high blood pressure and plaque buildup in the arteries.

How Is Hantavirus Contracted?  The serious family of viruses is contracted by contact with rodents such as rats and mice_ according to the CDC_ which noted rodent urine_ droppings and saliva could lead to infection. Rodent bites and scratches can rarely cause infection. The Mayo Clinic says the most common carrier of hantaviruses in North America is the deer mouse_ though different strains of the virus family are carried by different animals.  What Are The Early Signs Of Hantavirus?  Early signs of hantavirus are characterized by flu-like symptoms such as fever_ headache_ muscle aches_ nausea_ and fatigue_ the CDC reported_ noting the symptoms are “easily confused” with the flu.  What Are Hantavirus’ Symptoms?  Hantaviruses can cause two syndromes: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The first syndrome_ which was Arakawa’s cause of death_ has symptoms such as fatigue_ fever_ muscle aches in large muscle groups_ headaches_ dizziness_ chills_ nausea_ diarrhea and abdominal pain_ all of which can show anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure to an infected rodent. Late symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome include coughing_ shortness of breath and chest tightness as lungs fill with fluid. HFRS symptoms usually start one to two weeks after exposure and can initially include intense headaches_ back and abdominal pain_ fever_ chills_ nausea and blurred vision. Later symptoms_ according to the CDC_ include low blood pressure_ lack of blood flow_ internal bleeding and acute kidney failure. Recovery can take several weeks to months.  How Serious Is Hantavirus?  Some 38% of people who develop respiratory symptoms may die from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome_ the CDC reported. New Mexico state public health veterinarian Erin Phipps said Friday 42% of the state’s cases have been fatal.  Is Hantavirus Rare?  Yes—very. The CDC has recorded just 864 cases between 1993_ when the disease was first surveilled_ and 2022. Most of the cases through 2022 have been reported in New Mexico (122)_ Colorado (119)_ Arizona (86) and California (78)_ according to the CDC_ which reported 94% of hantavirus infections have occurred west of the Mississippi River. New Mexico has identified between one and seven hantavirus infections in people annually through the end of 2024_ according to Phipps. Surveillance of the disease began after a 1993 outbreak near the Four Corners_ where Arizona_ New Mexico_ Colorado and Utah meet.  How Is Hantavirus Diagnosed?  The CDC says it is difficult to diagnose a person infected with the virus for less than three days. Initial tests conducted before the virus can be found are repeated three days after symptoms start. The CDC says people who suspect they have hantavirus should “see a physician immediately and mention a potential rodent exposure.”  Is There A Treatment For Hantavirus?  No_ there is no specific treatment for the illness_ according to the Mayo Clinic_ which notes the best protection patients have is to “avoid contact with rodents and safely clean up rodent habitats.”  Key Background  Hackman and Arakawa’s deaths last month were initially considered “suspicious” by authorities_ as the two were found dead together in their home. Hackman_ 95_ was found on the floor in the home’s mud room and Arakawa was found lying on her side in a bathroom with unspecified pills scattered on a nearby counter_ according to a search warrant affidavit reviewed by ABC News. Officials later found they both tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. Investigators have said it is likely Arakawa died first_ as Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Hackman was likely home with his deceased wife for several days_ noting the actor’s “advanced” Alzheimer’s made him unaware of her death.

298179866,Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy is walking free after authorities declined to press charges in the wake of his shocking arrest on Friday.   Worthy was arrested for allegedly strangling a ‘family or household member’ in the Austin suburb of Georgetown_ but the Williamson County District Attorney Shawn Dick told the Statesman that his office is not accepting the case.   In a statement_ Dick said: ‘After further investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office and further discussion with a third-party witness_ Mr. Worthy and his attorneys_ this case is being declined at this time pending completion of the investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office.  ‘Mr. Worthy and his lawyers are fully cooperating with this investigation. We will continue to evaluate the case. As is our practice with all declines_ should you develop additional information indicative of probable cause in this case_ our office will consider that information and may present the case at that time to a Williamson County Grand Jury.’  Worthy could have faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted on the charge of ‘assault against a family or household member by impeding breathing or circulation’_ a third-degree felony.   Still just 21_ Worthy has been engaged to sprinter Tia Jones since last July. The couple has since revealed they bought a home together in Williamson County_ Texas_ although it’s unclear if that’s where Friday’s alleged incident is said to have taken place.   A former Texas Longhorns star and famed speedster_ Worthy was a first-round pick of the Chiefs in 2024 before catching 59 passes for 638 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie. Furthermore_ he had a touchdown catch in the AFC Championship win over the Buffalo Bills and two more in a Super Bowl defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Chiefs spokespeople told DailyMail.com on Saturday that the team is ‘aware’ of the arrest and is now ‘gathering information.’ DailyMail.com has also reached out Worthy’s representatives at Creative Artists Agency for comment.   It has been reported that Worthy was still in a Williamson County jail as of 5:50pm local time on Saturday night.  The DA’s office told the Statesman that ‘it could take a few hours for the decision to process’ and for him to be released.   In the wake of the arrest_ Worthy accused his partner of infidelity and an extortion plot.  ‘We are aware of the allegation that led to Mr. Worthy’s arrest_’ read a statement from his attorneys_ Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett_ who have denied the charge against their client. ‘We are working with law enforcement in Williamson County to ensure they have the benefit of the totality of circumstances that led to this allegation.  ‘The complainant was recently asked to vacate Mr. Worthy’s residence upon discovery of her infidelity. She has refused to do so and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy.’  A 24-year-old from Pflugerville_ Texas_ Jones is an adidas-sponsored athlete specializing in the 100-meter hurdles. She also competes in the 100-meter and 200-meter events as well.   This marks the second consecutive offseason in which a Chiefs receiver has found himself in legal trouble in Texas.  Rashee Rice was speeding a Lamborghini Urus through Dallas-area highways in March of 2024 when he and other cars being driven by his associates were involved in a hit-and-run crash.   Viral videos later showed Rice fleeing on foot from the scene of the crash.  A report by WFAA revealed that 10.8 grams of marijuana were found by police in the Lamborghini_ which is a Class B misdemeanor in Texas.  Despite this_ as well as a civil lawsuit in the case and a separate assault charge that was later dropped_ Rice did not face any punishment from the NFL in 2024.  However_ the Chiefs didn’t know Rice would go unpunished in the case at the time of Aprils draft. And with Rice’s status up in the air_ Kansas City traded up to get the Bills’ pick at No. 28 and take Worthy.  That move would come back to haunt the Bills in January_ when he caught a second-quarter touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes en route to a 32-29 win over Buffalo.   Worthy is now entering the second season of his four-year_ $13 million rookie contract.
298220742,BOSTON -- The Los Angeles Lakers' eight-game win streak came to an end Saturday against the Boston Celtics_ 111-101. But they might have lost more than just the game.  Lakers star LeBron James exited with 6:44 remaining in the fourth quarter with what the team is calling a left groin strain and did not return.  "It was the last play. The last score I had_ spun on Jaylen Brown_ it made me extended a little bit too much_" James said in describing the injury. "It took a bit_ but ... you know_ a couple pivots and then when I landed_ I felt it. So_ that was the last score."  It is too early to project an accurate timetable for how long James could be out_ sources told ESPN. However one source said the initial thought is that the injury will sideline James for a matter of weeks_ not a matter of days. After the loss_ though_ James sounded hopeful.  "Not much concern_ obviously we go day to day_ look at it each day_ see if it gets better_ and take the proper measurement machine_" James said. "See what we need to do going forward."  James had just scored with 7:05 remaining to pull the Lakers within seven points_ down 92-85_ after they trailed by as many as 22 points.  He finished with 22 points on 11-for-23 shooting (0-for-6 from 3) with 14 rebounds and 9 assists.  Los Angeles is entering a treacherous stretch of its schedule_ playing six games in the next eight days -- including two games apiece against the Denver Nuggets and Milwaukee Bucks.  "I think we just have to continue to play hard and play defense_" Lakers coach JJ Redick said.

Today's Connections answers So_ what are today's Connections answers for game #637? Drumroll_ please...  🟨 Computer input devices: Microphone_ Mouse_ Scanner_ Tablet 🟩 Building materials: Brick_ Concrete_ Metal_ Stone 🟦 Helpful deed: Favor_ Kindness_ Service_ Solid 🟪 #1 songs from 1982: Abracadabra_ Centerfold_ Mickey_ Physical All the building material words had me side-eyeing Solid trying to figure out an alternate meeting. I must have had charity on my mind today because I kicked things off with the blue category: Favor_ Kindness_ Service_ and Solid. After that came the yellow category with Microphone_ Mouse_ Scanner_ and Tablet_ which was simple enough being all parts of a computer. With eight clues left_ I started second-guessing my skepticism about the building material words. Surely it couldn't be that straightforward_ right? Well_ it was_ and Brick_ Concrete_ Metal_ and Stone rounded out the green category. All that left was purple_ which genuinely stumped me today. Likely because_ back in the year 1982_ I wasn't even a twinkle in my daddy's eye_ as they say. I was familiar with Mickey_ Physical_ and Centerfold (though I had to look it up before I realized what song it was). But Abracadabra_ I'm sorry to say_ I've never heard in my life. Yesterday's Connections answers  🟨 Faux: Artificial_ fake_ imitation_ mock 🟩 Washing machine cycles/settings: Bulky_ cotton_ delicate_ spin 🟦 Words said frequently in the "Bill and Ted" movies: Bogus_ dude_ excellent_ totally 🟪 ____ Box: Chatter_ juke_ shadow_ soap Reading this in a later time zone? Here are the Connections answers for game #636_ which had a difficulty rating of 2.8 out of 5_ according to the Connections Companion.  Bogus and dude to start today and was thinking of skaters_ mostly because I am excited for the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4 remake (mostly 3 as that was my entry). Excellent and totally were easy find from that point. I spotted the green bulky_ spin and delicate next before seeing cotton but left it alone thinking it wouldn't be purple. With the remaining 8_ fake_ imitation and artificial made me think of imitation crab (ugh) and got me to snag mock. Which I saved again. This left chatter_ juke_ shadow and soap that I put in to get the purple. To be honest_ I didn't see the box connection until I put it in_ but it makes sense. Better than yesterday's rotten fruit group. I wrapped it up with green then yellow to close out the puzzle.

298212348,Dear Abby: We lost our 16-year-old daughter two years ago to leukemia. It’s been a difficult two years. I am writing to ask if there are rules of etiquette for visiting a loved one at the cemetery? We go regularly. I decorate the area in front of her stone with holiday or seasonally appropriate decorations. Other family members and friends visit as well_ and most leave little trinkets or fresh flowers that I pick up and throw away when they wither_ or bring home and put in our daughter’s room.  My problem is_ one family member opens cards that have been left there for my daughter_ and puts all sorts of cheap decorations around her grave. Recently_ they put decorations directly on her gravestone which left large stains. We are now left searching for a professional to remove them_ or her stone will need to be replaced.  I’m beside myself. This is where I go to talk to my daughter to feel closer to her. It took a year for her stone to be set. I took my time choosing just the right etchings and picture_ and it’s a stone befitting our beautiful angel. Would it be wrong to set rules as to what people can and can’t leave when visiting my daughter’s final resting place? Can I tell someone they are no longer welcome to visit? — Protective in Pennsylvania  Dear Protective: Please accept my deepest sympathy for the loss of your daughter. I hope the relative who damaged her headstone apologized for it and volunteered to pay for the services of the professional cleaner. If not_ you should suggest it. And while you are at it_ you can also explain what kind of mementos you feel are appropriate at the gravesite.  Understand_ however_ that while you have the right to state your preferences_ unless there’s a guard watching your daughter’s final resting place_ there’s no guarantee they will be respected.  Dear Abby: We all meet acquaintances and say_ “Let’s grab dinner.” We intend to follow through but forget. A while back_ my wife and I made a list of 10 other couples we would like to get to know better and organized a group dinner. On the third Saturday of each month_ a couple hosts the group at a restaurant.  We don’t meet in homes or in December_ and_ yes_ sometimes only six couples attend_ but it’s often all of us. This is our 25th year_ and we have not missed a month. During COVID we gathered by Zoom. It’s not about the food — it’s about a caring group of friends sharing with each other. Abby_ I thought you might want to print this to inspire others. — One Host in Indiana  Dear Host: I think the lesson here is that someone has to be proactive and actually make plans rather than settle for good intentions. You did everyone_ including yourself_ a tremendous favor. Loneliness and isolation are serious problems for many.  Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren_ also known as Jeanne Phillips_ and was founded by her mother_ Pauline Phillips. Contact Dear Abby at www.DearAbby.com or P.O.

298248450,LAS VEGAS (AP) — Magomed Ankalaev’s plan coming into Saturday’s light heavyweight bout at UFC 313 was to pressure Alex Pereira.  And then add more pressure. And more.  The strategy worked_ as Ankalaev scored a stunning upset with a unanimous decision to take Pereira’s undisputed light heavyweight belt.  “I can’t even put it into words_” Ankalaev said in the ring during the post-fight interview through a translator. “It’s been such a long way_ and it’s my dream. It’s on my waist.”  All three judges scored in favor of Ankalaev (21-1-1)_ with scores of 49-46 and two at 48-47.  Ankalaev was never intimidated by his well-decorated opponent_ even after enduring a barrage of leg kicks in the first round.  Rather than play things cautiously_ Ankalaev went on the offensive and stayed aggressive in backing down Pereira while using an overpowering left hand that continued to stagger UFC’s top active star.  Bruce Buffer’s announcement with the result propelled a chorus of boos from the pro-Pereira crowd.  “I knew it would be a war_” said Pereira (12-3-0)_ who was putting his belt on the line for the fourth time. “Every fight of mine is a war.”  Pereira (12-2)_ who turns 38 on July 7_ closed -120 at BetMGM Sportsbook.  As close as the fight was_ UFC President and CEO Dana White had one word when asked about a potential rematch: “Probably.”  In the co-main event_ the No. 3-ranked lightweight and fan favorite Justin Gaethje (27-5-0) earned a unanimous decision over No. 11 Rafael Fiziev (12-4-0) in what was tabbed “ Fight of the Night.” Gaethje was scheduled to fight Dan Hooker_ who pulled out because of a hand injury. Gatheje dropped Fiziev with a stiff right uppercut in the second round.  Lightweight Ignacio Bahamondes (17-5-0) earned a first-round win when he made Jalin Turner (14-9-0) tap after administering a triangle choke at the 2:29 mark. Turner left the cage and waited in front of press row for Bahamondes to finish his interview_ intending to return to the cage to leave his gloves and signify his retirement. Security would not let him return_ however.  No. 5 strawweight contender Amanda Lemos improved to 15-4-1 with a unanimous decision over seventh-ranked Iasmin Lucindo (17-6-0).  Mauricio Ruffy (12-1-0) delivered a spinning heel kick with his right foot to the temple of King Green (32-17-1) to score a vicious knockout just 2:07 into the first round of their lightweight bout.  Just after Ruffy’s knockout kick and before the women’s bout_ a tribute video for Robbie Lawler played in honor of the former welterweight champion. Watching cageside_ an emotional Lawler received a standing ovation as it was announced he would be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame’s Modern Wing as a member of the Class of 2025. The ceremony will take place as part of the 13th Annual UFC International Fight Week on June 26.  “Robbie was an absolute killer_ and I have a ton of respect for his toughness and his fighting style_ which helped grow the sport of MMA and UFC by attracting a lot of new fans_” UFC president and CEO Dana White said in a statement.  This story has been changed to correct the scores in the 2nd graf.  AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports

298440650,Federal immigration authorities on Saturday detained a well-known activist who played a major role in Columbia University’s pro-Palestinian student movement last year_ his lawyer said on Sunday.  The arrest of the activist_ a legal permanent resident of the United States_ was a significant escalation of President Trump’s crackdown on what he has called antisemitic campus activity.  The activist_ Mahmoud Khalil_ is of Palestinian heritage and graduated in December with a master’s degree from the university’s school of international affairs_ according to his LinkedIn. His lawyer_ Amy Greer_ confirmed that he was a green card holder and said the arrest would face a vigorous legal challenge.  “We will vigorously be pursuing Mahmoud’s rights in court_ and will continue our efforts to right this terrible and inexcusable — and calculated — wrong committed against him_” Ms. Greer said in a statement. The arrest_ she said_ “follows the U.S. government’s open repression of student activism and political speech.”
298645438,A U.S.-flagged oil tanker has collided with a Portuguese container ship in the North Sea_ north of England_ with both ships catching on fire_ according to officials.  "HM Coastguard is currently co-ordinating the emergency response to reports of a collision between a tanker and cargo vessel off the coast of East Yorkshire resulting in fires aboard both vessels_" the U.K. coast guard said in a statement.  The U.S. ship was identified as the Stena Immaculate_ while the Portuguese-flagged container ship was identified as the Solong.  A coast guard helicopter has been sent_ as well as a fixed-wing aircraft_ several lifeboats and vessels with firefighting capabilities_ the coast guard said.  "The incident remains ongoing and an assessment of the likely counter pollution response required is being enacted_" the coast guard said in a statement.  This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.
298626320,By ELLEN KNICKMEYER_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development_ and said he would move the 18% of aid and development programs that survived under the State Department.  Rubio made the announcement in a post on X. It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development_ executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency teams.  Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and “our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform” in foreign aid.  President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.  Rubio’s social media post Monday said that review was now “officially ending_” with some 5_200 of USAID’s 6_200 programs eliminated.  Those programs “spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve_ (and in some cases even harmed)_ the core national interests of the United States_” Rubio wrote.  “In consultation with Congress_ we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping … to be administered more effectively under the State Department_” he said. Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally-funded programs illegal_ saying such a move requires Congress’ approval.  The State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower_ and no details of what programs were spared or how the State Department would run them.  The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump’s order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies_ strengthening alliances and building goodwill.  In the weeks after Trump’s order_ one of his appointees and transition team members_ Pete Marocco_ and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings_ shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands.  Contractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad.  Lawsuits brought by some of the nonprofit groups and businesses that had partnered with USAID say the form-letter contract terminations purge eliminated even programs that Rubio had said he wanted to save_ violated the contract terms and stiffed aid groups and businesses of billions of dollars.  The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas_ many of them awaiting U.S.-paid back payments and travel expenses back home.
298687460,Jack Teixeira_ a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard_ admitted leaking classified military information about the Ukraine war online. He is now set to face additional charges in his court-martial scheduled for Monday.  Last year_ Teixeira pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act by retaining and sharing national defense materials. This led to a 15-year prison sentence and was described by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland as a serious consequence for compromising national security.  Teixeira’s upcoming court-martial involves new charges of defying orders and interfering with justice. Military prosecutors argue that obeying orders is fundamental in the armed forces. Teixeira’s defense contends that prosecuting him again for the same offense is unjust.  Afterward_ Teixeira hugged one of his attorneys_ looked toward his family and smiled before being led from court. His family left without commenting to reporters_ but his mother and others submitted letters to the court seeking leniency.  "I know Jack deeply regrets his actions and is ready to accept his punishment for his part in this situation_” his mother_ Dawn Dufault_ wrote. “While I understand the severity of his charges and the importance of ensuring justice_ I implore you_ Your Honor_ to consider Jack’s true nature and his unique challenges_ as I have observed over the years.”  The security breach raised alarm over the country’s ability to protect its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to scramble to try to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks also embarrassed the Pentagon_ which tightened controls to safeguard classified information and disciplined members found to have intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira’s suspicious behavior.  Former FBI Director Chris Wray said in November that “Teixeira’s criminal conduct placed our nation_ our troops_ and our allies at great risk.”  “The FBI will continue to work diligently with our partners to protect classified information and ensure that those who turn their backs on their country face justice_” Wray said.   Teixeira_ of North Dighton_ Massachusetts_ was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts. He worked as a cyber transport systems specialist_ which is essentially an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks. He remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status_ an Air Force official told the Associated Press.   Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings.  Prosecutors also said Teixeira tried to cover his tracks before his April 2022 arrest. Authorities found a smashed tablet_ laptop and an Xbox gaming console in a dumpster at his house.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.
298660480,The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear a free-speech challenge to laws in Colorado_ California and 20 other states that forbid licensed counselors from seeking to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of minors. Beginning with California in 2012_ state lawmakers prohibited "conversion therapy" on the grounds it was ineffective and harmful. They said these treatments led to increased rates of depression_ anxiety and suicide. But the justices voted to hear a 1st Amendment claim from Kaley Chiles_ a licensed counselor from Colorado_ who contends the law violates her rights to the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion. She said her clients "seek Christian-based counseling to reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions_ change sexual behaviors_ or grow in the experience of harmony with their physical body.” She says she does not seek to "convert" or "cure" young clients_ but argues the state may not "censor" their conversations. The appeal was filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom_ a Christian legal group that has won Supreme Court rulings on behalf of a cake maker and a website designer who refused to work on weddings for same-sex couples. If the court strikes down the Colorado law_ the ruling would almost certainly strike down the similar laws in California and elsewhere. The new case tests whether "professional speech" may be subject to strict regulation by the state. Judges have upheld the California and Colorado laws against "conversion therapy" by ruling that states have broad power to regulate the practice of medicine and healthcare. This includes licensing and malpractice laws that can penalize doctors or other medical professionals for giving dangerous or highly inappropriate treatment recommendations. In defense of its law_ Colorado state attorneys said the Christian legal appeal argues "mental health professionals’ counseling of their patients is no different from a chat with one’s college roommate." Counselors who violate the law can be fined or lose their license. The state noted its law does not "apply to those providing services outside of the professional healthcare context_ like religious ministers or life coaches." Colorado's attorneys urged the court to affirm the view that "the 1st Amendment allows states to reasonably regulate professional conduct to protect patients from substandard treatment_ even when that regulation incidentally burdens speech." But conservatives_ led by Justice Clarence Thomas_ say the states are using these laws to enforce their own views. "There is a fierce public debate over how best to help minors with gender dysphoria_" Thomas said_ and the state has "silenced one side of this debate." He dissented two years ago along with Justices Samuel A. Alito and Brett M. Kavanaugh when the court turned down a similar free-speech challenge to a "conversion therapy" law from Washington state. "Licensed counselors can speak with minors about gender dysphoria_ but only if they convey the state-approved message of encouraging minors to explore their gender identities. Expressing any other message is forbidden — even if the counselor’s clients ask for help to accept their biological sex_" Thomas said. It takes at least four votes to hear an appeal_ which suggests one or more of the justices now agree with Thomas. The court will hear arguments in the case of Chiles vs. Salazar in the fall. Still pending before the court is a parallel dispute over state laws limiting the treatment of gender dysphoria. Tennessee and 23 Republican-led states recently adopted laws prohibiting doctors from prescribing puberty blockers or hormones for minors with gender dysphoria. The Biden administration sued_ contending the state was engaged in unconstitutional discrimination based on gender identity. However_ when the justices heard the case in December_ the court's conservatives said they were inclined to uphold Tennessee's law on the grounds the state has the authority to regulate the practice of medicine.
298683334,By ROB GILLIES  TORONTO (AP) — Ontario’s premier_ the leader of Canada’s most populous province_ announced that effective Monday his province is charging 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million Americans in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war.  Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota_ New York and Michigan.  “President Trump’s tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They’re making life more expensive for American families and businesses_” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a statement. “Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good_ Ontario won’t back down. We’ll stand strong_ use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.”  Ford has said Ontario’s tariff would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump_ noting a one month pause means nothing but more uncertainty.  Ford’s office said the new market rules require any generator selling electricity to the U.S. to add a 25% surcharge to the U.S. Ontario’s government expects it to generate revenue of $300_000 Canadian (US$208_000) to $400_000 Canadian (US$277_000) per day_ “which will be used to support Ontario workers_ families and businesses.”  The new surcharge is in addition to the federal government’s initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice_ peanut butter_ coffee_ appliances_ footwear_ cosmetics_ motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.  Trump launched a new trade war last week by imposing tariffs against Washington’s three biggest trading partners_ drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico_ Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin.  Trump later said he has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month_ amid widespread fears of a broader trade war.

298552388,ROME (AP) — Pope Francis is participating in the Vatican’s weeklong spiritual retreat from a Rome hospital as he continued his recovery on Monday from double pneumonia and looks ahead to the 12th anniversary of his election amid questions about what the future of his papacy might look like.  Francis followed the opening of the retreat by videoconference on Sunday: He could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini_ preacher of the papal household_ but the priests_ bishops and cardinals in the Vatican auditorium couldn’t see or hear him.   Pasolini delivered a meditation on “The hope of eternal life_” a theme that was chosen well before Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection.  The retreat_ which is an annual gathering that kicks off the Catholic Church’s solemn Lenten season leading to Easter_ continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate “in spiritual communion” with the rest of the hierarchy_ from afar.  In its early update Monday_ the Vatican said Francis was resting after a quiet night.  At the time of his hospitalization last month_ the 88-year-old pope_ who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man_ had what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.  He has now remained in stable condition for over a week_ with no fever_ respiratory crises and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days_ doctors reported.  The doctors said that such stability was in itself a positive thing and showed he was responding well to therapy. But they kept his prognosis as “guarded_” meaning that he’s not out of danger. Doctors were expected to provide a medical update later Monday.  On Thursday_ the Vatican will mark the 12th anniversary of Francis’ election_ the first with the pope out of sight but still very much in charge. Francis was elected the 266th pope_ the first Jesuit pope and first from Latin America_ on March 13_ 2013 following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI.  On Sunday_ Francis met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and the chief of staff_ Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra_ for the third time at the hospital. Such meetings are the routine way the pope governs_ and shows Francis is still keeping up with essential business.  While Francis has previously praised Benedict for his courage and humility in resigning_ he has indicated more recently that he believes the job of pope is for life and said as recently as last year that he had no plans of stepping down.  Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.

298840268,Rodrigo Duterte_ the former president of the Philippines_ was arrested Tuesday in Manila_ after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity in his war on drugs in which_ human rights groups say_ tens of thousands of Filipinos were summarily executed.  He was taken into custody at the airport in Manila after returning from a trip to Hong Kong_ according to the Philippine government.  Duterte_ 79_ who left office in 2022_ is a populist firebrand who remains one of the Philippines' most influential politicians_ and he has enjoyed relative immunity despite several accusations against him. Only a handful of people have been convicted in connection with the killings.  This article originally appeared in The New York Times.
299050558,President Donald Trump retaliated against Canada over its tariff on American electricity imports and said he would put an additional 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum_ taking it up to 50 percent_ as a result.In a post on his Truth Social platform_ Trump said he had instructed his Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to implement the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada effective March 12.Why it MattersThe tariffs are part of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and Canada.The president started the latest conflict over what his administration perceives as a lack of sufficient action to stop the flow of illicit drugs such as fentanyl across America's borders_ fueling an opioid epidemic that has cost thousands of lives through overdoses.Trump has also put new tariffs on Mexico and China for the same reason_ and his administration says it will introduce reciprocal tariffs—these aimed at creating what it sees as fairness in all its trading relationships—across the world on April 2.This burgeoning trade war is unsettling markets_ which fear that a North American recession is looming as a result.But Trump sees tariffs as a powerful tool to either protect the domestic economy from unfair global competition_ or to force much better trading terms for the U.S. from those who_ in his view_ are taking advantage at the expense of American firms and consumers.What to KnowOn Monday_ Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the 25 percent surcharge on electricity sales to Michigan_ Minnesota_ and New York in response to Trump's new tariffs on Canadian goods.Ford estimated that his new surcharge would cost "families and businesses in these states up to $400_000 each and every single day."According to the Narwhal_ a nonprofit Canadian media outlet_ Ontario sells about $700 million in electricity to the United States each year_ which provides power for 1.5 million homes.In his Truth Social post_ Trump also told Canada to "immediately drop their Anti-American Farmer Tariff of 250% to 390% on various U.S. dairy products_ which has long been considered outrageous."The president said he would declare a national emergency on electricity in the area affected by Canada's tariff_ describing it as an "abusive threat".He said more tariffs would come for Canada unless they dropped their own against America."If other egregious_ long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada_ I will substantially increase_ on April 2nd_ the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will_ essentially_ permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada_" Trump wrote. "Those cars can easily be made in the USA!"Trump Repeats 51st State LineTrump said the U.S. was "subsidizing" Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year and said the only thing that made sense was for it to become America's "cherished" fifty-first state.It's a suggestion he has made several times in recent months to both the amusement and frustration of Canadians."The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear_ and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant anthem_ 'O Canada_' will continue to play_ but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.What People Are SayingOntario Premier Doug Ford told reporters on Monday: "We will apply maximum pressure to maximize our leverage ... Let me be clear: I will not hesitate to increase this charge if necessary. If the United States escalates_ I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely. Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people who started this trade war. It's one person who is responsible_ that's President Trump."Gerard Lyons_ chief economic strategist at Netwealth_ said of the recent market turmoil: "When Trump was elected it was clear that his economic policies contained the good_ the bad and the uncertain. The markets initially focused on the good—in terms of his tax and regulatory changes for the US economy. Now the focus is on the bad—namely tariffs. The uncertainty around the execution of these adds to the uncertainty. Tariffs can have a triple whammy_ adding to worries about inflation_ growth and denting confidence."What Happens NextThe latest tariffs hike on Canadian steel and aluminum starts March 12. Canada's Ford has said he would respond again to any escalation_ so watch this space. Then_ coming April 2_ we have the big one—America's reciprocal tariffs all around the world.
298994094,Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' "bags fly free" — but not for long. Starting May 28 — just in time for the busy summer travel season — only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members_ Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28_ the carrier says. "Just another airline"?It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history — one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier_ according to experts."This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this_ I think_ is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin_" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt_ of Atmosphere Research Group_ told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. "Southwest_ with these changes_ becomes just another airline."Just last September_ Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge."Bags will still fly free_" Jordan said. "It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free_ on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free."But when pressed if they'd always fly free_ he acknowledged_ "Well_ never say never. … It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change_ but from everything that we see_ there's no reason to reconsider this at all_ especially right now.""When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it_ you are telling almost all of your customers_ 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore_'" Harteveldt said. "We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg."The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.Mounting financial pressureThe move comes as Southwest_ the nation's fourth-largest airline_ has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic. Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs_ launched its first redeye flights_ and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead_ the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program — increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive "Wanna Get Away" and "Wanna Get Away Plus" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher- and lower demand flights.What's more_ starting May 28_ Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.In a video statement Tuesday morning_ Jordan said the changes "will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect_ and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want."Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand_ a rise in premium demand_ and a change in customer preferences."Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future."We are more than the logo on our planes_" he said. "Our DNA isn't open seating_ or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service."Harteveldt says_ "More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way_ and I believe they will_ they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing."Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product_ which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit. While the offerings vary by airline_ basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment_ tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year. "Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets — amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers_ a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S._ and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members_" the carrier said in a statement.But is the Southwest that people know?"Yes_" Harteveldt said. "This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful."
298893548,Ukraine targeted Moscow in a "massive" overnight drone attack_ authorities said Tuesday_ with Russia's defense ministry claiming it shot down 337 UAVs across the country."The Defense Ministry's air defense continues to repel a massive attack by enemy drones on Moscow_" mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram early Tuesday.Russia's military shot down 91 drones around the capital_ the defense ministry said in a statement_ adding it downed another 126 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine.At least one person was killed and three more wounded in the southern suburbs of Moscow_ according to the region's governor_ Andrei Vorobyov.He added that drone debris damaged at least seven units in a residential building in another suburb in the southeast.The attack on the Russian capital_ hundreds of kilometres from the Ukraine border_ comes ahead of an expected meeting Tuesday between top US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.Ukraine is set to present the United States with a plan for a partial ceasefire with Russia_ hoping to restore support from its key benefactor_ which under President Donald Trump has demanded concessions to end the three-year war.The talks in Saudi Arabia will be the most senior since a disastrous White House meeting last month_ when Trump berated Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky for purported ingratitude.Since Trump's dressing down of Zelensky_ Washington has suspended military aid to Ukraine as well as intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery in a bid to force it to the negotiating table.
298892440,President Trump said he will buy a Tesla to support DOGE head Elon Musk’s “baby” after the electric car manufacturer has faced plummeting stock and boycotts over its billionaire CEO’s work with the White House.  Trump rushed to Musk’s defense against the so-called “Radical Left Lunatics” who have staged protests against Tesla across the US as the company’s chief has been hacking away at federal government spending and jobs in his new gig leading the Department of Government Efficiency.   “To Republicans_ Conservatives_ and all great Americans_ Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation_ and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after midnight Tuesday.  “But the Radical Left Lunatics_ as they often do_ are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla_ one of the World’s great automakers_ and Elon’s ‘baby_’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon_ and everything he stands for.”  The president said he’d purchase a Tesla in the morning “as a show of confidence” in Musk_ who is also the CEO of SpaceX and the social media platform X.  “In any event_ I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk_ a truly great American_” he wrote. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”  It’s unclear what model Tesla Trump plans to buy.   The electric automotive maker’s share price has nose-dived by nearly a third since Trump became president after an initial boost. Tesla’s stock has dropped by more than 28% in the last month and nearly 32% since Jan. 1.  Protests against Musk and his government cuts have popped up at numerous Tesla dealerships across the country — including a Manhattan showroom_ where six protesters were arrested on Saturday.   A Tesla dealership in Colorado was vandalized last month when a 40-year-old woman allegedly spray-painted “Nazi cars” on the building and hurled Molotov cocktails at vehicles on the property.  Tesla owners have also reported that their cars have become a target for anti-Musk vandalism. Some owners have replaced Tesla logos on their rides with badges of other auto manufacturers in an attempt to thwart potential vandals — and/or distance themselves from the DOGE head and his political beliefs.
