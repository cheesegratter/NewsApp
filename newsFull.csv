225109966,Scottie Scheffler is a free man. Early on Friday_ May 17_ the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) placed Scheffler under arrest and charged him with four crimes_ which included assaulting a police officer to the second degree�a felony. However_ a report from Terry Meiners_ a radio personality from Louisville_ Kentucky_ indicates that police will drop these charges. This announcement comes six days after Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel addressed the media and released two videos that detailed the incident. Another press conference featuring Jefferson County Attorney Mike O�Connell and Scheffler�s defense attorney_ Steve Romines_ is set for Wednesday. Since this session with media is scheduled five days before Scheffler�s arraignment_ early indications pointed to prosecutors dropping this case altogether. It makes sense for them to do so_ considering the videos released made things look as if Scheffler did nothing wrong. Scheffler tried maneuvering around traffic and entering Valhalla�s front gates before his second-round tee time that morning. A tragic fatal accident had occurred earlier_ thus leading to the logjam and an increased police presence. But the two-time Masters champion did not realize that someone had lost their life. He only wanted to get to the course to warm up. Other PGA Tour players admitted to doing the same thing_ but Scheffler had a �big miscommunication� with the police. Given the time of day and the rainy conditions_ eyewitnesses on the scene_ namely ESPN�s Jeff Darlington_ who broke the story_ also reported how difficult it was to see. Another video released early Wednesday also included Scheffler�s perspective. Within that_ Scheffler initially did not realize that the officer directing traffic was a police officer. Nevertheless_ it looks as if everyone involved in this case can move on from the matter. Jack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation�s Playing Through.

225012756,Giant pandas are set to return to the National Zoo in Washington_ D.C._ by the end of the year_ officials announced Wednesday. China will send a new pair of giant pandas_ male Bao Li and female Qing Bao_ under a 10-year breeding and research agreement_ the zoo said in a press release. Both bears are 2 years old. �We�re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears_ including a descendent of our beloved panda family_ to Washington_ D.C._� the zoo�s director_ Brandie Smith_ said in a release. �This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact. Through this partnership_ we have grown the panda population_ advanced our shared understanding of how to care for this beloved bear and learned what�s needed to protect wild pandas and preserve native habitat.� Chinese ambassador Xie Feng is scheduled to make brief remarks on Wednesday morning. Smith and other zoo officials are set to address the media_ as well_ the zoo said in a press release. The announcement comes six months after the National Zoo�s three iconic pandas returned to China as a conservation agreement expired_ leaving just a few pandas in United States zoos. In February_ China announced plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. One of the bears headed to D.C. has family ties to the National Zoo�s panda family. Bao Li is the offspring of Bao Bao_ who was born at the National Zoo in 2013. That makes Bao Li the grandchild of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian_ the zoo said. The name means "treasure" and "energetic" in Mandarin Chinese. The female bear_ Qing Bao_ was born in China on Sept. 12_ 2021_ the zoo said. Her name means "green" and "treasure_" the zoo said. Giant pandas were a staple at D.C.�s National Zoo for over 50 years The National Zoo�s longstanding resident pandas_ Tian Tian and Mei Xiang_ departed D.C. last fall_ along with their youngest offspring_ Xiao Qi Ji_ who was born at the zoo in 2020. After an emotional goodbye_ the three went to new homes in the China Wildlife Conservation Association_ leaving the National Zoo's giant panda habitat vacant for the first time in decades. Pandas first arrived at the National Zoo in the 1970s and evolved into D.C.'s unofficial mascots. The black-and-white bears appeared on Metro cards_ street signs and statues around the District. The panda conservation program flourished after Tian Tian and Mei Xiang arrived 20 years ago. Mei Xiang gave birth to four surviving cubs_ Tai Shan_ Bao Bao_ Bei Bei and Xiao Ji Qi � the first panda in the U.S. born after his mother was artificially inseminated with frozen_ instead of fresh_ semen. The agreement keeping Tian Tian and Mei Xiang was extended several times. The panda program has always served as a gesture of friendship and a sort of soft diplomacy between China and the United States_ so the pullback of pandas at the National Zoo and other zoos in the United States caused some concern. Currently_ there are only four pandas in the country � all at Atlanta�s zoo. But in February_ news that China plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo signaled the return of panda diplomacy. Despite the links to U.S.-China diplomacy_ the negotiations are researcher-to-researcher and not based in politics_ Smith_ the National Zoo's director_ told News4 last summer. "We're a bunch of scientists; we're a bunch of animal people_" Smith said. "This is not a political conversation. This is absolutely a conversation between colleagues talking about_ what's best for the overall program_ and also_ what can be best for individual animals?" Want to know what's up for your weekend?

Neither incident merits his recusal_ he wrote. �I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request_� he wrote.

225031922,DETROIT (AP) � Nissan is urging the owners of about 84_000 older vehicles to stop driving them because their Takata air bag inflators have an increased risk of exploding in a crash and hurling dangerous metal fragments. Wednesday�s urgent request comes after one person in a Nissan was killed by an exploding front-passenger inflator_ and as many as 58 people were injured since 2015. �Due to the age of the vehicles equipped with defective Takata air bag inflators_ there is an increased risk the inflator could explode during an air bag deployment_ propelling sharp metal fragments which can cause serious injury or death_� Nissan said in a statement. Nissan said the �do not drive� warning covers certain 2002 through 2006 Sentra small cars_ as well as some 2002 through 2004 Pathfinder SUVs_ and 2002 and 2003 Infiniti QX4 SUVs. Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall or infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers_ and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available. �Even minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering_ gruesome injuries_� the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. �Older model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk_ as the age of the air bag is one of the contributing factors.� Nissan originally recalled 736_422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84_000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators. The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018_ the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra_ according to Nissan. The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators_ which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force_ blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia_ Australia and the U.S. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history_ with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata into bankruptcy. Honda_ Ford_ BMW_ Toyota and Stellantis and Mazda have issued similar �do not drive� warnings for some of their vehicles equipped with Takata inflators.
224779450,NEW YORK � Josh Gibson became Major League Baseball�s career leader with a .372 batting average_ surpassing Ty Cobb�s .367_ when Negro Leagues records for more than 2_300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project. Gibson�s .466 average for the 1943 Homestead Grays became the season standard_ followed by Charlie �Chino� Smith�s .451 for the 1929 New York Lincoln Giants. They overtook the .440 by Hugh Duffy for the National League�s Boston team in 1894. Gibson also became the career leader in slugging percentage (.718) and OPS (1.177)_ moving ahead of Babe Ruth (.690 and 1.164). �This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible_� baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. �Their accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson�s 1947 Dodger debut.� A special committee on baseball records decided in 1969 to recognize six major leagues dating to 1876: the National (which launched in 1876)_ the American (1901)_ the American Association (1882-1891)_ Union Association (1884)_ Players� League (1890)_ and Federal League (1914-1915). It excluded the National Association (1871-75)_ citing an �erratic schedule and procedures.� MLB announced in December 2020 that it would be �correcting a longtime oversight� and would add the Negro Leagues. John Thorn_ MLB�s official historian_ chaired a 17-person committee that included Negro Leagues experts and statisticians. �The condensed 60-game season for the 2020 calendar year for the National League and American League prompted us to think that maybe the shortened Negro League seasons could come under the MLB umbrella_ after all_� Thorn said. An updated version of MLB�s database will become public before the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants play a tribute game to the Negro Leagues on June 20 at Rickwood Field in Birmingham_ Alabama. Baseball Hall of Fame President Josh Rawitch said statistics on Cooperstown plaques would remain the same because they reflect the information available at the time of a player�s induction. Standards for season leaders is the same for Negro Leagues as the other leagues: 3.1 plate appearances or one inning for each game played by a player�s team. Gibson�s .974 slugging percentage in 1937 becomes the season record_ and Barry Bonds� .863 in 2001 dropped to fifth_ also trailing Mules Suttles .877 in 1926_ Gibson�s .871 in 1943 and Smith�s .870 in 1929. Bond�s prior OPS record of 1.421 in 2004 dropped to third behind Gibson�s 1.474 in 1937 and 1.435 in 1943. Willie Mays gained 10 hits from the 1948 Birmingham Black Barons_ increasing his total to 3_293. Minnie Minoso surpassed 2_000 hits_ credited with 150 for the New York Cubans from 1946-1948 that boosted his total to 2_113. Robinson_ who broke MLB�s color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers_ was credited with 49 hits with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs that increased his total to 1_567. Among pitchers_ Satchel Paige gained 28 wins that raised his total to 125. The committee met six times and dealt with issues such as when compiled league statistics didn�t make sense_ such as a league having more wins than losses and walks that were missing. Researchers had to identify whether players with the same name were one person or separate_ tracking dates of birth_ and identify people listed by nicknames. Documenting transactions and identifying ballparks in a time when neutral sites often were used is ongoing_ along with uncovering statistics for independent teams. Kevin Johnson and Gary Ashwill_ researchers who had spent nearly two decades helping assemble the Seamheads Negro Leagues Database_ were included in the project. Thorn estimated 72% of Negro Leagues records from 1920-1948 are included and additional research might lead to future modifications. Thorn said a four-homer game by Gibson in 1938 and a home run by Mays in August 1948 could not be included because complete game accounts have not been found. �Without a box score_ we can�t really balance the statistics_� Johnson said. �Those games are kind of in limbo at the moment.� Records include the first Negro National League (1920-31)_ Eastern Colored League (1923-28)_ American Negro League (1929)_ East-West League (1932)_ Negro Southern League (1932)_ second Negro National League (1933-48) and Negro American League (1937-48). Some game details were obtained from newspapers that covered the Black communities. Johnson said while complete accounts were found for about 95% of games in the 1920s_ coverage dropped off during the Great Depression in the 1930s and never fully recovered.

Here’s how it works.  Elden Ring Nightreign review  Nightreign isn't the Elden Ring co-op experience you'd expect_ but it's kind of brilliant anyway.  Tyler Colp   28 May 2025  (Image: © Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Our Verdict  Elden Ring Nightreign is just as confusing and abrasive as FromSoftware's other games_ but there's really nothing else like it.  PC Gamer's got your back  Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review_ to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.  Need to Know  What is it? A co-op action RPG battle royale hybrid set in the Elden Ring universe Release date May 30_ 2025 Expect to pay $40/£35 Developer FromSoftware Publisher Bandai Namco Reviewed on RTX 5090_ Intel Core i9 12900K_ 16GB RAM Multiplayer Yes Steam Deck Untested Link Official site In the fight against Elden Ring Nightreign's riff on Mothra_ I never expected it would eventually touch down and mount the head of its partner_ a giant stick bug with claws_ like a mech. For the rest of the fight they were operating in unison_ a kaiju cowboy with orbital lasers piercing the sky. That's a problem pesticide can't solve_ but_ as it turns out_ three guys with bows absolutely can.  There's nothing like fighting a boss in a FromSoftware game that is designed to be a joke with you as the punchline—and defying fate with your own ridiculous strategy. Elden Ring Nightreign is a game about losing a fistfight over and over until you luck or strategize your way into an opportunity to bring three guns. The harder you've been hit the more glorious the payback_ and Nightreign is a merciless bully. Even if you've played Elden Ring_ Nightreign will surprise you. Imagine the Lands Between as a stadium filled with familiar monsters and a team of three players as its contestants. It's an action RPG as a sport_ cranked up to two times speed_ and designed to be replayed every 30 minutes. Randomized loot and an ever-tightening battle royale-style circle apply constant pressure that you're only released from at the end of the match_ whether you survive or not.  You may like  Elden Ring Nightreign's story is told in part through playable memories_ so FromSoftware really is delivering lore through whacking things  The First Berserker: Khazan review – Smart soulslike combat and boss design despite somewhat samey missions  Elden Ring Nightreign PC performance analysis: A bare-bones console port with glitches a-plenty  Nightreign is the most peculiar game FromSoft has made since the '90s. It's also its most abrasive.  Even now after putting well over 30 hours into it_ I believe Nightreign is both a trend-defying remix of Elden Ring and also a pile of complete bullshit that I shouldn't have to deal with in the year 2025.  (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods I can't help but respect the fact that it works_ however. Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods_ and yet that is exactly what I've been doing in Nightreign. We've been "looting churches_" "clearing camps_" and "popping crab" for the past week. Some of my most heated_ frustrating moments—like when a boss "invaded" my run to steal entire levels from me before peacing out—were cooled by the fact that I was palling around Elden Ring like it was Fortnite. There were also plenty of times I was convinced that maybe Nightreign is actually a terrible idea. Elden Ring didn't need a time limit_ nor did it need a randomized loot system. The randomization often feels designed—or under-designed—just to screw you over. There's a difference between mistiming a dodge on a fatal attack and spending 10 minutes on a grueling boss fight because the map refused to cough up a holy weapon for a boss who is weak to holy. This game has optional events where you can spend half of a run fighting for a bonus reward that will be irrelevant to the final boss you've targeted for that session—or any boss for that matter. And the ability to meaningfully buildcraft is in constant tension with Nightreign's pace and its UI_ which obfuscates key information around damage scaling and weapon abilities. Do you know the difference between Dragon Communion Incantations and Dragon Cult Incantations? I don't either_ but you have five seconds to figure it out before the circle consumes you. Nightreign is kind of a mess. FromSoftware's inscrutable terminology and uneven balance makes the learning curve much steeper than it needs to be. Or maybe that's the beauty of it: A game not trying to entice you with daily login bonuses or battle passes_ but a language to learn over the course of hundreds of runs. In that way_ it emulates the joys of gaining acuity with any of the studio's other games. But that might also be why the structure of Nightreign falls apart for me. If you hated running back to a boss in Elden Ring_ try doing that with a whole-ass battle royale to survive on the way there. It's hard to enjoy the journey when the destination is the only thing you're meaningfully rewarded for. Each character in Nightreign can equip three Relics with passive benefits that range from unnoticeable (dexterity +2) to game-changing (item effects or healing flasks are shared with all players). Most of them are trash and will have little to no bearing on whether or not you can kill the final boss_ let alone reach them. But that's all that you get to take home after each run. Build-brained  Nightreign's major bosses tend to be extremely mobile_ so get ready to sprint a lot. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware) Nightreign wants you in it for the love of the game_ and while I can appreciate that in a sea of games that practically bribe you to keep playing_ it can also make the routine moments of a run kind of boring. Elden Ring has its punishing sections_ but there's always something else to do. In Nightreign_ you just fight bosses until you're strong enough to fight a different boss. When my team cut down the final one_ I couldn't think of many reasons compelling me to do it all over again. But later_ I watched a recording of the fight and saw that the final sliver of health on a boss we'd attempted at least six times was extinguished by the tiny magical daggers summoned by my sword's passive effect. And that's when the gears started turning. What if I found that weapon again and actually played the right character with the right items to emphasize that technique? What other effects have I ignored that could inspire entirely new strategies? I immediately wanted to go for another run as an experiment.  A rare_ precious item allowing you to revive once after death. Good luck getting one. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. Uh oh. It's possible Nightreign rules_ actually. The combinations of weapons and effects you can put together in a run frequently activate my "RPG build" neurons. Part of the reason we even made it to the point where the final boss was nine magic glintblades away from death is that I discovered the "successive attacks negate damage" passive effect. On most of Nightreign's eight playable characters it's hard to activate_ but it naturally synergizes with the dual-wielding knife specialist Duchess' playstyle. Though she's normally one of the squishiest nightfarers_ a flurry of stabs into a boss and I could tank an attack that would take my teammates out in one hit. Paired with a Relic that automatically activates her skill to repeat damage done to a boss after landing several hits in a row and I was playing an immortal god. The problem is you won't find those buffs every run—or on the right character. But when you do_ the thrill of having that kind of power in a FromSoft game is delicious_ especially when the difficulty is as brutal as Nightreign's. The RNG of it all and the number of bosses standing between you and the end demands a high level of execution and_ frankly_ luck. You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. In Fortnite_ the odds are stacked against you. One hundred players enter a match and only one comes out a winner. In Nightreign the odds are the same_ except most of the time the game wins. This feels backwards to how I've always approached FromSoft games_ but the elation of finally getting a win can be tantalizing. And that's all it takes to pull me back in. It doesn't matter whether it's a silly weapon I want to try again or a different character I want to learn_ like the witch who can yank magic out of enemies to buff her allies. Every time I get a taste of victory_ I forget the misery of spending 30 minutes to lose to a boss and hit the button to do it again anyway. Brutal but brilliant  Lucking into a great weapon drop can make all the struggle feel worth it. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played All of Nightreign's faults fade when the brutal difficulty and the randomized nature of it creates something beautiful_ like when you discover the skeletons summoned by the little necromancer girl can revive you when you're downed. Or when you're fighting a jellyfish god from another planet and your buddy in Skyrim armor screams as he rises into the sky on a giant rock_ saving you from a big attack. Or when you're low on healing flasks and praying for an easy boss and out from the dark portal steps a nightmare from an entirely different game_ one you thought you'd never have to face again. Sometimes Nightreign is so cruel all you can do is laugh as it shoves your nose in the dirt. But then it turns around and delivers catharsis. Everyone cheered in voice chat when Centipede Demon_ the boss nobody remembers from Dark Souls_ showed up to get obliterated by 14 years of action RPG combat advancement. When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played. I just wish it wasn't so hard to play—not because the bosses are tough_ but because of how indifferent it is to helping you experience everything that's so endearing about it. All the work is on you to find something that draws you back in_ to find a reason to try again. For me that's a new build or a new character to focus on with a game-changing Relic setup. For others it can be helping out a friend struggling with the brutal difficulty. And for something as experimental and as weird as Nightreign is_ that might be enough. Nightreign is light on story_ but it carries with it my favorite theme core to all of FromSoft's games: The irresistible nature to persevere against what feels like impossible odds. That I can spend three hours getting pummeled by a game as impenetrable as this and still feel the urge to give it another go has me annoyed that the same trick's working on me again. Nightreign may be kind of a mess_ but it's a mess made just for me.

325600490,Kyle Chrisley is happy his parents are coming home from prison.    On Tuesday_ May 27_ shortly after his younger sister Savannah Chrisley_ 27_ announced that dad Todd Chrisley and step-mom Julie Chrisley received a pardon from President Donald Trump_ the 33-year-old shared his reaction.    "I'm ecstatic_" Kyle told E! News. "Truly. I just found out a little bit ago and I still just can't believe it."   His biological mother is Todd’s ex-wife_ Teresa Terry.   "I know Savannah had been working at this for so long and she never gave up_" he continued. "So I'm just grateful to her and to President Trump for making this happen for my dad and Julie."   Todd_ 56_ and Julie_ 52_ were indicted in August 2019 and later sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison after being convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The couple had been appealing their case ever since.   Kyle_ who only appeared on the first season of Chrisley Knows Best as he became estranged from his father_ told E! News he is hopeful for the future.   "I know they can't wait to get home and just be with family_ and I'm going to remain hopeful that another reconciliation is possible_" Kyle told the outlet.   During a July 2024 episode of her Unlocked podcast_ Savannah explained why their father chose not to speak with Kyle.   “My dad has every reason not to speak to Kyle_” she said. “Just because it’s your child doesn’t mean that you have to accept abuse. It doesn't mean you have to accept manipulation and hate and all these things.”   After saying she and her father had the “strongest relationship_” she spoke out against her sibling.   “People will do anything for a little bit of fame or attention_” Savannah claimed_ saying Kyle provides statements about their father on social media and to the press. “What I don't process well is having Kyle play the victim to life circumstances he's created. What I don't do well with someone who has abused people his entire life now trying to play victim_ trying to get people to feel bad for him.”   She continued_ “Yes_ my father has not spoken to him and that is because now_ we are all at a place where we don't have to be abused any further. We are allowed to create boundaries for ourselves.”   On Tuesday_ Savannah said Trump called her personally to let her know he would be pardoning her parents.    Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Thank you Mr President for bringing my family back_" he wrote on his Instagram Story over a photo of Trump sitting in the Oval Office.

325813908,Hamas’s chief in Gaza_ Mohammed Sinwar_ has been killed_ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on May 28.  Speaking before the Knesset_ Israel’s Parliament_ Netanyahu said that the Jewish state has “eliminated Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif_ Yahya Sinwar_ and Mohammed Sinwar.”  Haniyeh was Hamas’s political leader when he was taken out by Israel in Tehran in July 2024. Deif was the head of Hamas’s military wing when he was killed by Israel in Gaza that same month. Yahya Sinwar_ who was the leader of Hamas_ was the mastermind behind Hamas’s Oct. 7_ 2023_ terrorist attack on Israel. He was killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza in October 2024. He was succeeded by his brother_ Mohammed.  Mohammed Sinwar_ 49_ was taken out by an Israeli strike in the Gaza city of Khan Younis_ where he once commanded the town’s brigade.  “In the last two days_ we’ve been executing a dramatic plan toward the complete defeat of Hamas_” Netanyahu said. “We’re taking control of their food distribution and money machine. This is what destroys their governing capabilities. That’s what we promised.”  Mohammed Sinwar’s history of terrorism includes being involved in the Hamas group that captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006_ who was held for five years before being released as part of an exchange that resulted in the release of more than 1_000 Palestinian terrorist prisoners. In the previous decade_ he spent nine months behind bars in Ramallah before escaping in 2000.

325587004,Elon Musk says he is "disappointed" by the price tag on the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House last week and heavily backed by President Trump_ the billionaire who recently stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE_ told "CBS Sunday Morning" in an exclusive broadcast interview."I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk said.Musk's comments appear to put him at odds with Mr. Trump_ who has championed the massive spending package. The legislation — which still needs to pass the Senate — would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts_ boost border security spending_ impose work requirements on Medicaid and roll back clean energy tax credits.The tax provisions of the package_ titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" after Mr. Trump's name for the bill_ would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034_ according to the Congressional Budget Office."I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_" Musk told CBS News_ "but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion."Musk was a near-constant presence in the early months of the Trump administration_ with his DOGE staffers sweeping through virtually every government agency to make widespread cuts — drawing concern from Democrats and even some Trump allies_ as well as numerous legal challenges. Musk_ who is also the CEO of Tesla_ SpaceX and the social media platform X_ has said he will dial back his involvement in government.See more of the interview with Elon Musk on "CBS Sunday Morning" on June 1.

325577048,It’s clear that Terry Bradshaw isn’t about to suggest Aaron Rodgers should wear the number 12 jersey for the Steelers. It’s even more obvious that Rodgers wouldn’t agree to it.  Bradshaw was blunt_ as he often is_ regarding the Steelers’ decision to wait indefinitely on Rodgers.  “That’s ridiculous_” Bradshaw remarked on 103.7 The Buzz in Little Rock_ Arkansas (as reported by CBSSports.com). “I find that notion laughable. What_ bring him in for just a single season? Are you serious? . . . . He should remain in California. Head out there_ munch on some tree bark_ and have conversations with the spirits.”  Bradshaw believes the Steelers should have given 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett more of a chance.  “I was a fan of Kenny Pickett_” Bradshaw mentioned. “I appreciated his play at Pitt. I know him and understand his character. When Pittsburgh got him_ here’s what they failed to do: They didn’t offer him protection…they didn’t provide a solid offensive line. They were focused on running the ball without a line capable of proper defense_ and they also lacked weapons. He virtually had no notable wide receivers.”  “And then they throw a kid in there for two years and you’ve got an offense that doesn’t fit and doesn’t work_ and they can’t run because their offensive line’s not even good enough for a run blocking team. And therefore they say Pickett was a failure. He wasn’t a failure_ the Steelers were a failure.”  The Steelers are willing to give Rodgers as much time as he wants because they believe_ with Rodgers at quarterback_ they won’t fail in 2025.   It all depends on what counts as success. Making the playoffs? Winning a playoff game? Getting to the conference championship?  Rodgers simply needs a season strong enough to cause his 2024 experience with the Jets to be viewed as an aberration. The Steelers and their fans could be aiming a lot higher than that.
325708928,May 28 (UPI) -- The Czech Republic accused China on Wednesday of being responsible for a "malicious cyber campaign" that targeted an unclassified network of the foreign ministry.  Little information about the cyberattack was made public_ the Czech government said it began in 2022_ affected an institution designated as Czech critical infrastructure and that it was perpetrated by well-known China-backed hackers APT31.  "The Government of the Czech Republic strongly condemns this malicious cyber campaign against its critical infrastructure_" the Czech foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.  "Such behavior undermines the credibility of the People's Republic of China and contradicts its public declarations."  APT31_ which stands for Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31_ is a collection of China state-sponsored intelligence officers_ contract hackers and support staff that conduct cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government.  Seven Chinese nationals were charged in the United States in late March for their involvement in APT31_ which federal prosecutors said has targeted U.S. and foreign critics of the Chinese government_ business_ and political officials over the last 14 years.  The Czech government said Wednesday it tied APT31 to the cyberattack through an "extensive investigation_" which "led to a high degree of certainty about the responsible actor."  "The Government of the Czech Republic has identified the People's Republic of China as being responsible_" it said.  NATO and the European Union -- both of which Czech is a member of -- were quick to condemn China following Prague's revelation.  "We stand in solidarity with the Czech Republic following the malicious cyber campaign against its Ministry of Foreign Affairs_" the security alliance said in a statement.  NATO did not blame China but acknowledged the Czechs' accusation of Beijing for the attack and said that it has observed "with increasing concern the growing pattern of malicious cyber activities stemming from the People's Republic of China."  Similarly_ the EU did not directly point the finger at China for the attack on the Czech Republic_ but said there have been cyberattacks linked to Beijing targeting EU and its member stats.  "In 2021_ we urged Chinese authorities to take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from their territories. Since then_ several Member States have attributed similar activities at their national level_" the EU's high representative_ Kaja Kallas_ said in a statement.  "We have repeatedly raised our concerns during bilateral engagements and we will continue to do so in the future."

325964330,While FromSoftware released a fairly impressive-looking launch trailer for Elden Ring Nightreign_ it has another that may resonate with fans on a deeper level. It showcases more gameplay with the Revenant_ the eighth and final Nightfarer to be revealed_ set to the tune of “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence. Yes_ seriously. Check it out below.  One of the Revenant’s abilities involves raising her downed allies_ which could very well be her Ultimate Art (and is the entire reason for the song).

325944054,Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday evening that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students_ including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields.”  He added that the State Department was revising visa criteria to “enhance scrutiny” of all future applications from China_ including Hong Kong.  The move is certain to send ripples of anxiety across university campuses in the United States and spur recriminations in China. China is the country of origin for the second-largest group of international students in the United States_ and many universities rely on Chinese and other international students paying full tuition for a substantial part of their annual revenue.  American universities have also benefited over many decades by drawing some of the most talented students from China and other countries. Chinese students and researchers are represented in large numbers in university science laboratories.
326084092,The dollar_ which has been under pressure since Mr. Trump started a trade war with U.S. trading partners_ rose on Wednesday. Oil prices_ which have dipped on fears that a slowdown in trade would hamper economic growth_ also jumped. The price of gold_ which has set a series of record highs as investors flocked to the traditional haven in times of turmoil_ slipped.  Investors sold U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 30-year Treasury note_ a focus for investors after Mr. Trump’s bill to cut taxes deepened worries about debt and deficits_ rose back above 5 percent. A significant reduction or cancellation of a chunk of U.S. tariffs “would be bad news for Treasuries since it would reduce a significant source of income and widen the budget deficit over the coming decade_” analysts at Panmure Liberum wrote in a note.  They added that the court ruling suggests that in the long run_ “extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely to happen going forward_ which reduces uncertainty somewhat.” But in the short term_ they said_ the ruling and subsequent challenges to it “will add significant uncertainty to the mix_ making it even harder for U.S. businesses to plan.”  That suggests markets could continue to veer up and down on tariff developments_ as investors now parse court rulings and appeals in addition to Mr. Trump’s threats_ delays and concessions.

325955376,May 28 (UPI) -- Elon Musk_ who personally spent $277 million to bring Donald Trump back to the White House_ said Wednesday night he is leaving the Trump administration after working to slash the size of the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency.  Musk_ the world's richest man with a net worth of $421.2 billion_ according to Forbes_ can work for 130 days in a calendar year as a special employee. His full-time tenure would end on Friday after joining Trump in the White House for the Jan. 20 inauguration.  Musk posted to X_ the social media platform he owns: "As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end_ I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government."  Musk told reporters earlier this week that he plans to focus more on his businesses: Tesla_ SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI_ which now includes X.  Musk said he will keep a small office in the White House as an unofficial adviser.  During a Tesla earnings call in April_ Musk said he would spend a "day or two per week" on government work until the end of Trump's term in January 2029.  There are around 100 DOGE employees_ including many embedded in agencies. Their status wasn't announced.  Musk told reporters last week that he had worked in Washington_ D.C._ on his DOGE initiative "seven days a week_ or close to seven days a week" during Trump's first 100 days in office. He frequently traveled on Air Force One with Trump to the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach_ Fla._ and recently to the Middle East.  This has meant less attention to his companies_ including publicly held Tesla_ the company that makes electric vehicles_ solar panels/shingles and energy storage devices.  "It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side_ and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks_" he said in an interview with Ars Technica.  Tesla released its first-quarter financial data on April 22.  Tesla's revenue was its lowest in three years: $19.3 billion total_ down 9% compared with the same time last year. The company's profit was $3.15 billion_ which is a 15% decline. And its earnings of 27 cents a share was a drop of 70% from 45 cents a year ago.  In the first quarter_ Tesla produced more than 362_000 vehicles.  On Wednesday_ pension fund leaders sent a letter to Tesla's board demanding that Musk must put in 40 hours per week_ at a minimum_ to attain any future CEO pay package.  Protests were mounted at dealerships nationwide as people opposed Musk's program and worker cuts.  He said his efforts have been far more challenging than expected and DOGE had become "the whipping boy for everything."  During an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday_ Musk said "something bad would happen anywhere_ and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it. People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That's really uncool."  Musk originally said he would slash $2 trillion in spending but now he says $175 billion in taxpayer money has been saved but experts say that number is greatly inflated.  He also became at odds with Trump on Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package going through Congress.  "I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk told CBS Sunday Morning. "I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_ but I don't know if it can be both."  He spoke to reporters from SpaceX headquarters in Texas before Tuesday night's Starship test flight.  "People want to have the chill vibes_ and SpaceX is sort of ultra hardcore. But if we're not ultra hardcore_ how are we going to get to Mars? You're not going to get to Mars in 40 hours a week_" Musk told The Post.  Besides sending astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station_ SpaceX has launched 8_774 Starlink satellites from Florida and California since May 2019.  Starlink is used by several federal agencies_ including the State Department_ Coast Guard_ Interior Department and the Space Force. The Federal Aviation Administration is exploring whether to use Starlink to replace its aging telecommunications system.
325964290,By AARON BEARD AP Sports Writer  RALEIGH_ N.C. — Carter Verhaeghe broke a tie off a feed from Aleksander Barkov with 7:39 left and the defending champion Florida Panthers advanced to their third straight Stanley Cup Final_ beating the Carolina Hurricanes_ 5-3_ on Wednesday night in Game 5.  The Panthers beat the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference final for the second time in three seasons. The Panthers will face the winner of the Western final between Edmonton and Dallas_ with the Oilers leading 3-1 in that best-of-seven series to put them within a win of a rematch with Florida for the Cup.  Sam Bennett added an empty-net goal with 54 seconds left by skating down a loose puck straight out of the penalty box after Florida had held up against a critical late power play for the Hurricanes.  That capped a wild night that saw the Hurricanes jump to a 2-0 lead_ then Florida answer with three second-period goals_ only to see Carolina’s Seth Jarvis beat Sergei Bobrovsky midway through the third to tie it at 3.  When it was over_ the Panthers posed for pictures on Carolina’s home ice during the presentation of the Prince of Wales Trophy for the conference winner. Some Hurricanes fans remained defiant_ offering scattered “Let’s go_ Oilers!” chants.  The angst is appropriate considering how Florida has now twice ended Carolina’s push to its first Cup Final since winning the franchise’s lone title in 2006 when now-coach Rod Brind’Amour was captain.  Florida had won the first three games of this series but lost 3-0 at home Monday night as the Hurricanes averted a second straight sweep against Florida. But by the final horn Wednesday_ the Panthers had won all three games in Raleigh in the series_ pushed their road winning streak in these playoffs to five games and earned an eighth postseason road win overall.  Matthew Tkachuk_ Evan Rodrigues and Anton Lundell scored on consecutive shots during Florida’s second-period flurry_ while Bobrovsky finished with 20 saves.  Barkov’s assist on Verhaeghe’s winner also stood out as its own terrific individual effort. Florida’s captain was jostling with Carolina’s Dmitry Orlov in a battle near the boards on the left side when he turned toward the crease_ stepped inside of Eric Robinson and sent the puck over to Verhaeghe for the finish that silenced a Hurricanes home crowd in full-throated roar after Jarvis’ tying score.  Sebastian Aho scored twice in the first period for Carolina_ both on neutral-zone giveaways – the first being one from Gustav Forsling that hit Aho in stride for a a breakaway chance that ended up in the net. Aho added another off a giveaway from Niko Mikkola with little more than a minute left in the first for a 2-0 lead.  Carolina has won at least one postseason series in its current run of seven straight playoff appearances_ though three have now ended in the Eastern final.  More to come on this story.
325949166,Sean Duffy first made a name for himself in 1997 as a housemate on The Real World: Boston.  He shares nine children with The Real World: San Francisco alum Rachel Campos-Duffy_ whom he met competing on Road Rules: All Stars in 1998 and married the following year.  Duffy spent eight years as Ashland County District Attorney in his home state of Wisconsin before serving in Congress from 2011 to 2019. He resigned from office that August_ citing his yet-to-be-born ninth child's health issues.  "After she’s born_ whether it’s two to six months after life_ she’s going to need open-heart surgery_" he explained on Fox & Friends. "They gotta crack her open and fix the heart."  Duffy added_ "I love politics_ but I love my family_ and I think it’s always a balance. The schedules are grueling. I’m out in D.C. four days a week_ and then I’m back with Rachel." Traveling around his district meeting people_ he said_ "we get beat up a little bit as members of Congress. We’re a favorite punching bag."  On The Real World_ "I was forced to live with people who were so different than me_" he told NCTA in May 2019. "When I first got there_ I saw the stark differences I had with my roommates. But when I left_ I realized I had way more in common with them than I ever imagined."  He compared the experience to crossing the aisle in Congress: "It's amazing the kind of legislation you can work on together and how many points of agreement you actually have."
325938970,President Trump on Wednesday commuted the sentence of notorious former Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover_ who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover_ 74_ the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples_ was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for the 1973 murder of 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer William "Pooky" Young_ when he was convicted of federal charges in 1997_ and sentenced to six life terms. Hoover was among 39 Gangster Disciples leaders indicted in August 1995 in Operation Headache_ a six-year effort by the feds to infiltrate Gangster Disciples. Federal prosecutors had accused him of leading a criminal enterprise to continue overseeing the gang while in prison in Illinois. Hoover is currently serving six life sentences in a maximum security prison in Colorado_ according to federal prison records. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody_ but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois_ dating back to 1973 for Young's murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at ADX Florence_ a maximum security prison in Colorado that they described as "the most restrictive_ draconian supermax prison in the United States."In a statement_ Hoover's attorneys_ Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore_ said they are "thrilled" to see he will be released from federal custody. "The Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover's considerable growth and complete rehabilitation. Despite the Court's unwillingness to do the right thing_ Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters. Thankfully_ Mr. Hoover's pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover."When Hoover was up for parole by the State of Illinois in 2022_ his parole was denied. An Illinois Department of Corrections order says Hoover would have to be turned over to the state to serve the remainder of his state sentence if released from federal custody. In 1993_ Hoover spoke to former CBS News Chicago reporter John Davis. At the time_ Hoover was 42 years old and had already served 20 years in prison."I've done my time_" Hoover said in the 1993 interview. "I paid my debt to society."In the interview with Davis_ the leader of the Gangster Disciples and convicted murderer he'd had a lot of time to think about ways to stop the gang violence on the streets of Chicago."One teenager don't like the other teenager because of the way he wear his hat_ because his ideology is different from his; a Disciple don't like a Vice Lord_" Hoover said in the interview. "We're all Black people. There's no difference."At that time_ Hoover_ also known as King Larry_ admitted being part of a fragile gang truce in the city and organizing a protest over plans to close healthcare clinics in African American neighborhoods. Ron Safer_ the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial_ expressed disappointment in the news of Hoover's sentence being commuted. "I was disappointed_" Safer said. "I do not think that this is an appropriate end to the Larry Hoover story â at least the federal part of it."Safer said Hoover was perhaps the most notorious criminal the state of Illinois has ever known. "He was convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise that had approximately 30_000 members across 28 states_ selling over $100 million worth of drugs in the state of Illinois alone each year_" said Safer_ "and he ran that entire operation with ruthless efficiency from prison_ where he was serving a state sentence for double murder."Safer also emphasized that about Hoover had been recorded saying teenagers needed to sell drugs for his criminal organization. The recording was made a year after the Gangster Disciples leader was interviewed on CBS Chicago."There was another tape where Larry Hoover said_ 'You have to share your drugs with these children â and I'm talking about 12 years old_ 13 years old_ 14 years old â so that they can sell it_ and they can have something'_" Safter said_ "and he said_ 'Make them know that with you_ they are somebody_ and without you_ they are nobody.'"Again_ Safer said those comments were made by Hoover after the Gangster Disciples said he was redeemed_ and said he understood that all of the violence in the city should be stopped.

327172888,The authorities said they were investigating an attack in Boulder_ Colo._ on Sunday as an act of terrorism_ after a man used a “makeshift flamethrower” to attack demonstrators honoring Israeli hostages in Gaza.  Six people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries_ and two of them were in serious condition_ officials said.  Witnesses said the man threw an incendiary device into the crowd in a downtown pedestrian mall_ according to the authorities. The suspect_ identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs_ yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack_ the witnesses said. Mr. Soliman_ 45_ had not been charged as of late Sunday night.  The attack may intensify deep unease in the Jewish community in the United States. In recent months_ two Israeli embassy aides were murdered in Washington_ and a man set fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania_ who is Jewish.
327326166,By LINDSAY WHITEHURST_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — A split Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a challenge to a state ban on assault weapons_ semiautomatic rifles that are popular among gun owners and that have also been used in multiple mass shootings.  The majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the case_ as is typical. But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement_ and a fourth said he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional.  Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken the case_ and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.  “I would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America_” Thomas wrote. “That question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR–15 owners throughout the country.”  Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now_ but he said that he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue “in the next term or two.”  The Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15_ one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.  Several states have similar measures_ and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15.  The case comes three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country.  Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws_ covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004.

327393126,The man accused of injuring eight people Sunday on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall with a “makeshift flamethrower” and Molotov cocktails researched and planned the attack for more than a year_ according to federal court documents.  Mohamed Sabry Soliman_ a 45-year-old man whom federal officials said was living in Colorado illegally at the time of the attack_ has been charged with a federal hate crime_ according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest affidavit.  Soliman threw two lit Molotov cocktails at the crowd of Run for Their Lives demonstrators_ burning eight people_ the affidavit stated. Investigators found another box with at least 14 unlit Molotov cocktails inside nearby.  Run for Their Lives is a national movement calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The local Boulder chapter was hosting their weekly walk on Pearl Street when they were attacked by Soliman outside of the courthouse.  The walk was scheduled for 1 p.m. Soliman told federal officials he arrived at 12:55 p.m. and waited for them to arrive.  “No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin_ and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice_” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”  The Molotov cocktails were made with bottles and jars_ contained clear liquid and had red rags hanging out_ according to the document. A backpack weed sprayer was also discovered near the box of explosives.  Federal officials said the jars and weed sprayer were all filled with gasoline.  Soliman told investigators that he planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives chapter_ which he called a “Zionist group_” federal officials said.

327230032,Nationalist Karol Nawrocki_ backed by U.S. President Donald Trump_ clinched the Polish presidency in a tight run-off race that spells trouble for the country's current pro-EU government.  A final count showed Nawrocki_ who stood for the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost its majority in 2023_ secured 50.89% of votes against the 49.11% of rival Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Early results released before polls closed had put the liberal in the lead.  Nawrocki will succeed fellow conservative Andrzej Duda — who himself won the leadership with a razor-thin advantage against Trzaskowski in 2020 — for a five-year term and can then stand for re-election once.   The Polish election was closely watched in Europe_ the United States and battling Eastern European neighbors Russia and Ukraine as it raises questions over the solidity of Warsaw's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv.  The head of state's role in Poland is overshadowed by that of parliament_ but the president retains a critical veto over legislation. Duda has exercised this to block several reforms spearheaded by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition.  Eurosceptic Nawrocki can likewise deliver considerable setbacks to former European Council President Tusk's pro-EU government_ which repaired fractured relations with Brussels and last year unlocked payments of up to 137 billion euros ($156 billion) of EU funds that had been frozen over rule-of-law concerns.  The country of 37 million and the EU's sixth-largest economy was the largest net beneficiary of EU funds in 2024.  "I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland. We are all stronger together in our community of peace_ democracy_ and values_" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Monday on the X social media platform. "So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home."   A previously staunch supporter of Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion to date_ Poland has offered extensive security and logistical aid to Kyiv and earlier in January assumed the rotating one-year EU presidency from the Kremlin's chief European ally Hungary under the motto "Security_ Europe!"  Nawrocki has taken a more critical stance toward Kyiv during his campaign_ citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's alleged poor treatment of Poland. He also ruled out the embattled country's long-held ambition of adhering to NATO — a move feared to pit the military coalition against Russian hostilities.
327235828,Chinese authorities on Monday accused the U.S. of violating a recent trade pact that both agreed to in Geneva last month_ as they dismissed President Donald Trump’s allegation about Beijing breaching the agreement_ a move that could signal a further escalation in trade tensions between the two countries_ which could potentially jeopardize last month’s tariff truce.  China's Commerce Ministry accused the U.S. of violating a trade deal agreed in Geneva by imposing ... More additional chip restrictions and canceling Chinese student visas. AFP via Getty Images  In a press briefing_ a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson dismissed Trump’s comments accusing China of violating the agreement_ saying Beijing has worked “to strictly implement and actively safeguard the Geneva deal.”  The spokesperson noted that China had acted in accordance with the deal to cancel or suspend “relevant tariffs and non-tariff measures” it had taken as retaliation against the U.S. government’s reciprocal tariffs.  The spokesperson then accused the U.S. of introducing “ a number of discriminatory restrictive measures against China” after the talks_ citing expanded export controls on AI chips and other chip-building technology.  The official also criticized the U.S. government’s crackdown on Chinese student visas_ saying these actions violated the consensus reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on January 17.  The spokesperson then warned that if the U.S. continues to take actions that damage China_ Beijing will “take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”  What Had Trump Said About China Violating The Geneva Deal?  In a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday_ Trump said: “China_ perhaps not surprisingly to some_ HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US_” without specifying how it had done so. The president then signalled that the U.S. may retaliate against this alleged non-compliance_ saying: “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” In his post_ the president claimed his tariffs had put China in “grave economic danger” and he made a “FAST DEAL” in Geneva_ “in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation.”  What Do We Know About The Current State Of U.s.-China Trade Talks?  In an interview with Fox News last week_ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that trade talks with China were “a bit stalled_” but said he believes U.S. officials will be “having more talks with them in the next few weeks.” Bessent did not specify any sticking points that have prevented the talks from progressing_ but noted that he believes a direct call between Trump and Xi will be needed to close the deal. “I think that given the magnitude of the talks_ given the complexity_ that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other_” the treasury secretary said. Bessent then added that Trump and Xi have a “very good relationship” and he was “confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known.”  Key Background  U.S. and Chinese officials met in Geneva last month to discuss a resolution to a spiraling trade war between the two countries_ triggered by President Donald Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs.” After the meeting both sides announced they had agreed to significantly cut back tariffs placed on each other’s goods for at least 90 days_ while continuing discussions on a broader trade deal. As part of the agreement_ both sides agreed to lower their “reciprocal tariffs” on each other from 125% to 10%. However_ a separate 20% tariff on Chinese goods imposed by Trump earlier this year—over China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis in the U.S.—would remain in effect_ keeping the overall tariffs on Chinese goods at 30%. The talks came after both sides engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war which saw U.S. levies on China hit 145% while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were raised to 125%. While announcing the deal_ Bessent acknowledged that the spiraling tariffs were equivalent to a trade embargo and said “neither side wants that.”  What To Watch For  No meetings have taken place between the two sides since the Geneva talks. In their joint statement_ both sides had agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations.” Bessent and Greer will represent the U.S. side in these discussions_ while Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side. These future talks were set to be held alternately in China and the U.S. or in a third country that both sides agree upon. It is unclear how these proposed meetings will be handled amid the latest round of tensions. After the Geneva deal announcement_ Trump also said he was looking forward to talk with Xi_ but that also hasn’t happened so far.

327173224,WARSAW_ Poland — Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election_ according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski_ who received 49.11%.  The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday_ revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.  An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later.  The outcome indicates that Poland can be expected to take a more nationalist path under its new leader_ who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.  The role of a president in Poland  Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However_ the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and to veto legislation.  Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda_ a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.  A headache for Tusk  Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 at the end of a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide — so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises_ such as loosening the restrictive abortion law.  But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.  Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises_ which he had made both to voters and to the EU.  A former boxer_ historian and political novice  Nawrocki_ a 42-year-old historian_ was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.  The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023_ when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback_ and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.  Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance_ which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland_ and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list_ according to Polish media reports.  Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional_ patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends_ including LGBTQ+ visibility_ have embraced him_ viewing him as a reflection of the traditional values they grew up with.  The Trump factor  Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.  The conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland last week to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem_ the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally_ strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.  The U.S. has about 10_000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.  A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore "normality_" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies_ and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.
327140658,Two Oregon high school athletes refused to share the podium with a transgender competitor at the state’s track and field championships_ footage shows.  The female students — Tigard High School’s Alexa Anderson and Sherwood High School’s Reese Eckard — stepped down from the high jump podium as the winners of the competition were being announced across the Eugene stadium Saturday night.  Anderson and Eckard had finished in third and fourth place_ while Ida B. Wells High School’s trans student Lia Rose tied for fifth.  Rose had competed in boys’ track and field divisions as recently as 2024 and 2023_ according to Fox News.  Crowds were cheering for the athletes throughout the ceremony_ and it remains unclear how the audience reacted to the protest.  A race official showed up shortly after Anderson and Eckard stepped down and ushered them away as they stood with their backs to the podium.  It remains unclear if their standing at the competition was affected by the move.  But the incident quickly gained attention online_ especially after women’s sports advocate Riley Gaines — who is staunchly opposed to transgender athletes competing in women’s sports — posted footage from it on X.  “Watch this. Two female athletes in Oregon refused to stand on the podium because a boy was awarded a place_” Gaines wrote.   “Girls have had enough_” she added.  The video was also picked up by other accounts — including “Libs of TikTok” — which praised the athletes’ act of defiance.  It was just the latest incident where women’s athletes have protested against transgender competitors in their division.   In April_ women’s fencer Stephanie Turner took a knee rather than competing with a trans person during a Maryland match_ and was put on a year-long probation by USA Fencing for the move.  And in May_ 16-year-old high schooler Reese Hogan finished second to a trans athlete in California’s CIF Southern Section Finals triple jump competition — but stepped up to the first place spot on the podium after her competitor stepped down.
327320366,By SAM McNEIL_ Associated Press  BARCELONA_ Spain (AP) — The European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration’s surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.  EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal_ but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side_” European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.  “In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome_ the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures_ including in response to this latest tariff increase_” Gill said.  He said the EU is finalizing an “expanded list of countermeasures” that would “automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier.” That’s the date when a 90-day pause_ intended to ease negotiations_ ends in tariffs announced by the two economic powerhouses on each other. About halfway through that grace period_ Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.  Trump’s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs_ with levies threatened_ added and_ often_ taken away. Top officials at the EU’s executive commission says they’re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods. Negotiations will next continue on Wednesday in Paris in a meeting between the EU’s top trade negotiator_ Maroš Šefčovič_ and his counterpart_ U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.  The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S._ as well as lower duties on cars_ but it isn’t likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — or open up the EU to American beef.  The EU has offered the U.S. a “zero for zero” outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides for industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that but EU officials have said it’s still on the table.  The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are also so ubiquitous in packaging that they’re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.
327343944,Washington â The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term_ which begins in October_ with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time_ place and manner of federal elections.If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue_ their lawsuit could proceed. The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted. Bost_ who was first elected to Congress in 2014_ and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes_ infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments_ and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023_ finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue_ a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year_ agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court_ arguing that in recent years_ the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts."The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations_" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court_ adding that it is "vitally important" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court."It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time_ place_ and manner regulations affecting their elections_" the Republicans wrote. "Aside from the interests of the litigants_ it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly_ not arbitrary_ fashion."But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal_ arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day_ but arrive after."They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future_" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. "Rather_ petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates_ on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time_ place_ and manner of conducting an election."
