225109966,Scottie Scheffler is a free man. Early on Friday_ May 17_ the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) placed Scheffler under arrest and charged him with four crimes_ which included assaulting a police officer to the second degree�a felony. However_ a report from Terry Meiners_ a radio personality from Louisville_ Kentucky_ indicates that police will drop these charges. This announcement comes six days after Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel addressed the media and released two videos that detailed the incident. Another press conference featuring Jefferson County Attorney Mike O�Connell and Scheffler�s defense attorney_ Steve Romines_ is set for Wednesday. Since this session with media is scheduled five days before Scheffler�s arraignment_ early indications pointed to prosecutors dropping this case altogether. It makes sense for them to do so_ considering the videos released made things look as if Scheffler did nothing wrong. Scheffler tried maneuvering around traffic and entering Valhalla�s front gates before his second-round tee time that morning. A tragic fatal accident had occurred earlier_ thus leading to the logjam and an increased police presence. But the two-time Masters champion did not realize that someone had lost their life. He only wanted to get to the course to warm up. Other PGA Tour players admitted to doing the same thing_ but Scheffler had a �big miscommunication� with the police. Given the time of day and the rainy conditions_ eyewitnesses on the scene_ namely ESPN�s Jeff Darlington_ who broke the story_ also reported how difficult it was to see. Another video released early Wednesday also included Scheffler�s perspective. Within that_ Scheffler initially did not realize that the officer directing traffic was a police officer. Nevertheless_ it looks as if everyone involved in this case can move on from the matter. Jack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation�s Playing Through.

225012756,Giant pandas are set to return to the National Zoo in Washington_ D.C._ by the end of the year_ officials announced Wednesday. China will send a new pair of giant pandas_ male Bao Li and female Qing Bao_ under a 10-year breeding and research agreement_ the zoo said in a press release. Both bears are 2 years old. �We�re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears_ including a descendent of our beloved panda family_ to Washington_ D.C._� the zoo�s director_ Brandie Smith_ said in a release. �This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact. Through this partnership_ we have grown the panda population_ advanced our shared understanding of how to care for this beloved bear and learned what�s needed to protect wild pandas and preserve native habitat.� Chinese ambassador Xie Feng is scheduled to make brief remarks on Wednesday morning. Smith and other zoo officials are set to address the media_ as well_ the zoo said in a press release. The announcement comes six months after the National Zoo�s three iconic pandas returned to China as a conservation agreement expired_ leaving just a few pandas in United States zoos. In February_ China announced plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. One of the bears headed to D.C. has family ties to the National Zoo�s panda family. Bao Li is the offspring of Bao Bao_ who was born at the National Zoo in 2013. That makes Bao Li the grandchild of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian_ the zoo said. The name means "treasure" and "energetic" in Mandarin Chinese. The female bear_ Qing Bao_ was born in China on Sept. 12_ 2021_ the zoo said. Her name means "green" and "treasure_" the zoo said. Giant pandas were a staple at D.C.�s National Zoo for over 50 years The National Zoo�s longstanding resident pandas_ Tian Tian and Mei Xiang_ departed D.C. last fall_ along with their youngest offspring_ Xiao Qi Ji_ who was born at the zoo in 2020. After an emotional goodbye_ the three went to new homes in the China Wildlife Conservation Association_ leaving the National Zoo's giant panda habitat vacant for the first time in decades. Pandas first arrived at the National Zoo in the 1970s and evolved into D.C.'s unofficial mascots. The black-and-white bears appeared on Metro cards_ street signs and statues around the District. The panda conservation program flourished after Tian Tian and Mei Xiang arrived 20 years ago. Mei Xiang gave birth to four surviving cubs_ Tai Shan_ Bao Bao_ Bei Bei and Xiao Ji Qi � the first panda in the U.S. born after his mother was artificially inseminated with frozen_ instead of fresh_ semen. The agreement keeping Tian Tian and Mei Xiang was extended several times. The panda program has always served as a gesture of friendship and a sort of soft diplomacy between China and the United States_ so the pullback of pandas at the National Zoo and other zoos in the United States caused some concern. Currently_ there are only four pandas in the country � all at Atlanta�s zoo. But in February_ news that China plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo signaled the return of panda diplomacy. Despite the links to U.S.-China diplomacy_ the negotiations are researcher-to-researcher and not based in politics_ Smith_ the National Zoo's director_ told News4 last summer. "We're a bunch of scientists; we're a bunch of animal people_" Smith said. "This is not a political conversation. This is absolutely a conversation between colleagues talking about_ what's best for the overall program_ and also_ what can be best for individual animals?" Want to know what's up for your weekend?

Neither incident merits his recusal_ he wrote. �I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request_� he wrote.

225031922,DETROIT (AP) � Nissan is urging the owners of about 84_000 older vehicles to stop driving them because their Takata air bag inflators have an increased risk of exploding in a crash and hurling dangerous metal fragments. Wednesday�s urgent request comes after one person in a Nissan was killed by an exploding front-passenger inflator_ and as many as 58 people were injured since 2015. �Due to the age of the vehicles equipped with defective Takata air bag inflators_ there is an increased risk the inflator could explode during an air bag deployment_ propelling sharp metal fragments which can cause serious injury or death_� Nissan said in a statement. Nissan said the �do not drive� warning covers certain 2002 through 2006 Sentra small cars_ as well as some 2002 through 2004 Pathfinder SUVs_ and 2002 and 2003 Infiniti QX4 SUVs. Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall or infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers_ and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available. �Even minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering_ gruesome injuries_� the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. �Older model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk_ as the age of the air bag is one of the contributing factors.� Nissan originally recalled 736_422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84_000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators. The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018_ the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra_ according to Nissan. The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators_ which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force_ blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia_ Australia and the U.S. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history_ with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata into bankruptcy. Honda_ Ford_ BMW_ Toyota and Stellantis and Mazda have issued similar �do not drive� warnings for some of their vehicles equipped with Takata inflators.
224779450,NEW YORK � Josh Gibson became Major League Baseball�s career leader with a .372 batting average_ surpassing Ty Cobb�s .367_ when Negro Leagues records for more than 2_300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project. Gibson�s .466 average for the 1943 Homestead Grays became the season standard_ followed by Charlie �Chino� Smith�s .451 for the 1929 New York Lincoln Giants. They overtook the .440 by Hugh Duffy for the National League�s Boston team in 1894. Gibson also became the career leader in slugging percentage (.718) and OPS (1.177)_ moving ahead of Babe Ruth (.690 and 1.164). �This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible_� baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. �Their accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson�s 1947 Dodger debut.� A special committee on baseball records decided in 1969 to recognize six major leagues dating to 1876: the National (which launched in 1876)_ the American (1901)_ the American Association (1882-1891)_ Union Association (1884)_ Players� League (1890)_ and Federal League (1914-1915). It excluded the National Association (1871-75)_ citing an �erratic schedule and procedures.� MLB announced in December 2020 that it would be �correcting a longtime oversight� and would add the Negro Leagues. John Thorn_ MLB�s official historian_ chaired a 17-person committee that included Negro Leagues experts and statisticians. �The condensed 60-game season for the 2020 calendar year for the National League and American League prompted us to think that maybe the shortened Negro League seasons could come under the MLB umbrella_ after all_� Thorn said. An updated version of MLB�s database will become public before the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants play a tribute game to the Negro Leagues on June 20 at Rickwood Field in Birmingham_ Alabama. Baseball Hall of Fame President Josh Rawitch said statistics on Cooperstown plaques would remain the same because they reflect the information available at the time of a player�s induction. Standards for season leaders is the same for Negro Leagues as the other leagues: 3.1 plate appearances or one inning for each game played by a player�s team. Gibson�s .974 slugging percentage in 1937 becomes the season record_ and Barry Bonds� .863 in 2001 dropped to fifth_ also trailing Mules Suttles .877 in 1926_ Gibson�s .871 in 1943 and Smith�s .870 in 1929. Bond�s prior OPS record of 1.421 in 2004 dropped to third behind Gibson�s 1.474 in 1937 and 1.435 in 1943. Willie Mays gained 10 hits from the 1948 Birmingham Black Barons_ increasing his total to 3_293. Minnie Minoso surpassed 2_000 hits_ credited with 150 for the New York Cubans from 1946-1948 that boosted his total to 2_113. Robinson_ who broke MLB�s color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers_ was credited with 49 hits with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs that increased his total to 1_567. Among pitchers_ Satchel Paige gained 28 wins that raised his total to 125. The committee met six times and dealt with issues such as when compiled league statistics didn�t make sense_ such as a league having more wins than losses and walks that were missing. Researchers had to identify whether players with the same name were one person or separate_ tracking dates of birth_ and identify people listed by nicknames. Documenting transactions and identifying ballparks in a time when neutral sites often were used is ongoing_ along with uncovering statistics for independent teams. Kevin Johnson and Gary Ashwill_ researchers who had spent nearly two decades helping assemble the Seamheads Negro Leagues Database_ were included in the project. Thorn estimated 72% of Negro Leagues records from 1920-1948 are included and additional research might lead to future modifications. Thorn said a four-homer game by Gibson in 1938 and a home run by Mays in August 1948 could not be included because complete game accounts have not been found. �Without a box score_ we can�t really balance the statistics_� Johnson said. �Those games are kind of in limbo at the moment.� Records include the first Negro National League (1920-31)_ Eastern Colored League (1923-28)_ American Negro League (1929)_ East-West League (1932)_ Negro Southern League (1932)_ second Negro National League (1933-48) and Negro American League (1937-48). Some game details were obtained from newspapers that covered the Black communities. Johnson said while complete accounts were found for about 95% of games in the 1920s_ coverage dropped off during the Great Depression in the 1930s and never fully recovered.

Here’s how it works.  Elden Ring Nightreign review  Nightreign isn't the Elden Ring co-op experience you'd expect_ but it's kind of brilliant anyway.  Tyler Colp   28 May 2025  (Image: © Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Our Verdict  Elden Ring Nightreign is just as confusing and abrasive as FromSoftware's other games_ but there's really nothing else like it.  PC Gamer's got your back  Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review_ to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.  Need to Know  What is it? A co-op action RPG battle royale hybrid set in the Elden Ring universe Release date May 30_ 2025 Expect to pay $40/£35 Developer FromSoftware Publisher Bandai Namco Reviewed on RTX 5090_ Intel Core i9 12900K_ 16GB RAM Multiplayer Yes Steam Deck Untested Link Official site In the fight against Elden Ring Nightreign's riff on Mothra_ I never expected it would eventually touch down and mount the head of its partner_ a giant stick bug with claws_ like a mech. For the rest of the fight they were operating in unison_ a kaiju cowboy with orbital lasers piercing the sky. That's a problem pesticide can't solve_ but_ as it turns out_ three guys with bows absolutely can.  There's nothing like fighting a boss in a FromSoftware game that is designed to be a joke with you as the punchline—and defying fate with your own ridiculous strategy. Elden Ring Nightreign is a game about losing a fistfight over and over until you luck or strategize your way into an opportunity to bring three guns. The harder you've been hit the more glorious the payback_ and Nightreign is a merciless bully. Even if you've played Elden Ring_ Nightreign will surprise you. Imagine the Lands Between as a stadium filled with familiar monsters and a team of three players as its contestants. It's an action RPG as a sport_ cranked up to two times speed_ and designed to be replayed every 30 minutes. Randomized loot and an ever-tightening battle royale-style circle apply constant pressure that you're only released from at the end of the match_ whether you survive or not.  You may like  Elden Ring Nightreign's story is told in part through playable memories_ so FromSoftware really is delivering lore through whacking things  The First Berserker: Khazan review – Smart soulslike combat and boss design despite somewhat samey missions  Elden Ring Nightreign PC performance analysis: A bare-bones console port with glitches a-plenty  Nightreign is the most peculiar game FromSoft has made since the '90s. It's also its most abrasive.  Even now after putting well over 30 hours into it_ I believe Nightreign is both a trend-defying remix of Elden Ring and also a pile of complete bullshit that I shouldn't have to deal with in the year 2025.  (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods I can't help but respect the fact that it works_ however. Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods_ and yet that is exactly what I've been doing in Nightreign. We've been "looting churches_" "clearing camps_" and "popping crab" for the past week. Some of my most heated_ frustrating moments—like when a boss "invaded" my run to steal entire levels from me before peacing out—were cooled by the fact that I was palling around Elden Ring like it was Fortnite. There were also plenty of times I was convinced that maybe Nightreign is actually a terrible idea. Elden Ring didn't need a time limit_ nor did it need a randomized loot system. The randomization often feels designed—or under-designed—just to screw you over. There's a difference between mistiming a dodge on a fatal attack and spending 10 minutes on a grueling boss fight because the map refused to cough up a holy weapon for a boss who is weak to holy. This game has optional events where you can spend half of a run fighting for a bonus reward that will be irrelevant to the final boss you've targeted for that session—or any boss for that matter. And the ability to meaningfully buildcraft is in constant tension with Nightreign's pace and its UI_ which obfuscates key information around damage scaling and weapon abilities. Do you know the difference between Dragon Communion Incantations and Dragon Cult Incantations? I don't either_ but you have five seconds to figure it out before the circle consumes you. Nightreign is kind of a mess. FromSoftware's inscrutable terminology and uneven balance makes the learning curve much steeper than it needs to be. Or maybe that's the beauty of it: A game not trying to entice you with daily login bonuses or battle passes_ but a language to learn over the course of hundreds of runs. In that way_ it emulates the joys of gaining acuity with any of the studio's other games. But that might also be why the structure of Nightreign falls apart for me. If you hated running back to a boss in Elden Ring_ try doing that with a whole-ass battle royale to survive on the way there. It's hard to enjoy the journey when the destination is the only thing you're meaningfully rewarded for. Each character in Nightreign can equip three Relics with passive benefits that range from unnoticeable (dexterity +2) to game-changing (item effects or healing flasks are shared with all players). Most of them are trash and will have little to no bearing on whether or not you can kill the final boss_ let alone reach them. But that's all that you get to take home after each run. Build-brained  Nightreign's major bosses tend to be extremely mobile_ so get ready to sprint a lot. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware) Nightreign wants you in it for the love of the game_ and while I can appreciate that in a sea of games that practically bribe you to keep playing_ it can also make the routine moments of a run kind of boring. Elden Ring has its punishing sections_ but there's always something else to do. In Nightreign_ you just fight bosses until you're strong enough to fight a different boss. When my team cut down the final one_ I couldn't think of many reasons compelling me to do it all over again. But later_ I watched a recording of the fight and saw that the final sliver of health on a boss we'd attempted at least six times was extinguished by the tiny magical daggers summoned by my sword's passive effect. And that's when the gears started turning. What if I found that weapon again and actually played the right character with the right items to emphasize that technique? What other effects have I ignored that could inspire entirely new strategies? I immediately wanted to go for another run as an experiment.  A rare_ precious item allowing you to revive once after death. Good luck getting one. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. Uh oh. It's possible Nightreign rules_ actually. The combinations of weapons and effects you can put together in a run frequently activate my "RPG build" neurons. Part of the reason we even made it to the point where the final boss was nine magic glintblades away from death is that I discovered the "successive attacks negate damage" passive effect. On most of Nightreign's eight playable characters it's hard to activate_ but it naturally synergizes with the dual-wielding knife specialist Duchess' playstyle. Though she's normally one of the squishiest nightfarers_ a flurry of stabs into a boss and I could tank an attack that would take my teammates out in one hit. Paired with a Relic that automatically activates her skill to repeat damage done to a boss after landing several hits in a row and I was playing an immortal god. The problem is you won't find those buffs every run—or on the right character. But when you do_ the thrill of having that kind of power in a FromSoft game is delicious_ especially when the difficulty is as brutal as Nightreign's. The RNG of it all and the number of bosses standing between you and the end demands a high level of execution and_ frankly_ luck. You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. In Fortnite_ the odds are stacked against you. One hundred players enter a match and only one comes out a winner. In Nightreign the odds are the same_ except most of the time the game wins. This feels backwards to how I've always approached FromSoft games_ but the elation of finally getting a win can be tantalizing. And that's all it takes to pull me back in. It doesn't matter whether it's a silly weapon I want to try again or a different character I want to learn_ like the witch who can yank magic out of enemies to buff her allies. Every time I get a taste of victory_ I forget the misery of spending 30 minutes to lose to a boss and hit the button to do it again anyway. Brutal but brilliant  Lucking into a great weapon drop can make all the struggle feel worth it. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played All of Nightreign's faults fade when the brutal difficulty and the randomized nature of it creates something beautiful_ like when you discover the skeletons summoned by the little necromancer girl can revive you when you're downed. Or when you're fighting a jellyfish god from another planet and your buddy in Skyrim armor screams as he rises into the sky on a giant rock_ saving you from a big attack. Or when you're low on healing flasks and praying for an easy boss and out from the dark portal steps a nightmare from an entirely different game_ one you thought you'd never have to face again. Sometimes Nightreign is so cruel all you can do is laugh as it shoves your nose in the dirt. But then it turns around and delivers catharsis. Everyone cheered in voice chat when Centipede Demon_ the boss nobody remembers from Dark Souls_ showed up to get obliterated by 14 years of action RPG combat advancement. When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played. I just wish it wasn't so hard to play—not because the bosses are tough_ but because of how indifferent it is to helping you experience everything that's so endearing about it. All the work is on you to find something that draws you back in_ to find a reason to try again. For me that's a new build or a new character to focus on with a game-changing Relic setup. For others it can be helping out a friend struggling with the brutal difficulty. And for something as experimental and as weird as Nightreign is_ that might be enough. Nightreign is light on story_ but it carries with it my favorite theme core to all of FromSoft's games: The irresistible nature to persevere against what feels like impossible odds. That I can spend three hours getting pummeled by a game as impenetrable as this and still feel the urge to give it another go has me annoyed that the same trick's working on me again. Nightreign may be kind of a mess_ but it's a mess made just for me.

It doesn't mean you have to accept manipulation and hate and all these things.”   After saying she and her father had the “strongest relationship_” she spoke out against her sibling.   “People will do anything for a little bit of fame or attention_” Savannah claimed_ saying Kyle provides statements about their father on social media and to the press. “What I don't process well is having Kyle play the victim to life circumstances he's created. What I don't do well with someone who has abused people his entire life now trying to play victim_ trying to get people to feel bad for him.”   She continued_ “Yes_ my father has not spoken to him and that is because now_ we are all at a place where we don't have to be abused any further.

325813908,Hamas’s chief in Gaza_ Mohammed Sinwar_ has been killed_ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on May 28.  Speaking before the Knesset_ Israel’s Parliament_ Netanyahu said that the Jewish state has “eliminated Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif_ Yahya Sinwar_ and Mohammed Sinwar.”  Haniyeh was Hamas’s political leader when he was taken out by Israel in Tehran in July 2024.

325587004,Elon Musk says he is "disappointed" by the price tag on the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House last week and heavily backed by President Trump_ the billionaire who recently stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE_ told "CBS Sunday Morning" in an exclusive broadcast interview."I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk said.Musk's comments appear to put him at odds with Mr. Trump_ who has championed the massive spending package. The legislation — which still needs to pass the Senate — would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts_ boost border security spending_ impose work requirements on Medicaid and roll back clean energy tax credits.The tax provisions of the package_ titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" after Mr. Trump's name for the bill_ would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034_ according to the Congressional Budget Office."I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_" Musk told CBS News_ "but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion."Musk was a near-constant presence in the early months of the Trump administration_ with his DOGE staffers sweeping through virtually every government agency to make widespread cuts — drawing concern from Democrats and even some Trump allies_ as well as numerous legal challenges. Musk_ who is also the CEO of Tesla_ SpaceX and the social media platform X_ has said he will dial back his involvement in government.See more of the interview with Elon Musk on "CBS Sunday Morning" on June 1.

325577048,It’s clear that Terry Bradshaw isn’t about to suggest Aaron Rodgers should wear the number 12 jersey for the Steelers. It’s even more obvious that Rodgers wouldn’t agree to it.  Bradshaw was blunt_ as he often is_ regarding the Steelers’ decision to wait indefinitely on Rodgers.  “That’s ridiculous_” Bradshaw remarked on 103.7 The Buzz in Little Rock_ Arkansas (as reported by CBSSports.com). “I find that notion laughable. What_ bring him in for just a single season? Are you serious? . . . . He should remain in California. Head out there_ munch on some tree bark_ and have conversations with the spirits.”  Bradshaw believes the Steelers should have given 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett more of a chance.  “I was a fan of Kenny Pickett_” Bradshaw mentioned. “I appreciated his play at Pitt. I know him and understand his character. When Pittsburgh got him_ here’s what they failed to do: They didn’t offer him protection…they didn’t provide a solid offensive line. They were focused on running the ball without a line capable of proper defense_ and they also lacked weapons. He virtually had no notable wide receivers.”  “And then they throw a kid in there for two years and you’ve got an offense that doesn’t fit and doesn’t work_ and they can’t run because their offensive line’s not even good enough for a run blocking team. And therefore they say Pickett was a failure. He wasn’t a failure_ the Steelers were a failure.”  The Steelers are willing to give Rodgers as much time as he wants because they believe_ with Rodgers at quarterback_ they won’t fail in 2025.   It all depends on what counts as success. Making the playoffs? Winning a playoff game? Getting to the conference championship?  Rodgers simply needs a season strong enough to cause his 2024 experience with the Jets to be viewed as an aberration. The Steelers and their fans could be aiming a lot higher than that.
325708928,May 28 (UPI) -- The Czech Republic accused China on Wednesday of being responsible for a "malicious cyber campaign" that targeted an unclassified network of the foreign ministry.  Little information about the cyberattack was made public_ the Czech government said it began in 2022_ affected an institution designated as Czech critical infrastructure and that it was perpetrated by well-known China-backed hackers APT31.  "The Government of the Czech Republic strongly condemns this malicious cyber campaign against its critical infrastructure_" the Czech foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.  "Such behavior undermines the credibility of the People's Republic of China and contradicts its public declarations."  APT31_ which stands for Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31_ is a collection of China state-sponsored intelligence officers_ contract hackers and support staff that conduct cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government.  Seven Chinese nationals were charged in the United States in late March for their involvement in APT31_ which federal prosecutors said has targeted U.S. and foreign critics of the Chinese government_ business_ and political officials over the last 14 years.  The Czech government said Wednesday it tied APT31 to the cyberattack through an "extensive investigation_" which "led to a high degree of certainty about the responsible actor."  "The Government of the Czech Republic has identified the People's Republic of China as being responsible_" it said.  NATO and the European Union -- both of which Czech is a member of -- were quick to condemn China following Prague's revelation.  "We stand in solidarity with the Czech Republic following the malicious cyber campaign against its Ministry of Foreign Affairs_" the security alliance said in a statement.  NATO did not blame China but acknowledged the Czechs' accusation of Beijing for the attack and said that it has observed "with increasing concern the growing pattern of malicious cyber activities stemming from the People's Republic of China."  Similarly_ the EU did not directly point the finger at China for the attack on the Czech Republic_ but said there have been cyberattacks linked to Beijing targeting EU and its member stats.  "In 2021_ we urged Chinese authorities to take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from their territories. Since then_ several Member States have attributed similar activities at their national level_" the EU's high representative_ Kaja Kallas_ said in a statement.  "We have repeatedly raised our concerns during bilateral engagements and we will continue to do so in the future."
