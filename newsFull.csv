225109966,Scottie Scheffler is a free man. Early on Friday_ May 17_ the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) placed Scheffler under arrest and charged him with four crimes_ which included assaulting a police officer to the second degree�a felony. However_ a report from Terry Meiners_ a radio personality from Louisville_ Kentucky_ indicates that police will drop these charges. This announcement comes six days after Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel addressed the media and released two videos that detailed the incident. Another press conference featuring Jefferson County Attorney Mike O�Connell and Scheffler�s defense attorney_ Steve Romines_ is set for Wednesday. Since this session with media is scheduled five days before Scheffler�s arraignment_ early indications pointed to prosecutors dropping this case altogether. It makes sense for them to do so_ considering the videos released made things look as if Scheffler did nothing wrong. Scheffler tried maneuvering around traffic and entering Valhalla�s front gates before his second-round tee time that morning. A tragic fatal accident had occurred earlier_ thus leading to the logjam and an increased police presence. But the two-time Masters champion did not realize that someone had lost their life. He only wanted to get to the course to warm up. Other PGA Tour players admitted to doing the same thing_ but Scheffler had a �big miscommunication� with the police. Given the time of day and the rainy conditions_ eyewitnesses on the scene_ namely ESPN�s Jeff Darlington_ who broke the story_ also reported how difficult it was to see. Another video released early Wednesday also included Scheffler�s perspective. Within that_ Scheffler initially did not realize that the officer directing traffic was a police officer. Nevertheless_ it looks as if everyone involved in this case can move on from the matter. Jack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation�s Playing Through.

225012756,Giant pandas are set to return to the National Zoo in Washington_ D.C._ by the end of the year_ officials announced Wednesday. China will send a new pair of giant pandas_ male Bao Li and female Qing Bao_ under a 10-year breeding and research agreement_ the zoo said in a press release. Both bears are 2 years old. �We�re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears_ including a descendent of our beloved panda family_ to Washington_ D.C._� the zoo�s director_ Brandie Smith_ said in a release. �This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact. Through this partnership_ we have grown the panda population_ advanced our shared understanding of how to care for this beloved bear and learned what�s needed to protect wild pandas and preserve native habitat.� Chinese ambassador Xie Feng is scheduled to make brief remarks on Wednesday morning. Smith and other zoo officials are set to address the media_ as well_ the zoo said in a press release. The announcement comes six months after the National Zoo�s three iconic pandas returned to China as a conservation agreement expired_ leaving just a few pandas in United States zoos. In February_ China announced plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. One of the bears headed to D.C. has family ties to the National Zoo�s panda family. Bao Li is the offspring of Bao Bao_ who was born at the National Zoo in 2013. That makes Bao Li the grandchild of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian_ the zoo said. The name means "treasure" and "energetic" in Mandarin Chinese. The female bear_ Qing Bao_ was born in China on Sept. 12_ 2021_ the zoo said. Her name means "green" and "treasure_" the zoo said. Giant pandas were a staple at D.C.�s National Zoo for over 50 years The National Zoo�s longstanding resident pandas_ Tian Tian and Mei Xiang_ departed D.C. last fall_ along with their youngest offspring_ Xiao Qi Ji_ who was born at the zoo in 2020. After an emotional goodbye_ the three went to new homes in the China Wildlife Conservation Association_ leaving the National Zoo's giant panda habitat vacant for the first time in decades. Pandas first arrived at the National Zoo in the 1970s and evolved into D.C.'s unofficial mascots. The black-and-white bears appeared on Metro cards_ street signs and statues around the District. The panda conservation program flourished after Tian Tian and Mei Xiang arrived 20 years ago. Mei Xiang gave birth to four surviving cubs_ Tai Shan_ Bao Bao_ Bei Bei and Xiao Ji Qi � the first panda in the U.S. born after his mother was artificially inseminated with frozen_ instead of fresh_ semen. The agreement keeping Tian Tian and Mei Xiang was extended several times. The panda program has always served as a gesture of friendship and a sort of soft diplomacy between China and the United States_ so the pullback of pandas at the National Zoo and other zoos in the United States caused some concern. Currently_ there are only four pandas in the country � all at Atlanta�s zoo. But in February_ news that China plans to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo signaled the return of panda diplomacy. Despite the links to U.S.-China diplomacy_ the negotiations are researcher-to-researcher and not based in politics_ Smith_ the National Zoo's director_ told News4 last summer. "We're a bunch of scientists; we're a bunch of animal people_" Smith said. "This is not a political conversation. This is absolutely a conversation between colleagues talking about_ what's best for the overall program_ and also_ what can be best for individual animals?" Want to know what's up for your weekend?

Neither incident merits his recusal_ he wrote. �I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request_� he wrote.

225031922,DETROIT (AP) � Nissan is urging the owners of about 84_000 older vehicles to stop driving them because their Takata air bag inflators have an increased risk of exploding in a crash and hurling dangerous metal fragments. Wednesday�s urgent request comes after one person in a Nissan was killed by an exploding front-passenger inflator_ and as many as 58 people were injured since 2015. �Due to the age of the vehicles equipped with defective Takata air bag inflators_ there is an increased risk the inflator could explode during an air bag deployment_ propelling sharp metal fragments which can cause serious injury or death_� Nissan said in a statement. Nissan said the �do not drive� warning covers certain 2002 through 2006 Sentra small cars_ as well as some 2002 through 2004 Pathfinder SUVs_ and 2002 and 2003 Infiniti QX4 SUVs. Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall or infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers_ and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available. �Even minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering_ gruesome injuries_� the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. �Older model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk_ as the age of the air bag is one of the contributing factors.� Nissan originally recalled 736_422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84_000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators. The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018_ the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra_ according to Nissan. The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators_ which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force_ blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia_ Australia and the U.S. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history_ with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata into bankruptcy. Honda_ Ford_ BMW_ Toyota and Stellantis and Mazda have issued similar �do not drive� warnings for some of their vehicles equipped with Takata inflators.
224779450,NEW YORK � Josh Gibson became Major League Baseball�s career leader with a .372 batting average_ surpassing Ty Cobb�s .367_ when Negro Leagues records for more than 2_300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project. Gibson�s .466 average for the 1943 Homestead Grays became the season standard_ followed by Charlie �Chino� Smith�s .451 for the 1929 New York Lincoln Giants. They overtook the .440 by Hugh Duffy for the National League�s Boston team in 1894. Gibson also became the career leader in slugging percentage (.718) and OPS (1.177)_ moving ahead of Babe Ruth (.690 and 1.164). �This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible_� baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. �Their accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson�s 1947 Dodger debut.� A special committee on baseball records decided in 1969 to recognize six major leagues dating to 1876: the National (which launched in 1876)_ the American (1901)_ the American Association (1882-1891)_ Union Association (1884)_ Players� League (1890)_ and Federal League (1914-1915). It excluded the National Association (1871-75)_ citing an �erratic schedule and procedures.� MLB announced in December 2020 that it would be �correcting a longtime oversight� and would add the Negro Leagues. John Thorn_ MLB�s official historian_ chaired a 17-person committee that included Negro Leagues experts and statisticians. �The condensed 60-game season for the 2020 calendar year for the National League and American League prompted us to think that maybe the shortened Negro League seasons could come under the MLB umbrella_ after all_� Thorn said. An updated version of MLB�s database will become public before the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants play a tribute game to the Negro Leagues on June 20 at Rickwood Field in Birmingham_ Alabama. Baseball Hall of Fame President Josh Rawitch said statistics on Cooperstown plaques would remain the same because they reflect the information available at the time of a player�s induction. Standards for season leaders is the same for Negro Leagues as the other leagues: 3.1 plate appearances or one inning for each game played by a player�s team. Gibson�s .974 slugging percentage in 1937 becomes the season record_ and Barry Bonds� .863 in 2001 dropped to fifth_ also trailing Mules Suttles .877 in 1926_ Gibson�s .871 in 1943 and Smith�s .870 in 1929. Bond�s prior OPS record of 1.421 in 2004 dropped to third behind Gibson�s 1.474 in 1937 and 1.435 in 1943. Willie Mays gained 10 hits from the 1948 Birmingham Black Barons_ increasing his total to 3_293. Minnie Minoso surpassed 2_000 hits_ credited with 150 for the New York Cubans from 1946-1948 that boosted his total to 2_113. Robinson_ who broke MLB�s color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers_ was credited with 49 hits with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs that increased his total to 1_567. Among pitchers_ Satchel Paige gained 28 wins that raised his total to 125. The committee met six times and dealt with issues such as when compiled league statistics didn�t make sense_ such as a league having more wins than losses and walks that were missing. Researchers had to identify whether players with the same name were one person or separate_ tracking dates of birth_ and identify people listed by nicknames. Documenting transactions and identifying ballparks in a time when neutral sites often were used is ongoing_ along with uncovering statistics for independent teams. Kevin Johnson and Gary Ashwill_ researchers who had spent nearly two decades helping assemble the Seamheads Negro Leagues Database_ were included in the project. Thorn estimated 72% of Negro Leagues records from 1920-1948 are included and additional research might lead to future modifications. Thorn said a four-homer game by Gibson in 1938 and a home run by Mays in August 1948 could not be included because complete game accounts have not been found. �Without a box score_ we can�t really balance the statistics_� Johnson said. �Those games are kind of in limbo at the moment.� Records include the first Negro National League (1920-31)_ Eastern Colored League (1923-28)_ American Negro League (1929)_ East-West League (1932)_ Negro Southern League (1932)_ second Negro National League (1933-48) and Negro American League (1937-48). Some game details were obtained from newspapers that covered the Black communities. Johnson said while complete accounts were found for about 95% of games in the 1920s_ coverage dropped off during the Great Depression in the 1930s and never fully recovered.

Here’s how it works.  Elden Ring Nightreign review  Nightreign isn't the Elden Ring co-op experience you'd expect_ but it's kind of brilliant anyway.  Tyler Colp   28 May 2025  (Image: © Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Our Verdict  Elden Ring Nightreign is just as confusing and abrasive as FromSoftware's other games_ but there's really nothing else like it.  PC Gamer's got your back  Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review_ to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.  Need to Know  What is it? A co-op action RPG battle royale hybrid set in the Elden Ring universe Release date May 30_ 2025 Expect to pay $40/£35 Developer FromSoftware Publisher Bandai Namco Reviewed on RTX 5090_ Intel Core i9 12900K_ 16GB RAM Multiplayer Yes Steam Deck Untested Link Official site In the fight against Elden Ring Nightreign's riff on Mothra_ I never expected it would eventually touch down and mount the head of its partner_ a giant stick bug with claws_ like a mech. For the rest of the fight they were operating in unison_ a kaiju cowboy with orbital lasers piercing the sky. That's a problem pesticide can't solve_ but_ as it turns out_ three guys with bows absolutely can.  There's nothing like fighting a boss in a FromSoftware game that is designed to be a joke with you as the punchline—and defying fate with your own ridiculous strategy. Elden Ring Nightreign is a game about losing a fistfight over and over until you luck or strategize your way into an opportunity to bring three guns. The harder you've been hit the more glorious the payback_ and Nightreign is a merciless bully. Even if you've played Elden Ring_ Nightreign will surprise you. Imagine the Lands Between as a stadium filled with familiar monsters and a team of three players as its contestants. It's an action RPG as a sport_ cranked up to two times speed_ and designed to be replayed every 30 minutes. Randomized loot and an ever-tightening battle royale-style circle apply constant pressure that you're only released from at the end of the match_ whether you survive or not.  You may like  Elden Ring Nightreign's story is told in part through playable memories_ so FromSoftware really is delivering lore through whacking things  The First Berserker: Khazan review – Smart soulslike combat and boss design despite somewhat samey missions  Elden Ring Nightreign PC performance analysis: A bare-bones console port with glitches a-plenty  Nightreign is the most peculiar game FromSoft has made since the '90s. It's also its most abrasive.  Even now after putting well over 30 hours into it_ I believe Nightreign is both a trend-defying remix of Elden Ring and also a pile of complete bullshit that I shouldn't have to deal with in the year 2025.  (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods I can't help but respect the fact that it works_ however. Dropping down into Limtown with the boys is the kind of thing someone would pitch on NexusMods_ and yet that is exactly what I've been doing in Nightreign. We've been "looting churches_" "clearing camps_" and "popping crab" for the past week. Some of my most heated_ frustrating moments—like when a boss "invaded" my run to steal entire levels from me before peacing out—were cooled by the fact that I was palling around Elden Ring like it was Fortnite. There were also plenty of times I was convinced that maybe Nightreign is actually a terrible idea. Elden Ring didn't need a time limit_ nor did it need a randomized loot system. The randomization often feels designed—or under-designed—just to screw you over. There's a difference between mistiming a dodge on a fatal attack and spending 10 minutes on a grueling boss fight because the map refused to cough up a holy weapon for a boss who is weak to holy. This game has optional events where you can spend half of a run fighting for a bonus reward that will be irrelevant to the final boss you've targeted for that session—or any boss for that matter. And the ability to meaningfully buildcraft is in constant tension with Nightreign's pace and its UI_ which obfuscates key information around damage scaling and weapon abilities. Do you know the difference between Dragon Communion Incantations and Dragon Cult Incantations? I don't either_ but you have five seconds to figure it out before the circle consumes you. Nightreign is kind of a mess. FromSoftware's inscrutable terminology and uneven balance makes the learning curve much steeper than it needs to be. Or maybe that's the beauty of it: A game not trying to entice you with daily login bonuses or battle passes_ but a language to learn over the course of hundreds of runs. In that way_ it emulates the joys of gaining acuity with any of the studio's other games. But that might also be why the structure of Nightreign falls apart for me. If you hated running back to a boss in Elden Ring_ try doing that with a whole-ass battle royale to survive on the way there. It's hard to enjoy the journey when the destination is the only thing you're meaningfully rewarded for. Each character in Nightreign can equip three Relics with passive benefits that range from unnoticeable (dexterity +2) to game-changing (item effects or healing flasks are shared with all players). Most of them are trash and will have little to no bearing on whether or not you can kill the final boss_ let alone reach them. But that's all that you get to take home after each run. Build-brained  Nightreign's major bosses tend to be extremely mobile_ so get ready to sprint a lot. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware) Nightreign wants you in it for the love of the game_ and while I can appreciate that in a sea of games that practically bribe you to keep playing_ it can also make the routine moments of a run kind of boring. Elden Ring has its punishing sections_ but there's always something else to do. In Nightreign_ you just fight bosses until you're strong enough to fight a different boss. When my team cut down the final one_ I couldn't think of many reasons compelling me to do it all over again. But later_ I watched a recording of the fight and saw that the final sliver of health on a boss we'd attempted at least six times was extinguished by the tiny magical daggers summoned by my sword's passive effect. And that's when the gears started turning. What if I found that weapon again and actually played the right character with the right items to emphasize that technique? What other effects have I ignored that could inspire entirely new strategies? I immediately wanted to go for another run as an experiment.  A rare_ precious item allowing you to revive once after death. Good luck getting one. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. Uh oh. It's possible Nightreign rules_ actually. The combinations of weapons and effects you can put together in a run frequently activate my "RPG build" neurons. Part of the reason we even made it to the point where the final boss was nine magic glintblades away from death is that I discovered the "successive attacks negate damage" passive effect. On most of Nightreign's eight playable characters it's hard to activate_ but it naturally synergizes with the dual-wielding knife specialist Duchess' playstyle. Though she's normally one of the squishiest nightfarers_ a flurry of stabs into a boss and I could tank an attack that would take my teammates out in one hit. Paired with a Relic that automatically activates her skill to repeat damage done to a boss after landing several hits in a row and I was playing an immortal god. The problem is you won't find those buffs every run—or on the right character. But when you do_ the thrill of having that kind of power in a FromSoft game is delicious_ especially when the difficulty is as brutal as Nightreign's. The RNG of it all and the number of bosses standing between you and the end demands a high level of execution and_ frankly_ luck. You get better at knowing what locations to hit each night_ but if the drops don't serve you_ the run can go sour quickly. In Fortnite_ the odds are stacked against you. One hundred players enter a match and only one comes out a winner. In Nightreign the odds are the same_ except most of the time the game wins. This feels backwards to how I've always approached FromSoft games_ but the elation of finally getting a win can be tantalizing. And that's all it takes to pull me back in. It doesn't matter whether it's a silly weapon I want to try again or a different character I want to learn_ like the witch who can yank magic out of enemies to buff her allies. Every time I get a taste of victory_ I forget the misery of spending 30 minutes to lose to a boss and hit the button to do it again anyway. Brutal but brilliant  Lucking into a great weapon drop can make all the struggle feel worth it. (Image credit: Tyler C. / FromSoftware)  When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played All of Nightreign's faults fade when the brutal difficulty and the randomized nature of it creates something beautiful_ like when you discover the skeletons summoned by the little necromancer girl can revive you when you're downed. Or when you're fighting a jellyfish god from another planet and your buddy in Skyrim armor screams as he rises into the sky on a giant rock_ saving you from a big attack. Or when you're low on healing flasks and praying for an easy boss and out from the dark portal steps a nightmare from an entirely different game_ one you thought you'd never have to face again. Sometimes Nightreign is so cruel all you can do is laugh as it shoves your nose in the dirt. But then it turns around and delivers catharsis. Everyone cheered in voice chat when Centipede Demon_ the boss nobody remembers from Dark Souls_ showed up to get obliterated by 14 years of action RPG combat advancement. When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played. I just wish it wasn't so hard to play—not because the bosses are tough_ but because of how indifferent it is to helping you experience everything that's so endearing about it. All the work is on you to find something that draws you back in_ to find a reason to try again. For me that's a new build or a new character to focus on with a game-changing Relic setup. For others it can be helping out a friend struggling with the brutal difficulty. And for something as experimental and as weird as Nightreign is_ that might be enough. Nightreign is light on story_ but it carries with it my favorite theme core to all of FromSoft's games: The irresistible nature to persevere against what feels like impossible odds. That I can spend three hours getting pummeled by a game as impenetrable as this and still feel the urge to give it another go has me annoyed that the same trick's working on me again. Nightreign may be kind of a mess_ but it's a mess made just for me.

325600490,Kyle Chrisley is happy his parents are coming home from prison.    On Tuesday_ May 27_ shortly after his younger sister Savannah Chrisley_ 27_ announced that dad Todd Chrisley and step-mom Julie Chrisley received a pardon from President Donald Trump_ the 33-year-old shared his reaction.    "I'm ecstatic_" Kyle told E! News. "Truly. I just found out a little bit ago and I still just can't believe it."   His biological mother is Todd’s ex-wife_ Teresa Terry.   "I know Savannah had been working at this for so long and she never gave up_" he continued. "So I'm just grateful to her and to President Trump for making this happen for my dad and Julie."   Todd_ 56_ and Julie_ 52_ were indicted in August 2019 and later sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison after being convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The couple had been appealing their case ever since.   Kyle_ who only appeared on the first season of Chrisley Knows Best as he became estranged from his father_ told E! News he is hopeful for the future.   "I know they can't wait to get home and just be with family_ and I'm going to remain hopeful that another reconciliation is possible_" Kyle told the outlet.   During a July 2024 episode of her Unlocked podcast_ Savannah explained why their father chose not to speak with Kyle.   “My dad has every reason not to speak to Kyle_” she said. “Just because it’s your child doesn’t mean that you have to accept abuse. It doesn't mean you have to accept manipulation and hate and all these things.”   After saying she and her father had the “strongest relationship_” she spoke out against her sibling.   “People will do anything for a little bit of fame or attention_” Savannah claimed_ saying Kyle provides statements about their father on social media and to the press. “What I don't process well is having Kyle play the victim to life circumstances he's created. What I don't do well with someone who has abused people his entire life now trying to play victim_ trying to get people to feel bad for him.”   She continued_ “Yes_ my father has not spoken to him and that is because now_ we are all at a place where we don't have to be abused any further. We are allowed to create boundaries for ourselves.”   On Tuesday_ Savannah said Trump called her personally to let her know he would be pardoning her parents.    Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Thank you Mr President for bringing my family back_" he wrote on his Instagram Story over a photo of Trump sitting in the Oval Office.

325813908,Hamas’s chief in Gaza_ Mohammed Sinwar_ has been killed_ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on May 28.  Speaking before the Knesset_ Israel’s Parliament_ Netanyahu said that the Jewish state has “eliminated Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif_ Yahya Sinwar_ and Mohammed Sinwar.”  Haniyeh was Hamas’s political leader when he was taken out by Israel in Tehran in July 2024. Deif was the head of Hamas’s military wing when he was killed by Israel in Gaza that same month. Yahya Sinwar_ who was the leader of Hamas_ was the mastermind behind Hamas’s Oct. 7_ 2023_ terrorist attack on Israel. He was killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza in October 2024. He was succeeded by his brother_ Mohammed.  Mohammed Sinwar_ 49_ was taken out by an Israeli strike in the Gaza city of Khan Younis_ where he once commanded the town’s brigade.  “In the last two days_ we’ve been executing a dramatic plan toward the complete defeat of Hamas_” Netanyahu said. “We’re taking control of their food distribution and money machine. This is what destroys their governing capabilities. That’s what we promised.”  Mohammed Sinwar’s history of terrorism includes being involved in the Hamas group that captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006_ who was held for five years before being released as part of an exchange that resulted in the release of more than 1_000 Palestinian terrorist prisoners. In the previous decade_ he spent nine months behind bars in Ramallah before escaping in 2000.

325587004,Elon Musk says he is "disappointed" by the price tag on the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House last week and heavily backed by President Trump_ the billionaire who recently stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency_ or DOGE_ told "CBS Sunday Morning" in an exclusive broadcast interview."I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk said.Musk's comments appear to put him at odds with Mr. Trump_ who has championed the massive spending package. The legislation — which still needs to pass the Senate — would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts_ boost border security spending_ impose work requirements on Medicaid and roll back clean energy tax credits.The tax provisions of the package_ titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" after Mr. Trump's name for the bill_ would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034_ according to the Congressional Budget Office."I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_" Musk told CBS News_ "but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion."Musk was a near-constant presence in the early months of the Trump administration_ with his DOGE staffers sweeping through virtually every government agency to make widespread cuts — drawing concern from Democrats and even some Trump allies_ as well as numerous legal challenges. Musk_ who is also the CEO of Tesla_ SpaceX and the social media platform X_ has said he will dial back his involvement in government.See more of the interview with Elon Musk on "CBS Sunday Morning" on June 1.

325577048,It’s clear that Terry Bradshaw isn’t about to suggest Aaron Rodgers should wear the number 12 jersey for the Steelers. It’s even more obvious that Rodgers wouldn’t agree to it.  Bradshaw was blunt_ as he often is_ regarding the Steelers’ decision to wait indefinitely on Rodgers.  “That’s ridiculous_” Bradshaw remarked on 103.7 The Buzz in Little Rock_ Arkansas (as reported by CBSSports.com). “I find that notion laughable. What_ bring him in for just a single season? Are you serious? . . . . He should remain in California. Head out there_ munch on some tree bark_ and have conversations with the spirits.”  Bradshaw believes the Steelers should have given 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett more of a chance.  “I was a fan of Kenny Pickett_” Bradshaw mentioned. “I appreciated his play at Pitt. I know him and understand his character. When Pittsburgh got him_ here’s what they failed to do: They didn’t offer him protection…they didn’t provide a solid offensive line. They were focused on running the ball without a line capable of proper defense_ and they also lacked weapons. He virtually had no notable wide receivers.”  “And then they throw a kid in there for two years and you’ve got an offense that doesn’t fit and doesn’t work_ and they can’t run because their offensive line’s not even good enough for a run blocking team. And therefore they say Pickett was a failure. He wasn’t a failure_ the Steelers were a failure.”  The Steelers are willing to give Rodgers as much time as he wants because they believe_ with Rodgers at quarterback_ they won’t fail in 2025.   It all depends on what counts as success. Making the playoffs? Winning a playoff game? Getting to the conference championship?  Rodgers simply needs a season strong enough to cause his 2024 experience with the Jets to be viewed as an aberration. The Steelers and their fans could be aiming a lot higher than that.
325708928,May 28 (UPI) -- The Czech Republic accused China on Wednesday of being responsible for a "malicious cyber campaign" that targeted an unclassified network of the foreign ministry.  Little information about the cyberattack was made public_ the Czech government said it began in 2022_ affected an institution designated as Czech critical infrastructure and that it was perpetrated by well-known China-backed hackers APT31.  "The Government of the Czech Republic strongly condemns this malicious cyber campaign against its critical infrastructure_" the Czech foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.  "Such behavior undermines the credibility of the People's Republic of China and contradicts its public declarations."  APT31_ which stands for Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31_ is a collection of China state-sponsored intelligence officers_ contract hackers and support staff that conduct cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government.  Seven Chinese nationals were charged in the United States in late March for their involvement in APT31_ which federal prosecutors said has targeted U.S. and foreign critics of the Chinese government_ business_ and political officials over the last 14 years.  The Czech government said Wednesday it tied APT31 to the cyberattack through an "extensive investigation_" which "led to a high degree of certainty about the responsible actor."  "The Government of the Czech Republic has identified the People's Republic of China as being responsible_" it said.  NATO and the European Union -- both of which Czech is a member of -- were quick to condemn China following Prague's revelation.  "We stand in solidarity with the Czech Republic following the malicious cyber campaign against its Ministry of Foreign Affairs_" the security alliance said in a statement.  NATO did not blame China but acknowledged the Czechs' accusation of Beijing for the attack and said that it has observed "with increasing concern the growing pattern of malicious cyber activities stemming from the People's Republic of China."  Similarly_ the EU did not directly point the finger at China for the attack on the Czech Republic_ but said there have been cyberattacks linked to Beijing targeting EU and its member stats.  "In 2021_ we urged Chinese authorities to take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from their territories. Since then_ several Member States have attributed similar activities at their national level_" the EU's high representative_ Kaja Kallas_ said in a statement.  "We have repeatedly raised our concerns during bilateral engagements and we will continue to do so in the future."

325964330,While FromSoftware released a fairly impressive-looking launch trailer for Elden Ring Nightreign_ it has another that may resonate with fans on a deeper level. It showcases more gameplay with the Revenant_ the eighth and final Nightfarer to be revealed_ set to the tune of “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence. Yes_ seriously. Check it out below.  One of the Revenant’s abilities involves raising her downed allies_ which could very well be her Ultimate Art (and is the entire reason for the song).

325944054,Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday evening that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students_ including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields.”  He added that the State Department was revising visa criteria to “enhance scrutiny” of all future applications from China_ including Hong Kong.  The move is certain to send ripples of anxiety across university campuses in the United States and spur recriminations in China. China is the country of origin for the second-largest group of international students in the United States_ and many universities rely on Chinese and other international students paying full tuition for a substantial part of their annual revenue.  American universities have also benefited over many decades by drawing some of the most talented students from China and other countries. Chinese students and researchers are represented in large numbers in university science laboratories.
326084092,The dollar_ which has been under pressure since Mr. Trump started a trade war with U.S. trading partners_ rose on Wednesday. Oil prices_ which have dipped on fears that a slowdown in trade would hamper economic growth_ also jumped. The price of gold_ which has set a series of record highs as investors flocked to the traditional haven in times of turmoil_ slipped.  Investors sold U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 30-year Treasury note_ a focus for investors after Mr. Trump’s bill to cut taxes deepened worries about debt and deficits_ rose back above 5 percent. A significant reduction or cancellation of a chunk of U.S. tariffs “would be bad news for Treasuries since it would reduce a significant source of income and widen the budget deficit over the coming decade_” analysts at Panmure Liberum wrote in a note.  They added that the court ruling suggests that in the long run_ “extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely to happen going forward_ which reduces uncertainty somewhat.” But in the short term_ they said_ the ruling and subsequent challenges to it “will add significant uncertainty to the mix_ making it even harder for U.S. businesses to plan.”  That suggests markets could continue to veer up and down on tariff developments_ as investors now parse court rulings and appeals in addition to Mr. Trump’s threats_ delays and concessions.

325955376,May 28 (UPI) -- Elon Musk_ who personally spent $277 million to bring Donald Trump back to the White House_ said Wednesday night he is leaving the Trump administration after working to slash the size of the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency.  Musk_ the world's richest man with a net worth of $421.2 billion_ according to Forbes_ can work for 130 days in a calendar year as a special employee. His full-time tenure would end on Friday after joining Trump in the White House for the Jan. 20 inauguration.  Musk posted to X_ the social media platform he owns: "As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end_ I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government."  Musk told reporters earlier this week that he plans to focus more on his businesses: Tesla_ SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI_ which now includes X.  Musk said he will keep a small office in the White House as an unofficial adviser.  During a Tesla earnings call in April_ Musk said he would spend a "day or two per week" on government work until the end of Trump's term in January 2029.  There are around 100 DOGE employees_ including many embedded in agencies. Their status wasn't announced.  Musk told reporters last week that he had worked in Washington_ D.C._ on his DOGE initiative "seven days a week_ or close to seven days a week" during Trump's first 100 days in office. He frequently traveled on Air Force One with Trump to the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach_ Fla._ and recently to the Middle East.  This has meant less attention to his companies_ including publicly held Tesla_ the company that makes electric vehicles_ solar panels/shingles and energy storage devices.  "It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side_ and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks_" he said in an interview with Ars Technica.  Tesla released its first-quarter financial data on April 22.  Tesla's revenue was its lowest in three years: $19.3 billion total_ down 9% compared with the same time last year. The company's profit was $3.15 billion_ which is a 15% decline. And its earnings of 27 cents a share was a drop of 70% from 45 cents a year ago.  In the first quarter_ Tesla produced more than 362_000 vehicles.  On Wednesday_ pension fund leaders sent a letter to Tesla's board demanding that Musk must put in 40 hours per week_ at a minimum_ to attain any future CEO pay package.  Protests were mounted at dealerships nationwide as people opposed Musk's program and worker cuts.  He said his efforts have been far more challenging than expected and DOGE had become "the whipping boy for everything."  During an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday_ Musk said "something bad would happen anywhere_ and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it. People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That's really uncool."  Musk originally said he would slash $2 trillion in spending but now he says $175 billion in taxpayer money has been saved but experts say that number is greatly inflated.  He also became at odds with Trump on Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package going through Congress.  "I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill_ frankly_ which increases the budget deficit_ not just decreases it_ and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing_" Musk told CBS Sunday Morning. "I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful_ but I don't know if it can be both."  He spoke to reporters from SpaceX headquarters in Texas before Tuesday night's Starship test flight.  "People want to have the chill vibes_ and SpaceX is sort of ultra hardcore. But if we're not ultra hardcore_ how are we going to get to Mars? You're not going to get to Mars in 40 hours a week_" Musk told The Post.  Besides sending astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station_ SpaceX has launched 8_774 Starlink satellites from Florida and California since May 2019.  Starlink is used by several federal agencies_ including the State Department_ Coast Guard_ Interior Department and the Space Force. The Federal Aviation Administration is exploring whether to use Starlink to replace its aging telecommunications system.
325964290,By AARON BEARD AP Sports Writer  RALEIGH_ N.C. — Carter Verhaeghe broke a tie off a feed from Aleksander Barkov with 7:39 left and the defending champion Florida Panthers advanced to their third straight Stanley Cup Final_ beating the Carolina Hurricanes_ 5-3_ on Wednesday night in Game 5.  The Panthers beat the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference final for the second time in three seasons. The Panthers will face the winner of the Western final between Edmonton and Dallas_ with the Oilers leading 3-1 in that best-of-seven series to put them within a win of a rematch with Florida for the Cup.  Sam Bennett added an empty-net goal with 54 seconds left by skating down a loose puck straight out of the penalty box after Florida had held up against a critical late power play for the Hurricanes.  That capped a wild night that saw the Hurricanes jump to a 2-0 lead_ then Florida answer with three second-period goals_ only to see Carolina’s Seth Jarvis beat Sergei Bobrovsky midway through the third to tie it at 3.  When it was over_ the Panthers posed for pictures on Carolina’s home ice during the presentation of the Prince of Wales Trophy for the conference winner. Some Hurricanes fans remained defiant_ offering scattered “Let’s go_ Oilers!” chants.  The angst is appropriate considering how Florida has now twice ended Carolina’s push to its first Cup Final since winning the franchise’s lone title in 2006 when now-coach Rod Brind’Amour was captain.  Florida had won the first three games of this series but lost 3-0 at home Monday night as the Hurricanes averted a second straight sweep against Florida. But by the final horn Wednesday_ the Panthers had won all three games in Raleigh in the series_ pushed their road winning streak in these playoffs to five games and earned an eighth postseason road win overall.  Matthew Tkachuk_ Evan Rodrigues and Anton Lundell scored on consecutive shots during Florida’s second-period flurry_ while Bobrovsky finished with 20 saves.  Barkov’s assist on Verhaeghe’s winner also stood out as its own terrific individual effort. Florida’s captain was jostling with Carolina’s Dmitry Orlov in a battle near the boards on the left side when he turned toward the crease_ stepped inside of Eric Robinson and sent the puck over to Verhaeghe for the finish that silenced a Hurricanes home crowd in full-throated roar after Jarvis’ tying score.  Sebastian Aho scored twice in the first period for Carolina_ both on neutral-zone giveaways – the first being one from Gustav Forsling that hit Aho in stride for a a breakaway chance that ended up in the net. Aho added another off a giveaway from Niko Mikkola with little more than a minute left in the first for a 2-0 lead.  Carolina has won at least one postseason series in its current run of seven straight playoff appearances_ though three have now ended in the Eastern final.  More to come on this story.
325949166,Sean Duffy first made a name for himself in 1997 as a housemate on The Real World: Boston.  He shares nine children with The Real World: San Francisco alum Rachel Campos-Duffy_ whom he met competing on Road Rules: All Stars in 1998 and married the following year.  Duffy spent eight years as Ashland County District Attorney in his home state of Wisconsin before serving in Congress from 2011 to 2019. He resigned from office that August_ citing his yet-to-be-born ninth child's health issues.  "After she’s born_ whether it’s two to six months after life_ she’s going to need open-heart surgery_" he explained on Fox & Friends. "They gotta crack her open and fix the heart."  Duffy added_ "I love politics_ but I love my family_ and I think it’s always a balance. The schedules are grueling. I’m out in D.C. four days a week_ and then I’m back with Rachel." Traveling around his district meeting people_ he said_ "we get beat up a little bit as members of Congress. We’re a favorite punching bag."  On The Real World_ "I was forced to live with people who were so different than me_" he told NCTA in May 2019. "When I first got there_ I saw the stark differences I had with my roommates. But when I left_ I realized I had way more in common with them than I ever imagined."  He compared the experience to crossing the aisle in Congress: "It's amazing the kind of legislation you can work on together and how many points of agreement you actually have."
325938970,President Trump on Wednesday commuted the sentence of notorious former Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover_ who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover_ 74_ the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples_ was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for the 1973 murder of 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer William "Pooky" Young_ when he was convicted of federal charges in 1997_ and sentenced to six life terms. Hoover was among 39 Gangster Disciples leaders indicted in August 1995 in Operation Headache_ a six-year effort by the feds to infiltrate Gangster Disciples. Federal prosecutors had accused him of leading a criminal enterprise to continue overseeing the gang while in prison in Illinois. Hoover is currently serving six life sentences in a maximum security prison in Colorado_ according to federal prison records. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody_ but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois_ dating back to 1973 for Young's murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at ADX Florence_ a maximum security prison in Colorado that they described as "the most restrictive_ draconian supermax prison in the United States."In a statement_ Hoover's attorneys_ Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore_ said they are "thrilled" to see he will be released from federal custody. "The Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover's considerable growth and complete rehabilitation. Despite the Court's unwillingness to do the right thing_ Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters. Thankfully_ Mr. Hoover's pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover."When Hoover was up for parole by the State of Illinois in 2022_ his parole was denied. An Illinois Department of Corrections order says Hoover would have to be turned over to the state to serve the remainder of his state sentence if released from federal custody. In 1993_ Hoover spoke to former CBS News Chicago reporter John Davis. At the time_ Hoover was 42 years old and had already served 20 years in prison."I've done my time_" Hoover said in the 1993 interview. "I paid my debt to society."In the interview with Davis_ the leader of the Gangster Disciples and convicted murderer he'd had a lot of time to think about ways to stop the gang violence on the streets of Chicago."One teenager don't like the other teenager because of the way he wear his hat_ because his ideology is different from his; a Disciple don't like a Vice Lord_" Hoover said in the interview. "We're all Black people. There's no difference."At that time_ Hoover_ also known as King Larry_ admitted being part of a fragile gang truce in the city and organizing a protest over plans to close healthcare clinics in African American neighborhoods. Ron Safer_ the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial_ expressed disappointment in the news of Hoover's sentence being commuted. "I was disappointed_" Safer said. "I do not think that this is an appropriate end to the Larry Hoover story â at least the federal part of it."Safer said Hoover was perhaps the most notorious criminal the state of Illinois has ever known. "He was convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise that had approximately 30_000 members across 28 states_ selling over $100 million worth of drugs in the state of Illinois alone each year_" said Safer_ "and he ran that entire operation with ruthless efficiency from prison_ where he was serving a state sentence for double murder."Safer also emphasized that about Hoover had been recorded saying teenagers needed to sell drugs for his criminal organization. The recording was made a year after the Gangster Disciples leader was interviewed on CBS Chicago."There was another tape where Larry Hoover said_ 'You have to share your drugs with these children â and I'm talking about 12 years old_ 13 years old_ 14 years old â so that they can sell it_ and they can have something'_" Safter said_ "and he said_ 'Make them know that with you_ they are somebody_ and without you_ they are nobody.'"Again_ Safer said those comments were made by Hoover after the Gangster Disciples said he was redeemed_ and said he understood that all of the violence in the city should be stopped.

327172888,The authorities said they were investigating an attack in Boulder_ Colo._ on Sunday as an act of terrorism_ after a man used a “makeshift flamethrower” to attack demonstrators honoring Israeli hostages in Gaza.  Six people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries_ and two of them were in serious condition_ officials said.  Witnesses said the man threw an incendiary device into the crowd in a downtown pedestrian mall_ according to the authorities. The suspect_ identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs_ yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack_ the witnesses said. Mr. Soliman_ 45_ had not been charged as of late Sunday night.  The attack may intensify deep unease in the Jewish community in the United States. In recent months_ two Israeli embassy aides were murdered in Washington_ and a man set fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania_ who is Jewish.
327326166,By LINDSAY WHITEHURST_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — A split Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a challenge to a state ban on assault weapons_ semiautomatic rifles that are popular among gun owners and that have also been used in multiple mass shootings.  The majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the case_ as is typical. But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement_ and a fourth said he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional.  Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken the case_ and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.  “I would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America_” Thomas wrote. “That question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR–15 owners throughout the country.”  Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now_ but he said that he is skeptical that such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue “in the next term or two.”  The Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15_ one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.  Several states have similar measures_ and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15.  The case comes three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country.  Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws_ covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004.

327393126,The man accused of injuring eight people Sunday on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall with a “makeshift flamethrower” and Molotov cocktails researched and planned the attack for more than a year_ according to federal court documents.  Mohamed Sabry Soliman_ a 45-year-old man whom federal officials said was living in Colorado illegally at the time of the attack_ has been charged with a federal hate crime_ according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest affidavit.  Soliman threw two lit Molotov cocktails at the crowd of Run for Their Lives demonstrators_ burning eight people_ the affidavit stated. Investigators found another box with at least 14 unlit Molotov cocktails inside nearby.  Run for Their Lives is a national movement calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The local Boulder chapter was hosting their weekly walk on Pearl Street when they were attacked by Soliman outside of the courthouse.  The walk was scheduled for 1 p.m. Soliman told federal officials he arrived at 12:55 p.m. and waited for them to arrive.  “No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin_ and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice_” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”  The Molotov cocktails were made with bottles and jars_ contained clear liquid and had red rags hanging out_ according to the document. A backpack weed sprayer was also discovered near the box of explosives.  Federal officials said the jars and weed sprayer were all filled with gasoline.  Soliman told investigators that he planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives chapter_ which he called a “Zionist group_” federal officials said.  Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again_ according to the FBI arrest affidavit.

327230032,Nationalist Karol Nawrocki_ backed by U.S. President Donald Trump_ clinched the Polish presidency in a tight run-off race that spells trouble for the country's current pro-EU government.  A final count showed Nawrocki_ who stood for the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost its majority in 2023_ secured 50.89% of votes against the 49.11% of rival Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Early results released before polls closed had put the liberal in the lead.  Nawrocki will succeed fellow conservative Andrzej Duda — who himself won the leadership with a razor-thin advantage against Trzaskowski in 2020 — for a five-year term and can then stand for re-election once.   The Polish election was closely watched in Europe_ the United States and battling Eastern European neighbors Russia and Ukraine as it raises questions over the solidity of Warsaw's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv.  The head of state's role in Poland is overshadowed by that of parliament_ but the president retains a critical veto over legislation. Duda has exercised this to block several reforms spearheaded by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition.  Eurosceptic Nawrocki can likewise deliver considerable setbacks to former European Council President Tusk's pro-EU government_ which repaired fractured relations with Brussels and last year unlocked payments of up to 137 billion euros ($156 billion) of EU funds that had been frozen over rule-of-law concerns.  The country of 37 million and the EU's sixth-largest economy was the largest net beneficiary of EU funds in 2024.  "I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland. We are all stronger together in our community of peace_ democracy_ and values_" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Monday on the X social media platform. "So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home."   A previously staunch supporter of Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion to date_ Poland has offered extensive security and logistical aid to Kyiv and earlier in January assumed the rotating one-year EU presidency from the Kremlin's chief European ally Hungary under the motto "Security_ Europe!"  Nawrocki has taken a more critical stance toward Kyiv during his campaign_ citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's alleged poor treatment of Poland. He also ruled out the embattled country's long-held ambition of adhering to NATO — a move feared to pit the military coalition against Russian hostilities.
327235828,Chinese authorities on Monday accused the U.S. of violating a recent trade pact that both agreed to in Geneva last month_ as they dismissed President Donald Trump’s allegation about Beijing breaching the agreement_ a move that could signal a further escalation in trade tensions between the two countries_ which could potentially jeopardize last month’s tariff truce.  China's Commerce Ministry accused the U.S. of violating a trade deal agreed in Geneva by imposing ... More additional chip restrictions and canceling Chinese student visas. AFP via Getty Images  In a press briefing_ a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson dismissed Trump’s comments accusing China of violating the agreement_ saying Beijing has worked “to strictly implement and actively safeguard the Geneva deal.”  The spokesperson noted that China had acted in accordance with the deal to cancel or suspend “relevant tariffs and non-tariff measures” it had taken as retaliation against the U.S. government’s reciprocal tariffs.  The spokesperson then accused the U.S. of introducing “ a number of discriminatory restrictive measures against China” after the talks_ citing expanded export controls on AI chips and other chip-building technology.  The official also criticized the U.S. government’s crackdown on Chinese student visas_ saying these actions violated the consensus reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on January 17.  The spokesperson then warned that if the U.S. continues to take actions that damage China_ Beijing will “take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”  What Had Trump Said About China Violating The Geneva Deal?  In a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday_ Trump said: “China_ perhaps not surprisingly to some_ HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US_” without specifying how it had done so. The president then signalled that the U.S. may retaliate against this alleged non-compliance_ saying: “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” In his post_ the president claimed his tariffs had put China in “grave economic danger” and he made a “FAST DEAL” in Geneva_ “in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation.”  What Do We Know About The Current State Of U.s.-China Trade Talks?  In an interview with Fox News last week_ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that trade talks with China were “a bit stalled_” but said he believes U.S. officials will be “having more talks with them in the next few weeks.” Bessent did not specify any sticking points that have prevented the talks from progressing_ but noted that he believes a direct call between Trump and Xi will be needed to close the deal. “I think that given the magnitude of the talks_ given the complexity_ that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other_” the treasury secretary said. Bessent then added that Trump and Xi have a “very good relationship” and he was “confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known.”  Key Background  U.S. and Chinese officials met in Geneva last month to discuss a resolution to a spiraling trade war between the two countries_ triggered by President Donald Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs.” After the meeting both sides announced they had agreed to significantly cut back tariffs placed on each other’s goods for at least 90 days_ while continuing discussions on a broader trade deal. As part of the agreement_ both sides agreed to lower their “reciprocal tariffs” on each other from 125% to 10%. However_ a separate 20% tariff on Chinese goods imposed by Trump earlier this year—over China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis in the U.S.—would remain in effect_ keeping the overall tariffs on Chinese goods at 30%. The talks came after both sides engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war which saw U.S. levies on China hit 145% while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were raised to 125%. While announcing the deal_ Bessent acknowledged that the spiraling tariffs were equivalent to a trade embargo and said “neither side wants that.”  What To Watch For  No meetings have taken place between the two sides since the Geneva talks. In their joint statement_ both sides had agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations.” Bessent and Greer will represent the U.S. side in these discussions_ while Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side. These future talks were set to be held alternately in China and the U.S. or in a third country that both sides agree upon. It is unclear how these proposed meetings will be handled amid the latest round of tensions. After the Geneva deal announcement_ Trump also said he was looking forward to talk with Xi_ but that also hasn’t happened so far.

327173224,WARSAW_ Poland — Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election_ according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski_ who received 49.11%.  The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday_ revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.  An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later.  The outcome indicates that Poland can be expected to take a more nationalist path under its new leader_ who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.  The role of a president in Poland  Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However_ the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and to veto legislation.  Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda_ a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.  A headache for Tusk  Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 at the end of a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide — so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises_ such as loosening the restrictive abortion law.  But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.  Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises_ which he had made both to voters and to the EU.  A former boxer_ historian and political novice  Nawrocki_ a 42-year-old historian_ was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.  The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023_ when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback_ and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.  Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance_ which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland_ and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list_ according to Polish media reports.  Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional_ patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends_ including LGBTQ+ visibility_ have embraced him_ viewing him as a reflection of the traditional values they grew up with.  The Trump factor  Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.  The conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland last week to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem_ the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally_ strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.  The U.S. has about 10_000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.  A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore "normality_" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies_ and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.
327140658,Two Oregon high school athletes refused to share the podium with a transgender competitor at the state’s track and field championships_ footage shows.  The female students — Tigard High School’s Alexa Anderson and Sherwood High School’s Reese Eckard — stepped down from the high jump podium as the winners of the competition were being announced across the Eugene stadium Saturday night.  Anderson and Eckard had finished in third and fourth place_ while Ida B. Wells High School’s trans student Lia Rose tied for fifth.  Rose had competed in boys’ track and field divisions as recently as 2024 and 2023_ according to Fox News.  Crowds were cheering for the athletes throughout the ceremony_ and it remains unclear how the audience reacted to the protest.  A race official showed up shortly after Anderson and Eckard stepped down and ushered them away as they stood with their backs to the podium.  It remains unclear if their standing at the competition was affected by the move.  But the incident quickly gained attention online_ especially after women’s sports advocate Riley Gaines — who is staunchly opposed to transgender athletes competing in women’s sports — posted footage from it on X.  “Watch this. Two female athletes in Oregon refused to stand on the podium because a boy was awarded a place_” Gaines wrote.   “Girls have had enough_” she added.  The video was also picked up by other accounts — including “Libs of TikTok” — which praised the athletes’ act of defiance.  It was just the latest incident where women’s athletes have protested against transgender competitors in their division.   In April_ women’s fencer Stephanie Turner took a knee rather than competing with a trans person during a Maryland match_ and was put on a year-long probation by USA Fencing for the move.  And in May_ 16-year-old high schooler Reese Hogan finished second to a trans athlete in California’s CIF Southern Section Finals triple jump competition — but stepped up to the first place spot on the podium after her competitor stepped down.
327320366,By SAM McNEIL_ Associated Press  BARCELONA_ Spain (AP) — The European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration’s surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.  EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal_ but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side_” European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.  “In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome_ the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures_ including in response to this latest tariff increase_” Gill said.  He said the EU is finalizing an “expanded list of countermeasures” that would “automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier.” That’s the date when a 90-day pause_ intended to ease negotiations_ ends in tariffs announced by the two economic powerhouses on each other. About halfway through that grace period_ Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.  Trump’s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs_ with levies threatened_ added and_ often_ taken away. Top officials at the EU’s executive commission says they’re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods. Negotiations will next continue on Wednesday in Paris in a meeting between the EU’s top trade negotiator_ Maroš Šefčovič_ and his counterpart_ U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.  The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S._ as well as lower duties on cars_ but it isn’t likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — or open up the EU to American beef.  The EU has offered the U.S. a “zero for zero” outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides for industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that but EU officials have said it’s still on the table.  The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are also so ubiquitous in packaging that they’re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.
327343944,Washington â The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term_ which begins in October_ with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time_ place and manner of federal elections.If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue_ their lawsuit could proceed. The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted. Bost_ who was first elected to Congress in 2014_ and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes_ infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments_ and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023_ finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue_ a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year_ agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court_ arguing that in recent years_ the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts."The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations_" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court_ adding that it is "vitally important" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court."It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time_ place_ and manner regulations affecting their elections_" the Republicans wrote. "Aside from the interests of the litigants_ it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly_ not arbitrary_ fashion."But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal_ arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day_ but arrive after."They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future_" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. "Rather_ petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates_ on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time_ place_ and manner of conducting an election."

327858142,Jessie J is providing an update on her health.  The "Bang Bang" singer shared that she was diagnosed with breast cancer over two months ago and has been "in and out of tests" this year.   "I was diagnosed with early breast cancer_" Jessie said in an Instagram video June 3. "Cancer sucks in any form_ but I'm holding on to the word 'early.'"  The 37-year-old said she will undergo surgery after performing at the Summertime Ball 2025 concert in London on June 15.   "It's a very dramatic way to get a boob job_" she explained. "I am going to disappear for a bit after Summertime Ball to have my surgery_ and I will come back with massive tits and more music."  While Jessie—who shares son Sky_ 2_ with basketball player Chanan Safir Colman—noted that she hesitated to announce her diagnosis publicly_ she decided to be "open" for multiple reasons.  "One_ because_ selfishly_ I do not talk about it enough_" she continued. "I'm not processing it because I'm working so hard. I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I'm an open book."

328071010,NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI has made an arrest in New York in connection with an explosion of a Palm Springs_ California fertility clinic_ three law enforcement officials familiar with the matter said Wednesday.  Federal prosecutors are expected to release details about the case at a news conference in Los Angeles.  The arrest_ which was first reported by NBC News_ took place at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Tuesday evening_ according to the officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a criminal case that has not been publicly disclosed.  The arrest stems from an apparent car bomb detonation of a fertility clinic last month by a man who authorities said had nihilistic writings. The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect and said he was believed to have died in the explosion. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.  Officials said at the time that they were investigating whether Bartkus had any help.  The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palms Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene_ with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street.  A senior FBI official called the explosion possibly the “largest bombing scene that we’ve had in Southern California.”  Bartku attempted to livestream the explosion and left behind writings that communicated “nihilistic ideations” that were still being examined to determine his state of mind_ the FBI said. U.S. Attorney Bilal “Bill” Essayli_ the top federal prosecutor in the area_ called the message “anti-pro-life.”
328005216,For the leaders of U.S. Jewish institutions_ the recent attacks in Boulder_ Colorado_ and Washington_ D.C._ are stark reminders of their responsibility to remain vigilant despite years of hardening their security measures and trying to keep their people safe.  Now_ they’re sounding the alarm for more help after a dozen people were injured in Boulder while demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza on Sunday. And just over a week earlier_ two Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot outside a Jewish museum in Washington.   After that shooting_ 43 Jewish organizations issued a joint statement requesting more support from the U.S. government for enhanced security measures. Specifically_ they asked Congress to increase funding to the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to $1 billion.  “Every Jewish organization has been serious about security for years. We have to be_” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs_ president of the Union for Reform Judaism. “The grants are to harden the buildings_ for things like cameras and glass_ and some kind of blockage so they can’t drive a truck into the building.”  “These are the everyday realities of Jewish life in the 21st century in America. It’s a sad reality_ but it is an essential responsibility of leadership to make sure that people are first and foremost safe.”  Shira Hutt_ executive vice president at The Jewish Federations of North America_ said existing federal funds were inadequate_ with only 43% of last year’s applicants to the grant program receiving funding.  Citing the attack in Boulder_ she said increased funding for local law enforcement is also crucial.  “Thankfully_ the attack was stopped before even further damage could have been done_” she said. “This is really now a full-blown crisis_ and we need to make sure that we have all the support necessary.”  One of the Jewish Federation’s state-based affiliates_ JEWISHcolorado_ on Tuesday launched an emergency fund to raise $160_000 in support of the Boulder community. Its goals include enhancing safety and security measures for Jewish institutions and events.  Strengthening alliances and pushing for results  Leaders of Jewish Federation Los Angeles urged government_ business and philanthropic groups to “supercharge an alliance so we can build mutual understanding_ dispel conspiracy theories_ and provide rapid response when any group is under threat.”  “Jews here in Los Angeles are terrified but determined_” said the federation’s president_ Rabbi Noah Farkas. “We do not need more community meetings_ we need results and we are counting on our local government and our law enforcement partners to do more.”  The security costs at 63 Jewish day schools have risen on average 84% since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct_ 7_ 2023_ according to the Teach Coalition_ the education advocacy arm of the Orthodox Union_ an umbrella group for Orthodox Judaism.  The coalition is advocating for more state and federal security funding for Jewish schools and camps_ as well as synagogues.   The attacks in Washington and Boulder only heighten the urgency_ said its national director Sydney Altfield.  “Some people see this as an isolated instance_ whether it is in Colorado_ whether it’s in D.C._” she said. “But we have to step up and realize that it could happen anywhere. … It is so important that our most vulnerable_ our children_ are secure to the highest extent.”  In Florida_ Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of Congregation Beth Am said members of the Reform synagogue in the Tampa Bay area “are feeling very nervous right now and having some additional security might make people a little bit more comfortable.”  He said that “there’s a definite sense that these attacks are not isolated events_ that these attacks are_ in part_ the result of a lot of the antisemitic rhetoric that we’ve been hearing in society for years now.”  However_ he said part of his message as a faith leader in such a climate has been to encourage resilience.  “We can’t let this define us. … We can’t stop doing what we do; we can’t stop coming to synagogue; we can’t stop having our activities_” he said. “Our job is to add holiness to our lives and to the world_ and we can’t let this stop us from focusing on sacred work.”  Security concerns inside and outside  Jacobs_ the Reform Judaism leader_ said the latest attacks in Washington and Boulder signaled that new security strategies were needed.  “Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were murdered outside of the event at the D.C. Jewish Museum_” he said.  “And that presented a whole additional sort of challenges for law enforcement and for each of our institutions doing security_ which is: you can’t just worry about who comes in; you actually have to worry about who’s lurking outside_ and so_ that is part now of our protocols.”  The attack in Boulder_ he said_ took place during a “peaceful protest” where demonstrators were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.  “We have to worry about what happens inside our institutions. … We also have to be thinking and working with law enforcement about what happens outside.”  Jacobs recalled that when a Christian leader recently visited a Reform synagogue_ he was “stunned by the security protocols_” which included procedures that Jacobs likened to passengers passing through airport security.  “I said_ ‘Well_ what do you do in your churches?’ and he said_ ‘Well_ we like to be welcoming.’ And I said: ‘We don’t have that luxury. We want to make sure our people feel safe_ otherwise people will stop coming.’”  Associated Press reporter Tiffany Stanley contributed to this report.

327840856,By Juan A. Lozano | Associated Press  HOUSTON — What prompted the fatal shooting of Jonathan Joss_ a Native American voice actor best known for his work on the animated television series “King of the Hill_” remained unclear Tuesday.  While Joss’ husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled “violent homophobic slurs” before opening fire_ San Antonio police have said they’ve found “no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss’ murder was related to his sexual orientation.” Police did not respond to multiple emails on Tuesday seeking additional information on the cause of the shooting.  Since Joss’ killing_ friends_ actors Joss worked with and fans have honored the actor’s memory with tributes and fond remembrances.  Here’s what to know about Joss_ his career and his shooting:  Who was Joss?  Joss_ 59_ grew up in San Antonio and graduated from the communications and theater program at Our Lady of the Lake University in 1990.  Joss was best known as the voice of John Redcorn_ a Native American character on the popular “King of the Hill” animated series_ which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show_ which Joss had already worked on_ is set to start in August.  Joss also had a recurring role on the television show “Parks and Recreation_” playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series “Tulsa King” in 2022.  What was happening with Joss in the months before his death?  Joss’ childhood home_ where he still lived_ burned down in January. He lost all his belongings and his three dogs were killed in the blaze. A GoFundMe account had been set up to help Joss and his husband_ Tristan Kern de Gonzales_ get back on their feet.  “We may have lost our home_ but not our hope. We’re moving forward with love_ humor_ and a little elbow grease…and we’re incredibly grateful for every ounce of support_” Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.  By the end of May_ Joss was back in Texas_ and on Saturday_ he took part in a live music performance in Austin_ located about 80 miles northeast of San Antonio.  Who is accused of fatally shooting Joss?  Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez_ 56_ is accused by police of confronting Joss and his husband as they were checking their mail at the burned-down home Sunday night.  In a statement_ de Gonzales alleged that when Ceja Alvarez opened fire_ Joss pushed his husband out of the way and saved his life.  Ceja Alvarez was charged with murder. Court records indicate he was freed Monday on a $200_000 bond.  Ceja Alvarez’s attorney_ Alfonso Otero_ did not immediately return a call or an email seeking comment.  Robert Rios_ a friend of Joss’_ told TV station KSAT that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.  How is Joss being remembered by friends_ actors?  Actor Chris Pratt_ who worked with Joss on “Parks and Recreation_” fondly remembered the actor in an Instagram story on Monday. Both actors had also appeared in the 2016 remake of “The Magnificent Seven.”  “Damn. RIP Jonathan. Always such a kind dude_” Pratt wrote. “Sad to see. Prayers up. Hug your loved ones.”  In a Facebook post_ San Antonio-based Our Lady of the Lake University_ Joss’ alma mater_ called him “a trailblazer in his field. His work and advocacy have left a lasting impact_ and his legacy will continue to inspire.”  “You were more than a character — you were a storyteller_ a dreamer_ and a force that will never be forgotten_” comedian Roy Alex Gomez_ who was a friend of Joss_ wrote in a Facebook post.
328023062,Iran’s supreme leader on Wednesday blasted the US as “arrogant” as he effectively rejected a revised nuclear deal that would allow Tehran to continue low-level uranium enrichment after it is signed.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei argued that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100%” against the country’s interests and “can do spirit” — as he ripped a central US demand amid talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.  “The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100% against our interests… The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear program. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?” he said in a televised speech.  Khamenei’s remarks come just days after the US presented Iran with the proposal for a new nuclear deal.  The proposal outline_ first reported Monday by Axios_ was submitted Saturday by White House special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.  If agreed_ it would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium domestically_ but only for civilian use.   Tehran will also have to temporarily reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% — well below weapons-grade levels of 90%.  After five rounds of talks_ several hard-to-bridge issues still remain — including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil.  Khamenei_ who has the final say on all matters of state_ stopped short of saying the talks should be halted.  He did_ however_ say that the latest proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’.”  “Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear program and the enemies have focused on the enrichment_” Khamenei said.

327837128,The supply chain warfare_ which comes on top of tariffs the two countries have inflicted on the other’s imports_ has alarmed companies that say they cannot make their products without components sourced from both. And it has made officials in Washington increasingly nervous about other choke points where China could squeeze the United States_ including pharmaceuticals or shipping.  In recent weeks_ the airplane industry has emerged as both a weapon_ and a victim_ in this fight.  The jet engine technology that powers airplanes_ and the navigation systems that control them_ largely come from the United States_ developed by companies like General Electric. In China’s quest to build a viable competitor to Boeing_ for example_ it has had to source engine technology from GE Aerospace.  But a jet engine also cannot be made without China. Minerals that are processed there are essential for special coatings and components that help the engine operate smoothly at high temperatures_ as well as other uses.  Beijing restricted exports of those minerals_ known as rare earths_ in April after President Trump began imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports.  The move has threatened to shutter what is left of advanced manufacturing in the United States — including the work done by many defense contractors. In May_ Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets it needed to build cars.  The United States responded with its own tech restrictions. Last week_ U.S. officials suspended some licenses that allowed American companies to ship airplane technology to China_ as well as others related to biotechnology and semiconductors_ people familiar with the move say.  At the same time_ officials in the Department of Defense_ the Department of the Interior and the National Security Council are accelerating efforts to find more domestic supplies of rare earths_ including considering U.S. government funding for new mines and processing facilities_ people familiar with the matter said.  But any such efforts could take years to come to fruition. On average_ it has taken the United States 29 years to develop a single mine_ according to statistics from S&P.  The Trump administration is also weighing further actions. It has been considering including major Chinese chipmakers_ as well as units of Chinese technology giants like Alibaba_ Tencent and Baidu_ on a so-called entity list that prohibits them from engaging in trade with the United States_ people familiar with the discussions said.  The supply chain battle has been years in the making. And both countries have been trying to guard against the other’s control of strategic goods by diversifying their own sources of supply.  After Mr. Trump levied tariffs on China during his first term_ many American companies established factories in countries outside of China_ including Vietnam and Mexico. Xi Jinping_ China’s leader_ set out to make his country less reliant on foreign sources of energy and technology by pumping huge investments into factories making semiconductors_ solar panels and electric vehicles.  Even so_ the economies remain deeply integrated_ an intractable reality as hundreds of billions of dollars in trade flow across the Pacific each year. While both countries are resolved to reduce their dependencies on the other for national security reasons_ doing so will be expensive and painful.  Since 2022_ for example_ the United States has been steadily expanding a global system to regulate advanced semiconductors and stop the technology from flowing to China. The rules have been aimed at restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence and advanced computing needed to augment its military. But they have been met with fierce resistance from an industry that sees China as an important source of revenue.  The United States has extended these export controls around the world_ even forbidding companies in other countries from selling products to China if they use American parts_ technology or software to manufacture them. While some foreign governments have bristled at these rules_ many have fallen in line.  This system rests on the idea that the United States should be the sole global power whose rules other countries need to abide by. But for China_ rare earth minerals are a way to challenge the American assertion of dominance.  Beijing set up a licensing system that allows it to monitor and approve sales of rare earths_ and magnets made from them_ to companies worldwide. When Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on China to 145 percent in April_ Beijing responded by targeting shipments of rare earths_ including pausing many of them.  In May_ American and Chinese officials arranged a meeting in Geneva to try to defuse their trade tensions. The Trump administration had several reasons to try to strike a truce. Companies had been warning of the risk of empty store shelves later this year because of plummeting imports from China_ and stock and bond markets were flashing warning signs. But it was China’s rare earth restrictions that appeared to put the most pressure on the United States to reach a resolution.  Negotiators agreed in Geneva to lower tariffs. As part of the deal_ China said it would “suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April_” according to a joint statement.  U.S. officials say Chinese shipments have yet to return to their previous levels. During an appearance on CNBC on Friday_ Jamieson Greer_ the United States Trade Representative_ said that the Chinese were “slow-rolling their compliance” and that American officials “haven’t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they’re supposed to be doing.”  Mr. Trump was more blunt. In a post on Truth Social on Friday_ he wrote that China had “TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US_” adding_ “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”  Lin Jian_ a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs_ denied the accusation in a briefing Tuesday_ saying that China had “earnestly implemented” the consensus reached in Geneva. Chinese officials say it is the United States that broke the deal_ including by issuing a notice saying that the use of chips made by Huawei_ the Chinese technology firm_ anywhere in the world violated U.S. law.  “The U.S._ without any factual basis_ has smeared and accused China_ imposed export controls on chips_ suspended sales of chip design software to China and announced the cancellation of Chinese student visas — extreme measures that severely undermine the Geneva Consensus and harm China’s legitimate rights and interests_” Mr. Lin said.  While some U.S. auto and electronics makers have recently received licenses from China for mineral shipments_ the uncertainty and continued backlog of requests for the products are continuing to make companies nervous. China had also appeared to be giving preference to European companies over American ones.  The tensions are spilling over into other aspects of the United States’ diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration has also proposed plans to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students_ including those with ties to the Communist Party.  So far_ it is unclear how the tensions can be defused. Karoline Leavitt_ the White House press secretary_ said Monday that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would likely speak in a call this week. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he had “no information to offer” on the call.  Daniel H. Rosen_ the co-founder of Rhodium Group_ a research company_ said that Beijing recognized years ago that rare earths would be central to advanced technologies and subsidized the build-out of those supplies. The United States_ he added_ “horribly underestimated” the demand for them.  China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths_ but it does the chemical processing for 90 percent of them. The country also makes more than 80 percent of the world’s batteries_ more than 70 percent of its electric cars_ and about half of the world’s steel_ iron and aluminum_ according to data from the International Energy Agency.  Securing an alternative supply would likely require the United States to invest hundreds of billions of dollars_ Mr. Rosen said_ and cooperation with global partners who were willing to work to set up supply chains outside of China.  “It’s going to be expensive_” he said. “We have a long way to go.”  While some shipments of minerals have restarted_ many U.S. industries remain anxious about shortages of supplies. Paul Triolo_ a partner at Albright Stonebridge Group_ said the Chinese licensing system was cumbersome and that there had been a notable drop in shipments of critical minerals since the start of April_ when Mr. Trump first issued astronomical tariffs on China.  Mr. Triolo said the United States had no choice except to negotiate with Beijing on the issue_ as well as set up a long-term strategy with other countries to reduce its dependence on China over the next five to seven years.  “This problem is deep and long lasting_” he said. “It will not go away_ or be easily solved.”  Chris Buckley_ Keith Bradsher and Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting and research.
277437292,Justin Baldoni filed a bombshell $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times after they published a story about his “It Ends With Us” co-star Blake Lively’s sexual harassment allegations.  According to Variety_ the actor filed the 87-page complaint in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday after the Times published the article “We Can Bury Anyone”: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine” on Dec. 21.   The filing lists his 10 plaintiffs_ including his publicists Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan_ who accused the outlet of “libel and false light invasion of privacy.”  “It Ends With Us” producers Steve Sarowitz and Jamey Heath allege the Times “cherry-picked and altered communications” without providing “necessary context.”  The lawsuit also accused the outlet of “promissory fraud and breach of implied-in-fact contract” with an argument against the claims written in their story about Lively_ per Variety.  “The Times story relied almost entirely on Lively’s unverified and self-serving narrative_ lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives_” the complaint alleges.   The lawsuit also points out that Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni on Dec. 21 rather than a lawsuit_ which the latter’s filing referred to as “a choice that spared her from the scrutiny of the discovery process_ including answering questions under oath and producing her communications.  “This decision was no accident_” the lawsuit states.   The “Gossip Girl” alum_ however_ also filed a lawsuit against Baldoni on Tuesday_ accusing him of emotional distress.  Reps for Lively and the New York Times weren’t immediately available to Page Six for comment.  Earlier this month_ Lively spoke to the Times after filing a complaint against Baldoni_ accusing him of sexual harassment.   “I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted_” she told the outlet.  The two worked together on the film adaption of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel about domestic violence from 2023 to early 2024.   Per the filing obtained by Page Six_ the “A Simple Favor” star claimed a meeting about Baldoni’s behavior on set as the movie’s antagonist and director.   In the meeting — which was also attended by Lively’s husband_ Ryan Reynolds — Baldoni was allegedly warned to stop talking about his porn addiction and showing the actress “nude videos or images of women.”  The movie producer was also allegedly told not to discuss the “cast and crew’s genitalia_” Lively’s weight or her late father. Baldoni was allegedly prohibited from adding more sex scenes to the film  According to the complaint_ Lively also accused her co-star of coordinating a smear campaign to ruin her reputation.  The “Jane the Virgin” star and Lively notably worked with intimacy coordinators on set to ensure they could “all feel safe.”  His and Wayfarer Studios’ lawyer_ Bryan Freedman_ also denied the allegations put forth by the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” star_ referring to them as “serious and categorically false.”  “These claims are completely false_ outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media_” he told us.  Freedman also claimed that his client was forced to hire a crisis manager because of Lively’s “multiple demands and threats_” which allegedly included threatening to not return to set or promote the film “if her demands were not met.”  When “It Ends With Us” was released in August_ sources told Page Six Baldoni allegedly made the mom of four feel “uncomfortable” on set.   Lively reportedly felt insecure about her figure and thought Baldoi_ who had previously experienced a back injury_ “fat-shamed” her when he asked how much she weighed so he could prepare to lift her for a scene.  Lively_ however_ came under fire when promoting the film and was criticized for her approach to questions about the movie’s theme of domestic violence.

At a news conference_ New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell described the killings as a “terrorist attack” and the city’s police chief said the act was clearly intentional.  Police Commissioner Anne Kirkpatrick said the driver was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”  “It was very intentional behavior. This man was trying to run over as many people as he could_” Kirkpatrick said.  FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan said officials were investigating the at least one suspected improvised explosive device at the scene.  The area is known as one of the largest New Year’s Eve destinations.  Crowds in the city were ballooning in anticipation of Wednesday night's Sugar Bowl college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome between Georgia and Notre Dame.  Kirkpatrick said police officers would work to ensure safety at the Sugar Bowl_ indicating that the game would go on as scheduled.  Kevin Garcia_ 22_ told CNN that he saw a truck slamming into people on a sidewalk and heard gunshots.  “A body came flying at me_” he said.  Whit Davis told the network that he heard people yelling and running to the back as he was leaving a nightclub.  “When they finally let us out of the club_ police waved us where to walk and were telling us to get out of the area fast. I saw a few dead bodies they couldn’t even cover up and tons of people receiving first aid_" said Davis_ 22.  The injured were taken to five hospitals_ the city’s emergency preparedness department said.  The White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed_ and the Justice Department said Attorney General Merrick Garland was also briefed.  The attack is the latest example of a vehicle being used as a weapon to carry out mass violence_ a trend that has alarmed law enforcement officials and that can be difficult to protect against.  A 50-year-old Saudi doctor plowed into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg last month_ killing four women and a 9-year-old boy. A man who drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee in 2021 is serving a life sentence after a judge rejected arguments from him and his family that mental illness drove him to do it. Six people were killed.  An Islamic extremist was sentenced last year to 10 life sentences for killing eight people with a truck on a bike path in Manhattan on Halloween in 2017. Also in 2017_ a self-proclaimed admirer of Adolf Hitler slammed his car into counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville_ Virginia and is now serving a life sentence.

Each January brings a quiet promise -- an invitation to start fresh_ to grow and to live more fully. Approach that promise with open hearts and gentle determination.  The new year often tempts us to aim for perfection -- to craft long lists of resolutions and demand drastic change overnight. But life isn’t about perfection. It’s about progress. It’s about showing up every day_ no matter how imperfectly_ and doing the best with what is available. This year_ focus on the idea that small_ steady steps forward are just as powerful as giant leaps.  Think about where you are right now. Challenges once thought impossible have already been overcome. Those triumphs_ both big and small_ are the foundation for the year ahead_ proof that anything can be tackled. It’s a cinch by the inch and a trial by the mile.  When setting goals this year_ start by asking yourself what makes you smile. What brings you joy and purpose? Instead of striving for external markers of success_ consider deeper goals that align with your values. Perhaps it’s cultivating more meaningful relationships_ prioritizing self-care or finding moments of gratitude in each day. Success isn’t about doing more; it’s about living more fully.  Give yourself permission to rest. The world often glorifies busyness_ but rest is essential. It’s in those quiet moments of reflection and renewal that clarity and strength are found. Allow yourself the grace to recharge. Rest isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s an act of self-compassion.  Redefine how setbacks are viewed. They aren’t failures but opportunities to learn and grow. Every stumble is a step closer to understanding_ every detour a chance to discover new paths. Be patient with yourself. Growth takes time_ and every effort counts. Celebrate progress_ no matter how small_ and trust that movement is happening in the right direction.  Remember the power of connection. Life isn’t meant to be navigated alone. Reach out to loved ones_ nurture relationships and lean on your support system when needed. Just as importantly_ extend kindness to those around you. A simple act of compassion can ripple outward in ways unimaginable_ making the world a brighter place for everyone.  Standing on the threshold of this new beginning_ choose hope over fear_ resilience over doubt_ and grace over judgment. Commit to living with intention_ savoring the present and embracing the messy_ beautiful journey of growth.

277564124,Gypsy-Rose Blanchard is officially a mom.   The reality TV star_ 33 — whose experience as a victim of Munchausen by proxy made national headlines — and her boyfriend Ken Urker have welcomed their first baby together_ a daughter named Aurora Raina Urker.   Urker shared a snap of the new mom cradling their baby in an Instagram post on Wednesday_ Jan. 1_ with the caption_ "Welcoming 2025 with the greatest gift of all 👼."   The photo shows Blanchard laying in a hospital bed as she and Urker hold their newborn. The two parents are looking down lovingly at their baby_ who is wearing a pink hat.   Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.    While chatting with PEOPLE in December_ Blanchard said that she can't take credit for her baby girl's name.   "Ken came up with that_" she said of Urker's idea to name their daughter Aurora Raina. "There's a whole backstory to it."   "Some people think that it's because of the Disney princess_" said Blanchard_ referencing Sleeping Beauty. Into her early 20s_ Blanchard was made to believe she was a child_ and made frequent trips to Disney parks due to fraudulent claims her mother made to children's charities.   "Some people think that it's because Kristy's dog is named Aurora Grace_" Blanchard said of her stepmom. "It's not because of that." The name_ she explained_ was inspired by something else.   The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!   "Back whenever Ken and I were together seven years ago_ both of us have a fascination with the Northern Lights_ and the proper term is the Aurora Borealis_" she shared of when she and Urker first dated during her prison stay. (Blanchard spent eight years in prison for her role in the 2015 murder of her mother Dee Dee_ who subjected her daughter to years of painful medical procedures she never needed.)   "I think it was maybe in 2018_ we wrote each other's future kid's name on pieces of paper and Aurora is what we both picked without even knowing each other was picking it_" Blanchard recalled.   She said they held on to that name and that memory even after she and Urker split and she married Ryan Anderson. "When we had broken up [it was like] 'Oh_ Aurora is never going to be born.' A lot of people think the origin is one thing_ but they don't know that little story."   Now back together with Urker and officially divorced from Anderson_ Blanchard is happy to be nesting and making meaningful plans for her growing family. "Some day we're going to see it_" she said of the natural light display that inspired their baby name choice. "After I'm off parole we're going to go. We're going to go to Sweden."   "For this upcoming year_ I'm really excited just to kind of obviously bring her into the world and have a lot of family time together_" said Blanchard_ author of new memoir My Time to Stand. "Obviously_ I'll be celebrating being off of parole_ so Kristy and dad are going to be the babysitter while Ken and I go to a nice vacation somewhere."   Blanchard and Urker first shared in July that they're expecting their first baby together after having rekindled their romance. Blanchard had filed to divorce her estranged husband Ryan Anderson in April.   Blanchard took a renatal paternity test and publicly confirmed on Nov. 5 that Urker is the father of her baby and not Anderson.
277524696,KYIV_ Ukraine — Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers that pass through the country_ almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor_ after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of last year.  At a summit in Brussels last month_ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn "additional billions ... on our blood_ on the lives of our citizens." But he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.  Ukraine's energy minister_ Herman Halushchenko_ confirmed on Wednesday morning that Kyiv had stopped the transit "in the interest of national security."  "This is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses. Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas_ and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today_" Halushchenko said in an update on the Telegram messaging app.  Russia's Gazprom said in a statement on Wednesday morning that it "has no technical and legal possibility" of sending gas through Ukraine_ due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.  Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in 2022_ Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country's pipeline network — set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union — to Europe_ under a five-year agreement. Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.  Before the war_ Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems_ one under the Baltic Sea_ one through Belarus and Poland_ one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.  After the war started_ Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines_ citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage_ but details of the attack remain murky.  The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship_ not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the U.S. filled the gap_ becoming the two largest suppliers.  Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. The move  Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023_ according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia_ which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.  Gazprom halted supplies to Austria's OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute_ but gas flows through Ukraine's pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan_ and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.  Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova_ which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.  Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire_ Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1_ citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies_ a figure the country has fiercely disputed_ citing international audits.  Moldova_ Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.  On Wednesday_ Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a "victory" for Russia's opponents. On a post on X_ Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to "blackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies_" including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany.  Moscow can still send gas to Hungary_ as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia_ through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.  Natural gas is used to generate electricity_ power industrial processes_ and in some cases to heat homes.  Separately_ overnight into New Year's Day_ Russia launched a drone strike on Kyiv that left two people dead under the rubble of a damaged building_ according to the city administration. At least six people were wounded across the Ukrainian capital_ according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.
277570574,President-elect Donald Trump denounced the New Orleans truck attack that left 10 people dead in the early hours of New Year’s Day as an “act of pure evil” — and implied the suspect had entered the US illegally.  “When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country_ that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media_ but it turned out to be true_” Trump_ 78_ posted on his Truth Social. “The crime rate in our country is at a level that nobody has ever seen before.”  “Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones_ including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!” the incoming president vowed.  This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

277747050,NEW ORLEANS -- A U.S. Army veteran driving a pickup that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wrought carnage on New Orleans' raucous New Year's celebration_ killing 15 people as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.  The FBI said it is investigating the attack early Wednesday as a terrorist act and does not believe the driver acted alone. Investigators found guns and what appeared to be an improvised explosive device in the vehicle_ along with other devices elsewhere in the city's famed French Quarter.  President Joe Biden said Wednesday evening that the FBI found videos that the driver had posted to social media hours before the attack in which he said he was inspired by the Islamic State group and expressed a desire to kill.  The rampage turned festive Bourbon Street into a macabre mayhem of maimed victims_ bloodied bodies and pedestrians fleeing for safety inside nightclubs and restaurants. In addition to the dead_ dozens of people were hurt. A college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome was postponed until Thursday.  The victims included Ni'Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux_ 18_ of Gulfport_ Miss._ who was set to start nursing school this month; Reggie Hunter_ 37_ a warehouse manager from Baton Rouge and father of two; and Tiger Bech_ a standout Louisiana high school athlete who played college football at Princeton University.  "Love you always brother!" Jack Bech_ Bech's brother and a football player at Texas Christian University_ wrote in a social media post about his family's loss. "You inspired me everyday now you get to be with me in every moment."  Dr. Dwight McKenna_ the New Orleans coroner_ said in an interview Wednesday evening that the number of fatalities could increase in the days ahead.  Zion Parsons_ 18_ of Gulfport_ Miss._ said he saw the truck "barreling through_ throwing people like in a movie scene_ throwing people into the air."  "Bodies_ bodies all up and down the street_ everybody screaming and hollering_" said Parsons_ whose friend Nikyra Dedeaux was among the people killed.  Video clips posted by witnesses on social media showed Bourbon Street emptied of crowds_ who had fled as the attack unfolded. Bodies of victims lay sprawled in the street_ near gutters littered with empty cups and broken strands of colorful Mardi Gras beads. Stunned bystanders looked down from second-floor balconies.  The attack_ by an assailant "set on hurting as many people as he could_" had targeted an area where crowds can be found at any hour_ said Jason Williams_ the district attorney who represents New Orleans.  "New Orleans is a place that doesn't close_" Williams said_ adding: "There's always people_ there's always people out."  As law enforcement officers swept through the French Quarter searching out suspicious packages and other potential threats and evidence Wednesday_ authorities urged the public to send tips to aid in the investigation_ and vowed to track down everyone involved in the attack.  For residents watching events unfold_ the day felt both frightening and surreal. Brian O'Brien_ 57_ a tour guide who lives a block from Bourbon Street_ said he woke Wednesday to find a state trooper inspecting a cooler about 100 feet from his stoop. According to O'Brien_ the officer said the cooler contained pipes_ tape and lots of nails_ and a bomb squad arrived soon after to detonate the contents.  O'Brien recalled hearing a shout of_ "Fire in the hole!" while he sat_ with his ears covered_ at a safe distance. "I'm still in shock_" he said.  "This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil_" New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said.  The driver "defeated" safety measures in place to protect pedestrians_ Kirkpatrick said_ and was "hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did."  The FBI identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Jabbar_ 42_ a U.S. citizen from Texas_ and said it is working to determine his potential associations with terrorist organizations.  "We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible_" FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan said at a news conference.  Investigators found multiple improvised explosives_ including two pipe bombs concealed within coolers and wired for remote detonation_ according to a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.  The bulletin_ relying on preliminary information gathered soon after the attack_ also said surveillance footage showed three men and a woman placing one of the devices_ but federal officials did not immediately confirm that detail and it wasn't clear who they were or what connection they had to the attack_ if any.  Jabbar drove a rented pickup onto a sidewalk_ going around a police car that was positioned to block vehicular traffic_ authorities said. A barrier system meant to prevent vehicle attacks was being repaired in preparation for the Super Bowl in February.  Jabbar was killed by police after he exited the truck and opened fire on responding officers_ Kirkpatrick said. Three officers returned fire. Two were shot and are in stable condition.  Investigators recovered a handgun and AR-style rifle_ according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  There were also deadly explosions in Honolulu and outside a Las Vegas hotel owned by President-elect Donald Trump. Biden said the FBI is looking into whether the Las Vegas explosion was connected to the New Orleans attack but had "nothing to report" as of Wednesday evening.  A photo circulated among law enforcement officials showed a bearded Jabbar wearing camouflage next to the truck after he was killed. The intelligence bulletin obtained by the AP said he was wearing a ballistic vest and helmet. The flag of the Islamic State group was on the truck's trailer hitch_ the FBI said.  "For those people who don't believe in objective evil_ all you have to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning_" U.S. Sen. John Kennedy_ a Louisiana Republican_ said. "If this doesn't trigger the gag reflex of every American_ every fair-minded American_ I'll be very surprised."  Jabbar joined the Army in 2007_ serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010_ the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.  Jabbar had converted to Islam and acted erratically in recent months_ said Dwayne Marsh_ who married Jabbar's ex-wife. Records showed that he had been married twice and had reported financial problems to his ex-wife's lawyer in 2022.  Before authorities identified the driver as an American citizen and an Army veteran_ some early reports suggested the vehicle had come across the border from Mexico. President-elect Donald Trump quickly asserted on social media that his condemnations of immigrants in the country without legal permission had been validated.  "When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country_ that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media_ but it turned out to be true_" Trump said on his website_ Truth Social.  Attorney General Merrick Garland said federal investigators were treating the attack as an act of terrorism. The use of the truck as a weapon_ along with the discovery of an improvised bomb in a cooler near the crashed vehicle_ led officials to conclude that the driver's goal had been to inflict civilian casualties.  "My heart is broken for those who began their year by learning people they love were killed in this horrific attack_" Garland said. He vowed to "deploy every available resource" to the investigation.  Hours after the attack_ several coroner's office vans were parked on the corner of Bourbon and Canal streets_ cordoned off by police tape with crowds of dazed tourists standing around_ some trying to navigate their luggage through the labyrinth of blockades.  Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry urged people to avoid the area_ which remained an active crime scene.  "We looked out our front door and saw caution tape and dead silence and it's eerie_" said Tessa Cundiff_ an Indiana native who moved to the French Quarter a few years ago. "This is not what we fell in love with_ it's sad."  Nearby_ life went on as normal in the city known to some for a motto that translates to "let the good times roll." At a cafe a block from where the truck came to rest_ people crowded in for breakfast as upbeat pop music played. Two blocks away_ people drank at a bar_ seemingly as if nothing happened.  Biden_ speaking from the presidential retreat at Camp David_ called the attack a "despicable" and "heinous act." Addressing the victims and the people of New Orleans_ he said: "I want you to know I grieve with you. Our nation grieves with you as you mourn and as you heal."  "My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday_" Biden said in an earlier written statement. "There is no justification for violence of any kind_ and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities."  The attack is the latest example of a vehicle being used as a weapon to carry out mass violence and the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years.  FBI officials have repeatedly warned about an elevated international terrorism threat due to the Israel-Hamas war. In the last year_ the agency has disrupted other potential attacks_ including in October when it arrested an Afghan man in Oklahoma for a supposed Election Day plot targeting large crowds.

The suspect died at the scene.  According to the president_ the FBI has found that the alleged killer_ Shamsud-Din Jabbar_ was an American citizen born in Texas.  “He served in the United States Army on active duty for many years; he also served in the Army reserve until a few years ago_” he said.  “The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack_ he posted videos on social media_ indicating he was inspired by ISIS_ expressing a desire to kill.”  Biden noted that an ISIS flag was found in the rented vehicle used for the attack. Explosives were also found in the truck and nearby.

277792900,The person who authorities believe died in the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters outside President-elect Donald Trump’s Las Vegas hotel was an active-duty U.S. Army soldier_ three U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Thursday.   Two law enforcement officials identified the man inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck as Matthew Livelsberger. The law enforcement officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.   Three U.S. officials said Livelsberger was an active-duty Army member_ who spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg_ a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to Army special forces command. The officials also spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of his service.   The truck explosion came hours after a driver_ 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar_ rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day_ killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone.  Jabbar_ a U.S. Army veteran_ also spent time at Fort Bragg_ but one official said so far there is no overlap in their assignments there.

277703846,NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A U.S. Army veteran who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year’s revelers in New Orleans_ killing 15 people_ had posted videos to social media hours before the carnage saying he was inspired by the Islamic State group and expressing a desire to kill_ the president said.  The FBI said it was investigating early Wednesday’s attack in which the driver steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police as a terrorist act and did not believe he acted alone.   Investigators found guns and what appeared to be an improvised explosive device in the vehicle — which bore the flag of the Islamic State group — along with other explosive devices elsewhere in the city’s famed French Quarter.  President Joe Biden said Wednesday evening that the FBI found the videos the driver posted to social media. He called the attack a “despicable” and “heinous act.”   The rampage turned festive Bourbon Street into a macabre scene of maimed victims_ bloodied bodies and pedestrians fleeing for safety inside nightclubs and restaurants. In addition to the dead_ dozens of people were hurt. A college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome was postponed until Thursday.  Zion Parsons_ 18_ of Gulfport_ Mississippi_ said he saw the truck “barreling through_ throwing people like in a movie scene_ throwing people into the air.”  “Bodies_ bodies all up and down the street_ everybody screaming and hollering_” said Parsons_ whose friend Nikyra Dedeaux was among the people killed.  “This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil_” New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said.  The attack is the latest example of a vehicle being used as a weapon to carry out mass violence and the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years.   The driver “defeated” safety measures in place to protect pedestrians_ Kirkpatrick said_ and was “hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”  The FBI identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Jabbar_ 42_ a U.S. citizen from Texas_ and said it was working to determine any potential associations with terrorist organizations.  “We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible_” FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alethea Duncan said at a news conference.  Investigators found multiple improvised explosives_ including two pipe bombs that were concealed within coolers and wired for remote detonation_ according to a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.  The bulletin_ relying on preliminary information gathered soon after the attack_ also cited surveillance footage that it said showed three men and a woman placing one of the devices_ but federal officials did not immediately confirm that detail and it wasn’t clear who they were or what connection they had to the attack_ if any.  Jabbar drove a rented pickup truck onto a sidewalk_ going around a police car that was positioned to block vehicular traffic_ authorities said. A barrier system meant to prevent vehicle attacks was being repaired in preparation for the Super Bowl in February.  Jabbar was killed by police after he exited the truck and opened fire on responding officers_ Kirkpatrick said. Three officers returned fire. Two were shot and are in stable condition.  Investigators recovered a handgun and AR-style rifle_ according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  There were also deadly explosions in Honolulu and outside a Las Vegas hotel owned by President-elect Donald Trump. President Joe Biden said the FBI was looking into whether the Las Vegas explosion was connected to the New Orleans attack but had “nothing to report” as of Wednesday evening.  A photo circulated among law enforcement officials showed a bearded Jabbar wearing camouflage next to the truck after he was killed. The intelligence bulletin obtained by the AP said he was wearing a ballistic vest and helmet. The flag of the Islamic State group was on the truck’s trailer hitch_ the FBI said.  “For those people who don’t believe in objective evil_ all you have to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning_” U.S. Sen. John Kennedy_ a Louisiana Republican_ said. “If this doesn’t trigger the gag reflex of every American_ every fair-minded American_ I’ll be very surprised.”  Jabbar joined the Army in 2007_ serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010_ the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.  Hours after the attack_ several coroner’s office vans were parked on the corner of Bourbon and Canal streets_ cordoned off by police tape with crowds of dazed tourists standing around_ some trying to navigate their luggage through the labyrinth of blockades.  Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry urged people to avoid the area_ which remained an active crime scene.  “We looked out our front door and saw caution tape and dead silence and it’s eerie_” said Tessa Cundiff_ an Indiana native who moved to the French Quarter a few years ago. “This is not what we fell in love with_ it’s sad.”  Nearby_ life went on as normal in the city known to some for a motto that translates to “let the good times roll.” At a cafe a block from where the truck came to rest_ people crowded in for breakfast as upbeat pop music played. Two blocks away_ people drank at a bar_ seemingly as if nothing happened.  Biden_ speaking from the presidential retreat at Camp David_ addressed the victims and the people of New Orleans: “I want you to know I grieve with you. Our nation grieves with you as you mourn and as you heal.”  “My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday_” Biden said in an earlier written statement. “There is no justification for violence of any kind_ and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities.”  FBI officials have repeatedly warned about an elevated international terrorism threat due to the Israel-Hamas war. In the last year_ the agency has disrupted other potential attacks_ including in October when it arrested an Afghan man in Oklahoma for an alleged Election Day plot targeting large crowds.  Tucker reported from Washington_ D.C. and Mustian reported from Black Mountain_ North Carolina. Associated Press reporters Stephen Smith_ Chevel Johnson and Brett Martel in New Orleans; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; Alanna Durkin Richer_ Tara Copp and Zeke Miller in Washington_ D.C.; Darlene Superville in New Castle_ Delaware; Colleen Long in West Palm Beach_ Florida; and Michael R.

277920904,U.S. President Joe Biden has decided to block Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion takeover bid of U.S. Steel_ The Washington Post reported on Friday_ citing two unnamed administrative officials who did not have permission to speak about the matter.  The White House is expected to announce Biden’s decision as soon as Friday_ according to The Washington Post.  The decision on whether to let the deal proceed was referred to Biden on Dec. 23 after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States failed to reach a consensus_ said U.S. Steel.  Biden had 15 days to approve or block the deal after the CFIUS evaluation reached his desk_ which prompted Nippon Steel to extend the transaction’s deadline to the first quarter of 2025 from the third or fourth quarter of 2024.  The CFIUS was concerned that_ following the acquisition_ Nippon Steel could cut the production capacity of U.S. Steel_ which would pose a risk to the national security of the United States.  “Potential reduced output by U.S. Steel could lead to supply shortages and delays that could affect industries critical to national security_” The Washington Post reported the CFIUS as stating in its evaluation.  To assuage that worry_ Nippon Steel on Tuesday offered the U.S. government the ability to veto any reductions to the company’s steel production.  Nippon Steel had previously offered a number of concessions regarding the transaction_ such as keeping U.S. Steel headquartered in Pittsburgh_ Pennsylvania_ and staffing the board of directors of U.S. Steel with U.S. citizens.  The deal was backed by U.S. Steel shareholders_ who voted in April for it to go through.  “The overwhelming support from our stockholders is a clear endorsement that they recognize the compelling rationale for our transaction with NSC_” said U.S. Steel President and CEO David B. Burritt.  But those factors were not enough to sway Biden_ who has long publicly opposed the deal. In March_ Biden released an official statement saying that “it is vital for [U.S. Steel] to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.”   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also voiced his resistance to Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition.  “I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company_ in this case Nippon Steel of Japan_” Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Dec. 2.  Japan-listed Nippon Steel shares were last up 1.2% at 1 a.m. Eastern Time.  — CNBC’s Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.

277897762,SEOUL_ South Korea (AP) — South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a nearly six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It’s the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.  The country’s anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon’s residence for hours due to concerns about their safety. The agency expressed “serious regret about the attitude of the suspect_ who did not respond to a process by law.”  Yoon_ a former prosecutor_ has defied investigators’ attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12_ when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation_ making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.  Investigators from the country’s anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon_ apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament_ declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.  Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14_ accusing him of rebellion_ while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.   A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday_ but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.   Yoon’s lawyers_ who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday_ say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.   The office said it will discuss further actions_ but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.  Yoon’s lawyers have also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials_ which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators_ lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said that police officers don’t have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon_ and could face arrest by either the “presidential security service or any citizens.” They didn’t elaborate further on the claim.   If investigators manage to detain Yoon_ they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise_ he will be released after 48 hours.  Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon’s residence on Friday_ forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved subfreezing temperatures for hours_ waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans vowing to protect him. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.  Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon’s detention_ but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon’s lawyers_ Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il_ were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn’t immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.   Seok Dong-hyeon_ one of several lawyers on Yoon’s legal team_ said the agency’s efforts to detain Yoon were “reckless” and showed an “outrageous discard for law.”  South Korea’s Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service_ which controls the residence itself_ refused to comment. South Korea’s YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.   As the standoff prologned_ the liberal opposition Democratic Party called on the country’s acting leader_ Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok_ to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn’t immediately comment on the situation.   “Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime_” said Jo Seung-lae_ a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must “remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility_” Jo said.   Yoon’s defense minister_ police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.  Yoon’s presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court_ which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office.  The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo_ who became acting president after Yoon’s powers were suspended_ over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of Yoon’s case.   Facing growing pressure_ the new acting president_ Choi_ appointed two new justices on Tuesday_ which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon’s impeachment.

278091578,By MICHAEL R. SISAK and JENNIFER PELTZ  NEW YORK (AP) — In an extraordinary turn_ a judge Friday set President-elect Donald Trump’s sentencing in his hush money case for Jan. 10 — little over a week before he’s due to return to the White House — but promised not to jail him.  The development marks yet another twist in the singular case.  Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in 2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong.  After Trump’s Nov. 5 election_ Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.  Trump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would otherwise pose unconstitutional “disruptions” to the incoming president’s ability to run the country.  Prosecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency_ but they insisted the conviction should stand.  They suggested various options_ such as freezing the case during his term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal defendants die while appealing their cases.  Trump takes office Jan. 20.
277887610,Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit filed over its Siri voice assistant_ according to a newly filed court document.  Lawyers for people who sued Apple after they said Siri recorded their conversations and shared the conversations with advertisers told a federal court in California that Apple does not oppose their proposed settlement_ which features a payment of $95 million.  Plaintiffs said that some of their conversations in their home that should not have been recorded were used by Apple and its partners to target them with advertisements for Olive Garden_ Air Jordans_ and other products.  “Because the intercepted conversations took place in private to the exclusion of others_ only through Apple’s surreptitious recording could these specific advertisements be pinpointed to Plaintiffs Lopez and A.L_” the suit stated.  Apple said in filings that Siri lets users know when it is recording and that the court should dismiss the suit.  A federal judge only threw out part of the suit_ leading to the new proposed settlement.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the court should certify a class that includes all people who own or owned a Siri device_ live in the United States and its territories_ and whose confidential communications were obtained by Apple “as a result of unintended Siri activation” between Sept. 17_ 2014_ and the date of the settlement. The former date is when Apple introduced the “Hey_ Siri_” activation feature.  A notice sent to owners and former owners would direct them to submit a claim form through a website to get a chunk of the $95 million.  The lawyers for the plaintiffs can seek up to $29.6 million for fees and expenses_ according to the proposed settlement.  As part of the settlement_ Apple will confirm within six months that it has permanently deleted Siri audio recordings collected by the company prior to October 2019. Apple must also post a webpage explaining how users can opt in to an option to improve Siri on Siri devices_ and detailing what information Apple stores from users who decide to opt in.  Apple and a lawyer representing the plaintiffs did not return The Epoch Times’ requests for comment.  U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White must still approve the settlement.

Coach Sean McDermott has already said he plans to rest numerous starters_ with Josh Allen scheduled to take the first offensive snap — and not many more — for the purpose of extending his consecutive games starting streak to 115 (including playoffs). That means Trubisky will get his most extensive opportunity to run the offense this season.

Buffalo has matched the NFL single-season record with 13 players scoring at least one touchdown receiving.  Patriots player to watch  QB Drake Maye. He has thrown a touchdown pass in eight consecutive games_ the longest streak by a rookie in franchise history. He also has a 66.8% completion rate so far.

The Bills are 8-2 in their past 10 meetings_ including the playoffs_ in a stretch that coincides with Tom Brady leaving New England for Tampa Bay following the 2019 season.

The Bills have already set single-season records for most points (509)_ touchdowns scored (63) and 40-point outings (four). ... Since 2018_ Buffalo has scored 40 or more points 13 times with Allen starting — and 14 including a 2018 start by backup Matt Barkley.

The Patriots are 2-6 in one-score games this season. ... Maye has at least one turnover in eight consecutive games. ... TE Hunter Henry enters the week fifth on New England’s list among tight ends with 19 TD catches. With one more he will be the fifth Patriots tight end to reach 20. ... S/ST Brendan Schooler was the lone player selected to the initial Pro Bowl Games roster. He has a team-leading nine special teams tackles this season.

278439046,WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees_ affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers_ firefighters_ police officers and in other public service jobs.  Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity_ though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds_ which face a looming insolvency crisis.   The bill rescinds two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources_ including public retirement programs from a state or local government.  The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023_ there were 745_679 people_ about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries_ who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people_ or about 3% of all beneficiaries_ were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380_000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses_ according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1_190 for 390_000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.  Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security’s regular cost-of-living adjustments.  The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond_ meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner “shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account” changes in the law. It’s not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.  Edward Kelly_ president of the International Association of Fire Fighters_ said firefighters across the country are “excited to see the change — we’ve righted a 40-year wrong.” Kelly said the policy was “far more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.”  The IAFF has roughly 320_000 members_ which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.   “Now firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire_” Kelly said.  Sherrod Brown_ who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years_ lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders_ president of the American Federation of State_ County and Municipal Employees labor union_ thanked Brown for his advocacy.  “Over two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into_” Saunders said in a statement. “Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.”  National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is “a historic victory that will improve the lives of educators_ first responders_ postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.”   And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation_ others_ including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota_ Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina_ voted against it. “We caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis_” Tillis told The Associated Press last month.   Still_ Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees.  The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people_ including retirees_ disabled people and children_ receive Social Security benefits.   The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration_ which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency_ currently under a hiring freeze_ has a staff of about 56_645 — the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever.  The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program’s insolvency date by about half a year. ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.

278352964,Mars Conceals the Motive  The Mars retrograde emphasizes how useful it is to know what people want. The ones that tell you up front honor you with the directness of their honesty_ saving you time and making your options obvious. Those who hide what they want may want too much_ or they want something that is not in your best interest to give. As always_ heed intuition.  CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Originality will count for many points today and could make the difference between being chosen or not. Luckily_ uniqueness is your strength. No one else carries your exact blend of hopes_ memories or fears. What you have can’t be replicated.  AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Sometimes when you sense tensions that others don’t seem to be aware of_ you think you might be imagining it. You’re not imagining it. But it’s not just you who is sensitive to subtle conflicts. It’s just that no one is letting on.  PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Telling your story well will put you in a position to win friends and business. But beyond the connections_ storytelling is how you remind yourself of your own power and purpose. Others will listen_ root for you and see themselves in your success.  ARIES (March 21-April 19). Brevity flatters almost anything you pick up today. Make quick work of tasks and communications and you’ll breeze through the dutiful part of the day_ leaving plenty of room to stretch your time around the enjoyable parts.  TAURUS (April 20-May 20). Belonging isn’t about fitting together seamlessly_ rather it’s a willingness to seek harmony in the imperfect and tolerate the edges that don’t quite align. The ideal moment to start friendship is the moment you think to do it. Seize the day.  GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You trust the one you’re following. You trust the universe. You trust yourself. And yet_ moving forward still may seem a bit scary. It’s OK to fling your arms wide open and keep your eyes shut.  CANCER (June 22-July 22). Just a reminder: You’re inherently interesting and worthy_ so you don’t need impress anyone_ nor should you attempt to hide anything about yourself out of fear of being uncool. Embrace your quirks. They’re your superpower.  LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). A return on investment is not a selfish thing to want. Maybe you should even expect it today. After all_ you gave everything that was asked of you. If you gave in the right direction_ you’ll either get back or feel like you don’t need to.  VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). While you’re deeply moved by recent developments_ it feels incomplete unless you know someone else is sharing in the benefits. This is why you’ll reach out and share the bounty at every mile marker of your journey.  LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). A reputation is like a pet or a child. It’s called “yours_” but it has a life of its own. You didn’t create it_ and you don’t total control it_ but there’s much you can do to influence it. That’s the work of the day_ which you’re well equipped to take on to successful effect.  SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). You’re really onto something. And when you start to get a little tired_ push past it. The good stuff is on the other side_ after the slump and the arrival of your second wind.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). One way to rev up the stress levels is to think life should be something other than what it is. One way to calm the stress levels is to think the way things are is mighty fine with you_ and perhaps even mighty fine in general.  TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 5). Hard challenges are for you. Your drive to make a difference has you claiming them on purpose_ knowing you’re up for it_ sensing they’ll make you great -- and you’re right. With legendary resilience_ you’ll keep coming back to the task in a new way until you’ve figured it out. More highlights: an intriguing mystery_ tender connections_ and rewards that surpass your expectation. Scorpio and Pisces adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 8_ 13_ 39_ 2 and 1.

278549596,Lefty Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation from office this week_ according to a report.  Three sources told the Globe and Mail_ a Canadian outlet_ on Sunday that Trudeau_ 53_ could reveal he’s leaving as Liberal Party Leader before a critical national caucus meeting on Wednesday.  It was unclear what day he could announce his resignation_ but it reportedly could happen as early as Monday_ the sources said.  The bombshell report comes as an embattled Trudeau has faced increasing calls for his resignation as a Donald Trump presidency – and the threat of 25% tariffs on all products north of the border – looms large.  The prime minister was struck with a devastating blow after his then-finance minister_ Chrystia Freeland_ quit last month over a deepening divide between the two over the future of Canada’s economy.  One of the sources told the Globe and Mail Trudeau knows he needs to announce his resignation before the Liberal caucus meets on Wednesday so it doesn’t appear he was pushed out by his own members.  It was unknown if Trudeau_ who has led Canada for nearly a decade_ would stick around as prime minister until a new leader is picked or leave right away_ according to the outlet.  A fourth source said he would only step down because he believes the caucus no longer supports him and not because he doesn’t think he can still do the job.   The Liberal Party is widely expected to lose power to the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilevre in an election that must be held by late October based on public polling.  Trudeau has consistently been needled by Trump since the Republican won November’s presidential election. The incoming commander in chief even suggested Canada become the United States’ 51st state.

278629526,Before the 2021 riot_ Mr. Trump addressed his supporters at the Ellipse near the White House_ telling them: “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell_ you’re not going to have a country anymore_” encouraging them to march to the Capitol. In the end_ eight Senate Republicans and 139 House Republicans objected to certifying the election results.  This year_ Democrats and Republicans alike are hoping for a smooth process. House Republicans on Friday managed to put aside their divisions and re-elect Speaker Mike Johnson to his post_ in part because they wanted to ensure a smooth certification of Mr. Trump’s electoral victory.  And Democrats_ from the president on down_ have telegraphed that they plan to lead by example. Mr. Biden in November extended to Mr. Trump some of the traditions that he was deprived of four years earlier_ inviting the president-elect to the White House to acknowledge his victory and telling him that the administration would do “everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated_ have what you need.”  In her concession speech in November_ Ms. Harris said that she had spoken to Mr. Trump and “congratulated him on his victory” and “told him that we will help him and his team with their transition.”  On Monday_ Ms. Harris will take on the largely ceremonial role that four years ago put Mr. Pence in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump and the mob of his supporters_ some of whom chanted “hang Mike Pence” as they marched through the Capitol.

Zendaya and Holland_ both 28_ confirmed their romance when they were spotted kissing in July 2021 — years after being cast as love interests in 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”  They have been the subject of engagement speculation several times_ with Zendaya herself speaking out about the rumors in 2023 after fans were convinced they took the next step when she shared a selfie with a ring on that finger.   “I can’t post anything … I posted [the photo] for my hat_ like_ not for the ring on my right finger you guys!” she clarified in a since-deleted video. “Seriously_ you think that’s how I would drop the news?”  Notably_ the Disney Channel alum has worn a ring on her left ring finger multiple times_ including for her April 2024 Vogue cover.  While it’s no secret they’re head over heels for one another_ Zendaya has previously explained why she prefers to keep her romance with the “Uncharted” actor private.   “Parts of my life_ I accept_ are going to be public. I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love_” she told Elle in 2023. “But also_ I do have control over what I choose to share.  “It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun_ either. I am navigating it more than ever now.”  Holland did not attend the Golden Globes with Zendaya_ who is nominated for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture musical or comedy for her role in “Challengers.”  He explained why he doesn’t usually walk red carpets with her in his Men’s Health cover story released this week.  “It’s not my moment_ it’s her moment_ and if we go together_ it’s about us_” he said.   Zendaya arrived at the Golden Globes in a satin burnt-orange dress from Louis Vuitton. She styled her hair in a bob with Old Hollywood curls.   After her “Challengers” nomination was announced in December 2024_ she gushed that her “heart was so full.”  “I’m so deeply grateful to be nominated among such incredible talent_” she added. “I admire each one of them and their absolutely brilliant work.”

278666352,WASHINGTON (AP) — Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s decision to block a proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel..  The suit_ filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia_ alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies’ due process.   “From the outset of the process_ both Nippon Steel and U. S. Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the Transaction will enhance_ not threaten_ United States national security_ including by revitalizing communities that rely on American steel_ bolstering the American steel supply chain_ and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry against the threat from China_” the companies said in a prepared statement Monday. “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”  Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel’s aging blast furnace operations in Gary_ Indiana_ and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers_ our nation is less strong and less secure_” he said in a statement.   While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to Japan’s relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S. president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm.   Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks.   The president’s decision to block the deal comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States_ known as CFIUS_ failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month_ and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15 days to reach a final decision.  In a separate lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania_ the companies accused steel-making rival Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and its CEO_ Lourenco Goncalves of “engaging in a coordinated series of anticompetitive and racketeering activities” to block the deal.   In 2023 before U.S. Steel accepted the buyout offer from Nippon_ Cleveland-Cliffs offered to buy U.S. Steel for $7 billion. U.S. Steel turned the offer down and ended up accepting the nearly $15 billion all-cash offer from Nippon Steel_ which is the deal that Biden nixed Friday.
278559218,Demi Moore delivered an emotional acceptance speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday_ expressing gratitude at finally feeling acknowledged by the industry after years of work.The iconic actor took to the stage to accept the award for Best Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical/Comedy for her leading role in body horror film The Substance. It was a highly competitive category as well_ with Moore beating out Amy Adams (Nightbitch)_ Cynthia Erivo (Wicked)_ Karla Sofía Gascón (Emilia Pérez)_ Mikey Madison (Anora)_ and Zendaya (Challengers).   Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley channel 'The Substance' at the Golden Globes  "I'm just in shock right now_" said Moore. "I've been doing this a long time_ like over 45 years_ and this is the first time I've ever won anything as an actor."Moore's claim isn't strictly true_ though her list of accolades is admittedly sparse. The actor's performance in Ghost won her the Saturn Award for Best Actress in 1991_ and the Indiana Film Journalists Association awarded her Best Lead Performance for The Substance late last year. She was also part of Margin Call's ensemble win at the 2012 Independent Spirit Awards.Even so_ tonight's Golden Globe marks Moore's first major solo win throughout her entire acting career.   window.videoEmbeds = window.videoEmbeds || [];  window.videoEmbeds.push({  elemId: 'video-container-9SvW3XJP5Ic'_  data: {"slug":"9SvW3XJP5Ic"_"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9SvW3XJP5Ic"_"start_time":""}_  videoPlayerType: 'in-content'  "Thirty years ago I had a producer tell me that I was a 'popcorn actress' and at that time I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have_" said a teary Moore. "That I could do movies that were successful_ that made a lot of money_ but that I couldn't be acknowledged. And I bought in and I believed that. "And that corroded me over time to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete. Maybe I'd done what I was supposed to do."Moore shared that she had been at a "low point" when she was presented with The Substance's script_ "and the universe told me that 'you're not done.'""In those moments when we don't think we're smart enough_ or pretty enough_ or skinny enough_ or successful enough_ or basically just not enough_" said Moore. "I had a woman say to me_ 'Just know_ you will never be enough. But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.'"You can check out all the Golden Globes winners in Mashable's list.
278676056,After a disappointing 2024 season_ the Jacksonville Jaguars decided it was time for a change.  The Jaguars fired head coach Doug Pederson on Monday after finishing the year with a 4-13 record_ ending his tenure after three seasons.  "Doug is an accomplished football man who will undoubtedly enjoy another chapter in his impressive NFL career_ and I will be rooting for Doug and his wife Jeannie when that occasion arrives_" team owner Shad Khan said. "As much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better_ I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans_ who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded. In that spirit_ the time to summon new leadership is now."  That "new leadership" won't extend to the front office_ though_ with Khan citing how he intends to continue working with general manager Trent Baalke to right the ship this offseason.  Pederson was asked about his job status earlier in the season when Jacksonville lost its first four games and he took exception to the question_ responding_ "That's kind of a weird question_ but OK."  The questions about Pederson's standing came up again leading up to the team's Week 11 game against the Detroit Lions.  The Jaguars wound up suffering an embarrassing 52-6 loss. They had a bye in Week 12_ so that seemed like a good opportunity to make a change and get the interim coach acclimated before they returned to play against the Houston Texans. However_ Pederson was retained through the end of the year until the team decided it was finally time to move on from him.  Pederson's run with the Jaguars got off to a strong start after he was hired in 2022_ as he led the team to an AFC South title with a 9-8 record in his first year. The team overcame a 27-point deficit in its AFC Wild Card matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers to earn a 31-30 win_ the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. Jacksonville fell to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round that year.  Unfortunately_ the Jaguars failed to build off the promising start to Pederson's tenure. After opening the 2023 season with an 8-3 record_ Jacksonville lost five of its last six games to finish 9-8 for the second straight season_ which wasn't good enough to qualify for the playoffs this time around.  Khan told the team before training camp that "winning now is the expectation." The team failed to live up to that mandate throughout the season_ leading to the decision to part ways with Pederson.  Jacksonville must now find a replacement who can maximize the talents of star quarterback Trevor Lawrence_ who was limited to 10 games this season due to a shoulder injury.

279012756,Near the end of “A Complete Unknown_” the Bob Dylan biopic that centers on his move into rock in 1965_ an earnest_ slim_ bearded_ clearly nervous M.C. struggles to pacify a wildly divided crowd that has just heard Dylan sing three plugged-in songs at the Newport Folk Festival. Boomers will immediately recognize that M.C. as Peter Yarrow_ himself a festival headliner in the folk-revival trio Peter_ Paul and Mary.  Yarrow_ who died on Tuesday at 86_ was also a member of the Newport Folk Festival board that had been striving to balance the event’s founding mission — bringing traditional music to a wider audience — with the preferences of that wider audience_ which was more drawn to pop than purism. Among the festival organizers_ Yarrow was an advocate for the topical songwriting and contemporary sounds that some old-line folk aficionados resisted. (According to “White Bicycles” by the producer Joe Boyd_ who was running the sound system at Newport in 1965_ Yarrow was also at the control board during Bob Dylan’s loud_ divisive electric set_ and refused to turn it down as other board members demanded.) And in the early_ idealistic years of the folk revival_ Yarrow_ Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers (who died in 2009) strummed and harmonized their way toward that conscientious balance of folk and pop. It was sincere_ and fleeting.

279011086,Trump made the comments as he complained that the U.S. had a large trade deficit with both Mexico and Canada. He has raised similar concerns since winning November’s election and vowed to impose steep tariffs on both neighboring countries.  Both outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo have spoken with Trump in recent months about his tariff threats.  Trump on Tuesday bashed Mexico as a “very dangerous place” that was “essentially run by the cartels.”  He suggested Canada merge with the U.S. after Trudeau announced his resignation on Monday.
278804650,LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have settled their divorce and are asking a judge to finalize their breakup.  Lopez filed documents Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court that show the former couple settled their divorce through mediation in September_ about a month after she filed for divorce.  While most of the financial details of their split were not publicly filed_ neither star will pay the other spousal support. Lopez will drop Affleck from her legal name once the divorce is finalized.  The superstar couple married in July 2022. Lopez filed for divorce in August 2024_ although the couple said in court filings that they separated in April 2023.  After meeting_ falling in love and getting engaged in the early 2000s — and starring together in 2003’s infamous “Gigli” and 2004’s “Jersey Girl” — the couple parted ways_ blaming in part the pressure of the public eye.  But to the delight of many and perhaps the skepticism of others_ they reunited two decades later and married.  Records filed Monday show the pair resolved the financial aspects of their divorce through mediation and without long-drawn-out proceedings in court.  The couple have no children together. Affleck divorced Jennifer Garner_ with whom he has three children_ in 2018. Lopez has been married four times and has twins with singer Marc Anthony.  The settlement documents were first reported by celebrity website TMZ.  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

279013720,President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he wouldn’t rule out using “military force” to make Greenland and the Panama Canal US territories.  “No_ I can’t assure you on either of those two_” the incoming president told a reporter asking about the use of military force or economic coercion to acquire the territories.  “We need Greenland for national security purposes. I’ve been told that for a long time_ long before I even ran. I mean_ people have been talking about it for a long time. You have approximately 45_000 people there. People really don’t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it_ but if they do_ they should give it up_ because we need it for national security_” Trump said at his press conference at Mar-a-Lago.  He argued that there are Chinese and Russian ships around the world’s largest island and “we’re not letting that happen.”  He slammed former President Jimmy Carter for giving away the Panama Canal during his presidency and said he’s worried that China is controlling the waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
278953468,Richard Cohen_ a veteran journalist and the husband Meredith Vieira_ died on Christmas Eve at the age of 76 after living more than 50 years with multiple sclerosis and surviving two cancer diagnoses.   News of his death was announced on the Today show on Tuesday_ Jan. 7. Hoda Kotb said that he was "surrounded by his family and love" at the time of his death_ including Vieira and their three kids: daughter Lily_ 32_ and sons Gabriel 34_ and Benjamin_ 36.   All had been together around Thanksgiving_ Kotb noted_ "concerned they were going to lose him early. Instead_ they got a glorious month with their dad."   "She's in really good spirits_" Savannah Guthrie added_ of Vieira. "She was such a beautiful and devoted wife to Richard and he adored Meredith. And hanging out with them_ they were like the most fun and entertaining_ irreverent_ cool couple you could hang out with."   Cohen and Viera were married for 38 years_ tying the knot in 1986. Diagnosed with MS at the age of 25_ he famously told Vieira he had the chronic disease when they were on their second date.   “I told her about the illness_ because I sort of learned the hard way to get it on the table_" he recalled to Yahoo Life in 2019. "And she really didn’t blink."   I’ve always been of the school of thought that you could get hit by a bus the next day_ any one of us could_" said Vieira. "It certainly wasn’t enough to scare me off.”   Instead_ Vieira became Cohen's fiercest supporter. Over their near four decades together_ she stood by Cohen's side as he left his long reporting career for CBS News and became an advocate for those living with MS.   The chronic disease — which affects the central nervous system including the brain_ spinal cord_ and optic nerves — would eventually lead Vieira to step aside from her own career in broadcast journalism. An original co-host on The View_ she left the daytime talk show in 2006 to co-anchor today. She remaind on the program through 2011_ when she retired to spend more time with Cohen and their kids.   “Time is one of those weird things_" she said on air at the time. "You can never get enough of it_ and it just keeps ticking away. And I know that I want to spend more of mine with my husband_ Richard_ and my kids."   This is a developing story_ check back for more updates.
278835778,Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to remove special counsel Jack Smith from his post and either decline to release Smith's upcoming report detailing his investigations into the president-elect or hand over the matter to Trump's incoming administration_ according to a letter released Monday. The letter_ addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department_ alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his dual investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to "put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively." The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove_ Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his upcoming administration. Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect_ one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump_ which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing. The classified documents case was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida who ruled in July 2024 that Garland unlawfully appointed Smith_ a finding the Justice Department disputed and was appealing in the runup to the presidential election. The 2020 election-related charges against Trump were dismissed after Trump was re-elected. The special counsel wrote that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Federal regulations dictate that upon the completion of any special counsel probe_ the investigative team is to submit a report detailing its findings to the attorney general for review. Garland has previously pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and so far kept to that promise_ including after a separate special counsel_ Robert Hur_ submitted his findings about President Biden's handling of classified records. Mr. Biden's legal team raised objections to the attorney general over characterizations in that report_ which were rebuffed by Justice Department officials when the complete findings — including characterizations of Mr. Biden's age — were publicly released. Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration_ sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Following its submission_ the special counsel is expected to resign as other independent prosecutors have done_ the sources said. In Monday's letter_ Trump's attorneys revealed that they reviewed a draft of Smith's report over the last few days at the special counsel's office and raised objections_ arguing the preparation of a report would violate federal law related to official appointments and presidential transitions. "Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action_ you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed_ then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general_ consistent with the expressed will of the People_" Trump's attorneys wrote. They also said they would seek legal recourse should Garland deny their requests. Should Garland opt to hand over the report to Trump's incoming Justice Department for consideration_ as the letter suggested_ much of the decision-making could fall to the president-elect's current defense team who will hold key leadership positions within the department_ and his selection for attorney general_ former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Justice Department declined to comment. The letter to the attorney general was included as an exhibit in a simultaneous effort by Trump's former codefendants in the classified documents case to ask a court to intervene and stop the release of the special counsel's report. Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira asked Judge Aileen Cannon to stop the release of the report_ arguing they would "suffer harm as civilian casualties" to the case. The pair were charged alongside Trump as part of an alleged effort to obstruct the classified documents probe. Both men pleaded not guilty and in Monday's letter accused Smith of improper motivations. While Smith dropped his appeal of the case against Trump citing Justice Department policy_ he opted to keep going with the appeal in Nauta and de Oliveira's case in an effort to reverse the legal precedent created by Cannon's ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed. On Monday_ attorneys for the men turned to Cannon_ urging her to step in and stop the special counsel from completing his report. They alleged such a move would be improper after the judge had previously dismissed the case. They also contended any public release could affect the ongoing appeal and infringe on the defendants' rights. "The Final Report is meant to serve as a Government verdict against the Defendants contrary to all criminal justice norms and constitutional guideposts_" the attorneys wrote. "The filing of such a report_ by an unauthorized person_ is clearly improper in this context and will cause grave harm given the pendency of criminal proceedings_ now on appeal_ at counsel Smith's own insistence." A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment. The news comes days after a top lieutenant to the special counsel_ Jay Bratt_ retired from the Justice Department.

They are signing running back Ezekiel Elliott to their practice squad_ according to FOX Sports NFL insider Jordan Schultz. Before the final week of the regular season_ the Dallas Cowboys waived Elliott at his request.

279140036,“Our hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole_ Brian Matusz_” the Orioles said in a statement. “A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016_ Brian was beloved throughout Birdland_ and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could_ was a cherished teammate_ and always had a smile on his face. Brian’s family and loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.”  Matusz turned in his best season in 2014 when he had a 3.48 ERA and 53 strikeouts. He was traded to the Atlanta Braves in 2016_ and they designated him for assignment shortly thereafter. That led him to Chicago_ where he transitioned back to a starting role and made a spot start in July 2016 – his lone appearance. That proved to be the last game of his career_ and even though he only played in one game with the Cubs_ he still got a World Series ring when they ended their 108-year drought.  Before he arrived in Baltimore_ Matusz was selected by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2005 MLB Draft_ but he opted to go to college. He starred at the University of San Diego_ where he was a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award twice as he became the program’s all-time leader in strikeouts. He ended his career by winning the West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year award in 2008.

With a bit of luck I'll be able to say the same tomorrow too.  Today's Wordle hint  Wordle today: A hint for Wednesday_ January 8  A rough sketch shown to a client before the finished art is agreed on or a quickly typed essay to give a broad idea of the finished piece could be called this. Also a chilly breeze blowing through a room in US English.   Is there a double letter in Wordle today?   No_ there is not a double letter in today's puzzle.   Wordle help: 3 tips for beating Wordle every day   Playing Wordle well is like achieving a small victory every day—who doesn't like a well-earned winning streak in a game you enjoy? If you're new to the daily word game_ or just want a refresher_ I'm going to share a few quick tips to help set you on the path to success:   You want a balanced mix of unique consonants and vowels in your opening word. A solid second guess helps to narrow down the pool of letters quickly.The answer could contain letters more than once.  There's no time pressure beyond making sure it's done by the end of the day. If you're struggling to find the answer or a tactical word for your next guess_ there's no harm in coming back to it later on.   Today's Wordle answer  What is today's Wordle answer?  Need a little help? The answer to the January 8 (1299) Wordle is DRAFT.  Previous Wordle answers  The last 10 Wordle answers   Knowing previous Wordle solutions can be helpful in eliminating current possibilities. It's unlikely a word will be repeated and you can find inspiration for guesses or starting words that may be eluding you.   Here are some recent Wordle answers:  January 7: ATLASJanuary 6: SPRIGJanuary 5: CYBERJanuary 4: RELAXJanuary 3: CHEAPJanuary 2: CHOSEJanuary 1: NERVEDecember 31: LEMURDecember 30: STAREDecember 29: MAMBO  Learn more about Wordle   Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day_ and it's your job to work out which five-letter word is hiding by eliminating or confirming the letters it contains.  Starting with a strong word like LEASH—something containing multiple vowels_ common consonants_ and no repeat letters—is a good place to start. Once you hit Enter_ the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️_ it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word_ but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.  Your second go should compliment the starting word_ using another "good" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that_ it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).   If you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips_ and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used_ you can scroll to the relevant section above.  Originally_ Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle_ as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family_ and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle_ refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

Bush_ Barack Obama and Donald Trump -- are expected to join around 3_000 mourners at the service_ and Thursday has been designated a national day of mourning_ with federal offices closed.Carter_ who served a single term before a crushing election loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980_ was perceived as naive and weak in the dog-eat-dog world of Washington politic.A more nuanced image of him has emerged as the years passed_ reassessing achievements like the brokering of a peace deal between Israel and Egypt.He also received high praise for his post-presidential humanitarian efforts_ and a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.The first president to reach triple digits_ he had been in hospice care since February 2023 in his hometown of Plains_ Georgia_ where he died and will be buried next to his late wife_ former first lady Rosalynn Carter.Mourners begun paying their respects on Saturday_ as the carefully choreographed six-day farewell got underway with US flags flying at half-staff around the country.A black hearse bearing Carter's remains paused at his boyhood family peanut farm in Plains_ where a bell was rung 39 times and staff stood in silent tribute.Crowds gathered along the roadside to say their goodbyes_ snap photographs or salute as the motorcade rolled slowly past.Carter's flag-draped casket arrived at Washington's snow-covered US Capitol on Tuesday atop a gun carriage.It was accompanied by hundreds of service members_ with military pallbearers carrying Carter to the Rotunda to lie in state ahead of Thursday's ceremony -- the first presidential funeral since Bush Senior died in 2018.Chuck Schumer_ the leader of the Democrats in the Senate_ described Carter as "one of the most decent and humble public servants we have ever seen." "President Carter was a living embodiment of leadership through service_ compassion_ and a thirst for justice for all_" he said.
279575378,I used to hate Jimmy Carter more than anything else in this world.    Let me explain.   It’s November 1979 in Oak Harbor_ Washington_ and I’m counting days. 24_ 23_ 22. I’m in the eighth grade. After school_ I fold and then deliver the Seattle Times on Whidbey Island_ the second largest island in the continental United States as our teachers like to remind us. I am counting days until I fly from Seattle to Honolulu to meet my dad_ Commander Peter Rodrick_ and ride back to San Diego with him on the USS Kitty Hawk.   The voyage will take six days_ longer than I’ve ever spent alone with him. Finally_ there will be time. I can come clean about faking sick so I could watch the Red Sox-Yankees one-game playoff last October. The Sox are Dad’s team. He’ll understand. Finally_ I can learn what my father does. I know he flies jets off carriers_ but how? Finally_ I can ask him why things seem so hard all the time.   He is counting days_ too_ his letters to mom always mark the days left of his six-month deployment as skipper of VAQ-135_ The Black Ravens. He asks her to hold on a little longer_ she’s taking care of me and my two sisters alone and I can be a pain in the ass. (“I know Steve is probably getting excited and driving you crazy but 10 December will be here soon and you’ll have some peace and quiet.”)   I’m a nerd who can’t hit a baseball_ but I can tell you the Electoral College breakdown of the 1976 Carter-Ford election. I read the paper closely as I fold and rubber band them into my carrier bag. I begin to see photographs on the front page of American hostages in Tehran_ blindfolded and terrified. But I don’t connect all the dots. At school_ I spend my newspaper money on five ice cream sandwiches for lunch and taunt David Tapia about how I’m heading to Hawaii and he’s not. I turn thirteen and receive a note from Dad: “Happy 13th_ Welcome To Being A Teenager — Yuck!”    The Kitty Hawk is just running out the clock. The carrier is in Subic Bay in the Philippines where ordinance is loaded off and empty ammunition stores are filled with recently purchased stereo equipment_ wooden plates for the wives_ and black-market Adidas bags for the kids. Dad writes a letter on the back of a Naval Air Station Cubi Point menu — “I’m broke–” giving Mom advice about welcome home parties for the squadron.   And then_ it all changes. I’m cuddled up in bed with some purloined Chip Ahoy cookies_ listening to Larry King’s overnight radio show when Mom walks into my room. She is crying.   “Dad needs to talk to you.”   I’m half asleep and he is shouting through a bad connection from the Officers Club bar at Cubi Point. All I get out of the conversation is the trip is off. He won’t be home any time soon. On The Kitty Hawk_ the stereo equipment is thrown overboard and the bombs are reloaded.   I read more the next day. President Jimmy Carter has ordered the Kitty Hawk to head for the Straits of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. The Midway is already there. Carter and the Joint Chiefs believe that two carriers camped off the Iranian coast might persuade Ayatollah Khomeini to let the hostages go or at least convince him there will be a stiff price to pay if they come to harm.   Things go back to a dreary level of normal. A week passes and we spend Thanksgiving with other families at the Navy mess on base. On November 28_ my classmates and I take a short bus ride to the Roller Barn where the other kids make fun of me for not being able to skate backwards. And then my teacher taps me on the shoulder and points toward the lobby. There_ my dad’s best friend sits in his dress uniform. He pats me on the knee.“Your dad has been in an accident.”   I return home and there is a black sedan outside our house. A few hours later_ we get the official news: My father and three fellow aviators have been killed when their EA-6B Prowler crashes into the Indian Ocean near Diego Garcia on a low-level training mission meant to simulate an attack on Tehran.   Dad is 36.    And I blame it all on Jimmy Carter.   I KNOW IT isn’t rational_ but I base it on some facts. Not only did Carter send my father into harm’s way_ but on October 29_ 1979_ he allowed the despotic and deposed Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment. That is the immediate cause for Iranian students_ at Khomeini’s behest_ to storm the embassy and take the hostages a week later.   And I know my dad and his fellow pilots didn’t like the man_ even though he went to the Naval Academy just like many of them. I remember them sitting around our house the summer before drinking Coors and declaring his presidency a disaster. They see Carter as something of a joke and cringe when he delivers a speech saying a malaise and a crisis of confidence has spread across the country they were sworn to defend. Carter is the first Democratic president after the Vietnam debacle and they see the Georgian_ a former submarine officer_ as weak_ not willing to defend America’s interests overseas with force. (The irony that it was the previously unseen military muscle of Carter and his hawkish Middle East policy that led to my father’s death won’t hit me until much later.)   I wish I could say the feeling passes after a mourning period_ but it does not. I dance around like a mad man in an end zone celebration when Carter loses to Ronald Reagan the next year. By then_ we have moved to Flint_ Michigan_ to be closer to family. I attend Catholic high school_ because that’s what Dad would have wanted. At school_ I form with another kid_ whose estranged father happens to also be a Navy pilot_ the Conservative Liberation Organization_ a cringy ad hoc of weirdo kids — Stephen Miller definitely would have joined — intent on stamping out the Democratic Party and its commie liberal policies. I am the one kid in class who will write a full defense of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative for the school paper. Occasionally_ Carter appears on our television. I curse and ball my fists together in rage.   The phase does not pass quickly. I go away to college and mock students who are protesting student aid cuts as Reagan jacks up the military budget. I sneer and shout at them_ “We all have to make sacrifices for our country.”   I go into therapy and_ sure_ it’s a lot about Mom and the loss of my dad_ but Carter comes up a lot. He is the one who ruined my life_ he is the one who caused Mom to be left alone and broken. The therapist tries to reason with me_ but I do not hear.   Then something happens_ not connected to my father or Carter. I move to Chicago and I see the poverty in the rows and rows of high-rise public housing tenements lining the South Side. And I remember thinking that my father would have wept at all of this urban despair. And I remember that_ yes_ he was a hot-shot Navy pilot_ but he also was a man of God who went to Mass every day. After his crash_ the priest on the Kitty Hawk writes to my mother to say that somehow_ despite his 100-hour weeks doing the job he worked all his life to attain_ he also found time to counsel sailors in crisis on the ship.   My heart begins to unfreeze.    Somewhere_ I catch a TV news story of Carter building a house for the less fortunate with his wife_ Rosalynn. And I see in their relationship a reflection of my parents’ marriage_ a love that could survive crisis_ separation_ and even death. I learn that Carter is devout_ a Baptist like my mother_ and teaches Sunday School_ something my father wanted to do once he left the Navy. And then I talk with my mother. “I don’t blame Carter_” she tells me. “Your dad knew the risks; he knew this could happen. He wouldn’t want you to hate him.”   I AM A REPORTER and it is not impossible that my paths could crossed with Carter at some point. In fact_ I write a book about my father and Navy pilots and initially want to talk with Carter about the burden of sending Americans into harm’s way. Eventually_ I embed with my father’s old squadron and deploy with them. I even get up in a Prowler_ my dad’s old plane_ and fly over Whidbey and look down on my old paper route. My son is born on November 28_ 2013_ 34 years to the day after my dad’s crash. I name him after his grandfather. But I never reach out to Carter.    Why? I think I knew I would have broken down in the kind old man’s arms. I would have said I was sorry for hating him. And that I forgave him for simply fulfilling the hardest part of a president’s job. And I know he would have said he understood. Maybe he would have shed a tear of his own. But I never did it. I guess I am doing it now. President Carter_ rest in peace.

279512608,Penn State faces Notre in the Orange Bowl in the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs on Thursday_ Jan. 9_ 2024 (1/9/25) at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami_ Florida.  How to watch: Fans can watch the game for free via a trial of DirecTV Stream or fuboTV. You can also watch via a subscription to Sling TV_ which is offering half off your first month.  Here’s what you need to know:  What: Orange Bowl  Who: Penn State vs. Notre Dame  When: Thursday_ Jan. 9_ 2025  Where: Hard Rock Stadium (Miami_ Florida)  Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Live stream: DirecTV Stream or fuboTV  DANIA BEACH_ Fla. (AP) — It’s been a long time since either Notre Dame or Penn State reached college football’s mountaintop as national champions. It was 1988 for the Fighting Irish_ 1986 for the Nittany Lions. There’s been good seasons and bad seasons in the three-plus decades that have followed_ coaching changes and a complete overhaul of what the sport looks like.  Yet here they are — back again_ on the doorstep of a title shot.  The loss to Northern Illinois is no longer relevant to Notre Dame. The losses to Ohio State and Oregon don’t matter to Penn State right now. The Irish (13-1) and Nittany Lions (13-2) face off in the Orange Bowl on Thursday night_ the first of two College Football Playoff semifinal games; the other is Friday when Texas takes on Ohio State.  “Obviously_ you don’t get to this point in the season without being good in all three phases_” Penn State coach James Franklin said. “So far_ got a ton of respect for what we’ve seen on film and what we’ve studied_ and we’ve got a lot of work to do.”  Notre Dame has won 12 straight games_ its longest streak since a 16-game run spanning the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Its lone loss was a Week 2 defeat at home_ 16-14 to Northern Illinois. In the old days of college football — maybe as recently as last year_ even — such a loss could have doomed playoff chances. Not anymore.  Notre Dame got here by topping Georgia in the CFP quarterfinals at the Sugar Bowl_ a game that was delayed one day because of the truck attack in New Orleans. Penn State got its semifinal slot by topping Boise State at the Fiesta Bowl two days earlier.  “The mental preparation time has been the same_” Irish coach Marcus Freeman said. “For us_ it was just a normal week. It was a Saturday to a Saturday_ as we look at it in terms of game week. I think the coaches_ we probably were a little bit behind to start just because of the travel and in that aspect_ but physically our guys were good. Our guys were good_ and we’re going to be ready to roll.”  A historic matchup for Black coaches  It has been a storyline since the matchup was set: The winning coach in this game will go to the CFP title game on Jan. 20 with a chance of becoming the first Black coach to win a major college football national championship.  “I don’t take it lightly_” Franklin said.  Freeman made sure to give credit to the two people who hired him at Notre Dame: then-athletic director Jack Swarbrick and then-university president the Rev. John Jenkins.  “I want to make sure I recognize them_” Freeman said. “And again_ this isn’t about me. This isn’t about one person. It takes a team. It takes a program. It takes a lot of people committing to something bigger than themselves to put your team in a position to be here_ and I understand it_ and I’m very grateful for it. If this creates more opportunities for other coaches_ other minority coaches_ great. It’s great. It is great for the future generations of coaches_ of college football coaches_ of leaders. I am all for it_ and I’m grateful to be a part of that.”  It’s the 20th meeting between the programs. They split the first 19_ going 9-9-1_ and haven’t met since Sept. 8_ 2007.  The schools met annually from 1981 through 1992 when both were independents; Penn State joined the Big Ten starting with the 1993 season. Thursday’s game will be just the third meeting since.  Defense reigns  All four of the CFP semifinalists have stout defenses.  Ohio State ranks No. 1 nationally in yards allowed per game this season_ Texas is No. 3_ Penn State is No. 6 and Notre Dame is No. 8.  Notre Dame in NFL stadiums  Here’s good news for Notre Dame: It has won its last six games played in NFL stadiums. Hard Rock Stadium_ the site of the Orange Bowl_ is home to the Miami Dolphins.  Here’s bad news for Notre Dame: Hard Rock has not been fun for the Irish. They’re 0-2 in that stadium_ losing 42-14 to Alabama in the BCS championship game that capped the 2012 season and losing 41-8 to the Miami Hurricanes in 2017.  An intimate gathering  Attendance will be about 65_000 on Thursday night. For Penn State_ that’s a small crowd.  Bolstered by having a home stadium that routinely draws crowds exceeding 100_000_ the Nittany Lions will see their total attendance for the season approach the 1.4 million mark at the Orange Bowl.  It will extend Penn State’s single-season program record. The Nittany Lions drew 1_247_707 in 2002.  Thank you for supporting journalism you can trust.

279570014,ALBANY_ N.Y. — New York’s highest court declined to block Donald Trump’s upcoming sentencing in his hush money case Thursday_ leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as the president-elect’s likely last option to prevent the hearing from taking place Friday.  One judge of the New York Court of Appeals issued a brief order declining to grant a hearing to Trump’s legal team.  Trump has asked the Supreme Court to call off Friday’s sentencing in the hush money case.   His lawyers turned to the nation’s highest court on Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Judge Juan M. Merchan_ who presided over Trump’s trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.   Trump has denied wrongdoing.

Google has donated to inaugurals in the past_ and the YouTube livestream and link to the inauguration on Google’s homepage are in line with previous inaugurations_ a spokesperson said.  Trump has had a rocky relationship with major tech companies over the years_ and he has not shied away from criticism of the sector following the election. He signaled late last year that he wouldn’t rule out antitrust enforcement_ which is a particularly sore spot for Google.  A federal U.S. judge ruled in August that the company has illegally held a monopoly in search and text advertising. Arguments in a second antitrust case about Google’s advertising business closed in November_ though a verdict has not yet been announced.  “Big Tech has run wild for years_ stifling competition in our most innovative sector and_ as we all know_ using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans_ as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump wrote in a Dec. 4 post on Truth Social.   Google CEO Sundar Pichai and former Alphabet President Sergey Brin met with Trump after the election_ and Pichai publicly congratulated the president-elect on his “decisive victory” in a post on X.  — CNBC’s Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report

279752536,The reasons to ban TikTok are plentiful_ which is why overwhelming bipartisan majorities passed legislation last year to force owner ByteDance’s divestiture from the app or face a ban in the U.S. by Jan. 19. There are obvious national security risks to keeping TikTok around_ which are outlined in a recent Advancing American Freedom amicus brief urging the court to uphold the ban. But perhaps even more sinister are TikTok’s harmful effects on children’s well-being.  For as long as it has existed_ Chinese-controlled TikTok has insidiously exposed children and teenagers to the very worst sort of material: online content promoting suicide_ extreme diets_ distorted body images_ and corrupt ideologies. A 2022 Center for Countering Digital Hate study found that TikTok accounts registered as 13-year-olds witnessed suicidal content within mere minutes of setting up their accounts. The CCDH report also found that TikTok recommended videos about body image and mental health every 39 seconds_ using ads for medical procedures and weight-loss drinks as a means to undermine teens’ perception of their self-worth and body image. In total_ research by Eko found that suicide-related content on TikTok has generated over 1.43 million posts and 8.8 billion views since the app’s launch.  The real-life consequences of TikTok must not be taken lightly. Teens_ including 14-year-old Andie Duke_ who developed an eating disorder from exposure to TikTok’s harmful dieting video reels_ are being done a massive disservice by the platform’s recommendation loop. Duke noticed that “the more [she] interacted with those types of videos_ the more they started to show up.” She spent hours watching videos focused on calorie counting_ excessive exercise_ curbing hunger_ and ways to hide what she was doing from parents. Likewise_ TikTok user Daisy Gonzalez lost nearly 100 pounds in one year due to seeing so much dieting content on the platform_ causing her to develop gallstones and have her gallbladder removed.   The physical and mental anguish inflicted by TikTok extends far beyond dieting and suicide by telling children that they should question their biological sex and take steps to change it_ surgically and hormonally. The app aggressively pushes gender and sexuality content to minors_ even giving transgender influencers the ability to distribute puberty blockers and hormones to youth_ all without parental consent. Some users even say TikTok’s algorithm identified their bisexuality before they did.   One such victim of TikTok’s push for gender confusion who has since detransitioned_ Oli London_ has spoken out about the inner turmoil he experienced after engaging with the app. He explains that the app heavily promotes double mastectomies to women and girls using the hashtag #topsurgery_ which gained more than 2.1 billion views in 2023.  Parents should be terrified by just how pervasive TikTok’s influence is over the inner lives of their children and throughout our culture. In fact_ TikTok is the most popular social media platform among children in the United States and globally. Tragically_ 41% of American children spent more than two hours a day on the app in 2023_ allowing TikTok to acquire $2 billion in ad revenue from its users aged 13 to 17.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  The good news is that parents and policymakers are waking up to these horrifying realities. In April 2024_ 352 House members and 79 senators voted to block the Chinese-owned app from warping the minds and souls of our youth with destructive content. We all must continue to ensure that our lawmakers reinforce the timeless truth that children are best protected by those who love them most: parents and guardians.   China is attempting to harm the mental and physical health of American youth through TikTok’s dangerous algorithm. If TikTok is to continue to be available in app stores in the United States_ it must be sold to a U.S. company free from toxic Chinese propaganda or else banned from use. The health and safety of our posterity depend on it.  Paul Teller is the executive vice president of Advancing American Freedom.

279678866,Washington — A federal appeals court in Atlanta on Thursday rejected a bid to block the release of a portion of special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigation and prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump stemming from an alleged plan to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied the request from Walt Nauta_ an aide to Trump_ and Carlos de Oliveira_ the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago_ who were charged for their role in allegedly obstructing a separate federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records. The 11th Circuit granted Smith's request to drop Trump from the case in late November after he was elected to a second term in the White House because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But federal prosecutors are moving forward with the appeal of a lower court decision dismissing the charges against Nauta and de Oliveira on the grounds Smith was unconstitutionally appointed.Smith submitted a two-volume final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday evening that detailed his investigations into Trump. The first volume relates to the prosecution stemming from the 2020 election_ and the second volume pertains to the president-elect's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office in 2020.Garland has pledged to disclose to the public all special counsel reports completed while he was attorney general_ and has so far followed through on that pledge_ including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified.But lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira earlier this week sought to stop Smith's report from being made public_ arguing it would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon_ who oversaw the documents case_ to block the Justice Department from releasing the report. Separately_ the president-elect's lawyers urged Garland in a letter to remove Smith from his post as special counsel and stop the preparation and dissemination of his report.Cannon on Tuesday agreed to temporarily block the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolves the matter_ leaving it to the appeals court to decide whether Smith's work should be made public. Her order remains in effect for another three days_ though the appeals court said if the Justice Department would like to seek relief_ it could file a notice of appeal.In filings with the 11th Circuit_ the Justice Department asked the court to deny Nauta and de Oliveira's bid to keep the report shielded from the public_ but said Garland would not release the portion that deals with the classified documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing.Prosecutors said the attorney general does plan to disclose to Congress and the American people the first volume of Smith's report involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume about the documents case available for review only by the top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees_ and only if they agreed not to share information from it."This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests_" prosecutors wrote.Garland on Wednesday informed the top Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committees that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume "in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter_" but would not release the second volume "to avoid any risk of prejudice" to Nauta and de Oliveira.In their own filing with the 11th Circuit_ defense lawyers urged the court to send the dispute back to Cannon's court for a hearing and_ in the meantime_ prevent Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report."A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial_" they wrote.Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit_ his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to block the release of Smith's report.The report_ they claimed_ is "nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power."
279727246,By MICHAEL R. SISAK_ JENNIFER PELTZ and JAKE OFFENHARTZ_ Associated Press  NEW YORK (AP) — In a singular moment in U.S. history_ President-elect Donald Trump faces sentencing Friday for his New York hush money conviction after the nation’s highest court refused to intervene.  Like so much else in the criminal case and the current American political landscape_ the scenario set to unfold in an austere Manhattan courtroom was unimaginable only a few years ago. A state judge is to say what consequences_ if any_ the country’s former and soon-to-be leader will face for felonies that a jury found he committed.  With Trump 10 days from inauguration_ Judge Juan M. Merchan has indicated he plans a no-penalty sentence called an unconditional discharge and prosecutors aren’t opposing it. That would mean no jail time_ no probation and no fines would be imposed_ but nothing is final until Friday’s proceeding is done.  Regardless of the outcome_ Trump will become the first person convicted of a felony to assume the presidency.  Trump_ who is expected to appear by video from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida_ will have the opportunity to speak. He has pilloried the case_ the only one of his four criminal indictments that has gone to trial and possibly the only one that ever will.  The judge has indicated that he plans the unconditional discharge — a rarity in felony convictions — partly to avoid complicated constitutional issues that would arise if he imposed a penalty that overlapped with Trump’s presidency.  The hush money case accused him of fudging his business’ records to veil a $130_000 payoff to porn actor Stormy Daniels. She was paid_ late in Trump’s 2016 campaign_ not to tell the public about a sexual encounter she maintains the two had a decade earlier. He says nothing sexual happened between them_ and he contends that his political adversaries spun up a bogus prosecution to try to damage him.  “I never falsified business records. It is a fake_ made up charge_” the Republican president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform last week. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg_ whose office brought the charges_ is a Democrat.  Bragg’s office said in a court filing Monday that Trump committed “serious offenses that caused extensive harm to the sanctity of the electoral process and to the integrity of New York’s financial marketplace.”  While the specific charges were about checks and ledgers_ the underlying accusations were seamy and deeply entangled with Trump’s political rise. Prosecutors said Daniels was paid off — through Trump’s personal attorney at the time_ Michael Cohen — as part of a wider effort to keep voters from hearing about Trump’s alleged extramarital escapades.  Trump denies the alleged encounters occurred. His lawyers said he wanted to squelch the stories to protect his family_ not his campaign. And while prosecutors said Cohen’s reimbursements for paying Daniels were deceptively logged as legal expenses_ Trump says that’s simply what they were.  “There was nothing else it could have been called_” he wrote on Truth Social last week_ adding_ “I was hiding nothing.”  Trump’s lawyers tried unsuccessfully to forestall a trial. Since his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records_ they have pulled virtually every legal lever within reach to try to get the conviction overturned_ the case dismissed or at least the sentencing postponed.  They have made various arguments to Merchan_ New York appeals judges_ and federal courts including the Supreme Court. The Trump attorneys have leaned heavily into assertions of presidential immunity from prosecution_ and they got a boost in July from a Supreme Court decision that affords former commanders-in-chief considerable immunity.  Trump was a private citizen and presidential candidate when Daniels was paid in 2016. He was president when the reimbursements to Cohen were made and recorded the following year.  On one hand_ Trump’s defense argued that immunity should have kept jurors from hearing some evidence_ such as testimony about some of his conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks.  And after Trump won this past November’s election_ his lawyers argued that the case had to be scrapped to avoid impinging on his upcoming presidency and his transition to the Oval Office.  Merchan_ a Democrat_ repeatedly postponed the sentencing_ initially set for July. But last week_ he set Friday’s date_ citing a need for “finality.” He wrote that he strove to balance Trump’s need to govern_ the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling_ the respect due a jury verdict and the public’s expectation that “no one is above the law.”  Trump’s lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to block the sentencing. Their last hope vanished Thursday night with a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that declined to delay the sentencing.  Meanwhile_ the other criminal cases that once loomed over Trump have ended or stalled ahead of trial.  After Trump’s election_ special counsel Jack Smith closed out the federal prosecutions over Trump’s handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. A state-level Georgia election interference case is locked in uncertainty after prosecutorFaniWillis was removed from it.

279926254,KYIV_ Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s forces have captured two North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian troops in Russia’s Kursk border region_ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday.   He made the comments days after Ukraine began pressing new attacks in Kursk to retain ground captured in a lightning incursion in August that resulted in the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II.   Moscow’s counterattack has left Ukrainian forces outstretched and demoralized_ killing and wounding thousands and retaking more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk Ukraine had seized.  “Our soldiers have captured North Korean soldiers in Kursk. These are two soldiers who_ although wounded_ survived_ were taken to Kyiv_ and are communicating” with Ukrainian security services_ Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.  He shared photos of two men resting on cots in a room with bars over the windows. Both wore bandages_ one around his jaw and the other around both hands and wrists.   Zelenskyy said capturing the soldiers alive was “not easy.” He asserted that Russian and North Korean forces fighting in Kursk have tried to conceal the presence of North Korean soldiers_ including by killing wounded comrades on the battlefield to avoid their capture and interrogation by Kyiv.  Ukraine’s security service SBU on Saturday provided more information on the two soldiers. In a statement_ it said one had no documents at all_ while the other had been carrying a Russian military ID card in the name of a man from Tuva_ a Russian region bordering Mongolia.   “The prisoners do not speak Ukrainian_ English or Russian_ so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence_” the statement said.   According to the SBU_ one of the soldiers claimed he had been told he was going to Russia for training_ rather than to fight against Ukraine.   The agency said both men were provided with medical care in line with the Geneva Conventions_ and are being investigated “in cooperation with South Korean intelligence.”  A senior Ukrainian military official said last month that a couple hundred North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk have been killed or wounded in battle.  The official was providing the first significant estimate of North Korean casualties_ which came several weeks after Ukraine announced that Pyongyang had sent 10_000 to 12_000 troops to Russia to help it in its almost 3-year war against its much smaller neighbor.  The White House and Pentagon last month confirmed that the North Korean forces have been battling on the front lines in largely infantry positions. They have been fighting with Russian units and_ in some cases_ independently around Kursk.  Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine
279874178,Sam Moore_ one-half of the Sam & Dave duo_ died on Friday_ Jan. 10. He was 89.   The celebrated R&B singer died after surgery in Coral Gables_ Fla._ his wife and longtime manager_ Joyce Moor_ confirmed to The New York Times.   Moore was born in Miami on Oct. 12_ 1935. He started professional singing in the late 1950s when he met his future partner_ Dave Prater. By 1961_ they met again at the King of Hearts club in Miami and soon began performing together as a music group. By 1964_ Atlantic Records watched the two perform and then offered them a contract.   Throughout the 1960s_ they hit their stride_ and the pair released R&B hits_ including “Hold On_ I’m Comin_’ ” “I Thank You_” and “Soul Man.” The latter topped the charts and hit No. 2 on the pop charts in 1967. The track also won a Grammy for best rhythm & blues group performance_ vocal or instrumental.   The two split in 1970 and Moore recorded a solo album_ Plenty Good Lovin’_ which was released in 2002.   Throughout their careers_ they would break up and reunite several times when their solo careers did not reach the success they wanted.   "It was a duo_” Moore said in the 1998 book Sam and Dave: An Oral History. “But it wasn’t a partnership.”   The pair performed together for the final time on New Year’s Eve 1981 in San Francisco_ and once they left the stage_ they never spoke again_ per The New York Times. Around the same time_ they both struggled with a heroin addiction. After meeting Joyce McRae_ she eventually became his manager and urged him to participate in trials for anti-opiate treatments. By 1983_ he went public with his addiction and volunteered with people struggling with the same issue.   During his solo career_ Moore toured with several performers_ including Bruce Springsteen. Meanwhile_ Prater recruited a new partner_ Sam Daniels_ and they worked together and called themselves Sam & Dave_ despite Moore’s objections. The original duo were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Six years later_ Prater died in a fatal car accident.   In 2019_ the duo received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2019.   Moore is survived by his wife_ Joyce_ their daughter Michelle_ and grandchildren Tash_ and Misha.
279862184,Sam Moore_ who helped bring the sound of the church to pop music with a string of call-and-response hits as the high tenor in the Stax Records duo Sam & Dave with partner Dave Prater_ has died. He was 89.   Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables_ Florida_ of complications recovering from surgery_ his rep Jeremy Westby announced.   Called “the greatest of all soul duos” by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame_ which inducted the pair in 1992_ Sam & Dave worked with the songwriting/production team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter_ using Booker T & the M.G.’s and the Memphis Horns as their backing band_ to produce a string of indelible rave-up hits from 1965-68.   The combination of talent produced such fevered back-and-forth exchanges as “You Don’t Know Like I Know_” “Hold On_ I’m Coming_” “You Got Me Hummin’_” “Soul Man” and “I Thank You.”   Along with labelmate Otis Redding_ Sam & Dave were show-stopping live performers_ electrifying the Stax revues of the mid-1960s and fueling Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi to create their own Ray Ban-wearing homage as The Blues Brothers.   Born on Oct. 12_ 1935_ in Miami — where he first met his soon-to-be-sidekick in 1961 — Samuel David Moore was a church-reared singer who performed with such gospel quarters as The Gales and The Millionaires and once reportedly turned down an offer to replace a departing Sam Cooke in The Soul Stirrers. Moore and Prater_ who was also an experienced gospel singer_ crossed paths at Miami’s The King of Hearts club_ where they were discovered by producer Henry Stone_ who signed them to Roulette Records.    Experiencing only minor success at Roulette_ the duo’s career began to take off after they were signed by Atlantic Records’ Jerry Wexler in 1964_ then “loaned” out to Stax to produce_ record and release their records.   The pair’s November 1965 single_ “You Don’t Know Like I Know_” launched a series of 10 straight Top 20 Billboard R&B classics_ including “Hold On_ I’m Coming” (’66)_ “You Got Me Hummin’” (’66)_ “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby” (’67)_ “Soul Man” (’67) and “I Thank You” (’68)_ a majority of them written by Hayes and Porter.   The two_ who were often at odds_ broke up in 1970 with the end of their relationship with Stax. Sam & Dave’s off-and-on relationship continued until 1981_ enjoying a resurgence in popularity with The Blues Brothers’ cover of “Soul Man” in 1979. The pair’s last performance together was New Year’s Eve 1981 at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. Prater died in a car crash on April 9_ 1988.   Moore launched his own solo career after breaking up with Prater the first time in 1970_ recording several singles for an album with Atlantic that weren’t released for more than 30 years after the murder of the record’s producer_ King Curtis.   Moore toured with other soul artists_ including Wilson Pickett in spring 1982 in Europe_ where he married Joyce McRae_ who helped him overcome a lengthy drug addiction. Moore not only went public with his addiction in 1983_ he became a strong anti-drug advocate and worked as a volunteer for various anti-drug programs. His wife remained his business manager until his death_ working with him to advocate artist’s rights_ royalties and pension payments.   Moore found his opportunities as a solo performer apart from Prater waning_ and at one point was forced to sue Prater to prevent him from touring as Sam & Dave with another singer_ Sam Daniels. Moore eventually formed an organization_ Artists and Others Against Imposters_ to prevent groups from deceiving the public by going out without their original members_ testifying before Congress in 1989.   Moore performed on Don Henley’s Building the Perfect Beast album in 1984 on the song “You’re Not Drinking Enough” and two years later rerecorded “Soul Man” with Lou Reed for the film of the same name_ reaching No. 30 on the U.K. singles chart. In 1988_ he joined the Elwood Blues Revue_ featuring Dan Aykroyd and The Blues Brothers band.   Moore appeared in Monkee Michael Nesmith’s 1988 film spoof_ Tapeheads_ with Junior Walker as the “legendary” soul duo_ The Swanky Modes. They later performed “Ordinary Ma_ from the movie together on Late Night With David Letterman. The pairing represented a rare joining of artists from both the Stax and Motown labels.

The Buckeyes (13-2) got the semifinal victory in the same stadium where 10 years ago they were champions in the debut of the College Football Playoff as a four-team format. Now they have the opportunity to be the winner again in the debut of the expanded 12-team field. Ohio State plays Orange Bowl champion Notre Dame in Atlanta on Jan. 20 Sawyer got to Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers on a fourth-and-goal from the 8_ knocking the ball loose and scooping it up before lumbering all the way to the other end. It was the longest fumble return in CFP history. Ewers and Sawyer were roommates in Columbus for the one semester the quarterback was there before transferring home to Texas_ and helping lead the Longhorns (13-3) to consecutive CFP semifinals. But next season will be their 20th since winning their last national title with Vince Young in 2005.

Watch the NFL Playoffs on FuboTV (7-day free trial) and Paramount+  #5 Los Angeles Chargers vs. #4 Houston Texans  When: Saturday_ January 11Time: 4:30 p.m. ETWhere: NRG Stadium (Houston_ Texas)Channel: CBSStream: FuboTV (Free Trial)_ DirecTV Stream_ Sling_ Paramount+  Both teams are coming into the postseason on various swings of momentum.  The Texans clinched the AFC South title almost by default. Thanks to lackluster division that saw only Houston finish with a winning record_ the Texans were able to at least secure the four seed in the AFC with a 10-7 record. The team looked impressive early on this year_ but a couple of tough losses left fans to wonder how far this team can go. Disappointing defeats at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens placed some doubts around the team_ despite beating the Tennessee Titans in the final game of the regular season.  Houston made it to the divisional round last year before losing to the Ravens.  The Chargers are back in the playoffs after missing out last year. Under Jim Harbaugh_ confidence on both sides of the ball was noticeable throughout the season. After a bumpy start_ L.A. started to pick up wins and play some impressive games. Even though they lost to the likes of the Ravens and Chiefs_ they showed they can hang with the best teams in the NFL_ finishing second in the AFC West with an 11-6 record.  The Chargers are trying to win their first playoff game in five years.  L.A. is 6-3 in nine meetings with Houston.  MY PICK: Chargers win_ 24-20  Watch the NFL Playoffs on FuboTV (7-day free trial)

Blue and Purple defeated me. Games are a blindspot for me. If I enjoy a game I get locked into it for years – Tetris_ Sim City_ Balatro – playing absolutely nothing else until a new game takes over_ or as was the case with a dinner party game called RSVP I played every day on my phone_ accidentally delete and then find out it is no no longer available. I realize this is a bit odd and it’s left me completely ignorant of everything else. But even if I was aware of the video game canon of the late 20th century I would have definitely included SONIC THE HEDGEHOG as an Atari game (it’s Sega)_ instead of the THINGS FEATURING TAILS category.  After Googling “does Sonic The Hedgehog have a tail?” (I’m not the first to do this) I eventually discovered that Tails is the name of a character within the Sonic The Hedgehog universe – and yes Sonic does have a tail.

279983234,South Korea's National Intelligence Service on Sunday backed up Ukraine's account of having captured two wounded North Korean soldiers this week in Russia_ after Kyiv said they were being questioned.Ukraine_ the United States and South Korea have accused nuclear-armed North Korea of sending more than 10_000 soldiers to help bolster Russian forces.Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said in a statement it has "confirmed that the Ukrainian military captured two North Korean soldiers on January 9 in the Kursk battlefield in Russia".On Saturday_ Ukrainian intelligence (SBU) released a video showing the two men in hospital bunks_ one with bandaged hands and the other with a bandaged jaw. A doctor at the detention centre said the first man also had a broken leg.The SBU said the men had told interrogators they were experienced army soldiers_ and one said he was sent to Russia for training_ not fighting.But Kyiv did not present direct evidence that the captured men were North Korean and AFP was unable to independently verify their nationalities.South Korea's confirmation added weight to Kyiv's account.The NIS similarly said one of the captured soldiers revealed during his interrogation that he received military training from Russian forces after arriving there in November."He initially believed he was being sent for training_ realising upon arrival in Russia that he had been deployed_" the NIS said.The soldier said North Korean forces had experienced "significant losses during battle".According to Seoul's intelligence agency_ one of the men "went without food or water for 4 to 5 days before being captured".The NIS said it would continue to work with the SBU to share information on North Korean fighters in Ukraine.Neither Russia nor North Korea has reacted to the intelligence accounts.Russia and North Korea have boosted their military ties since Moscow's invasion_ though neither has confirmed that Pyongyang's forces are fighting for Moscow.Zelensky said last month that nearly 3_000 North Korean soldiers had been "killed or wounded" there_ while Seoul put the figure at 1_000.The NIS told the country's lawmakers last month that "several North Korean casualties" had already been attributed to Ukrainian missile and drone attacks as well as training accidents_ with the highest ranking "at least at the level of a general". Due to losses among its forces_ North Korea is preparing for additional deployment to Ukraine_ according to Seoul's military. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement last month that Pyongyang is reportedly "preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers" to aid Russia's war effort.Pyongyang and Moscow have deepened political_ military and cultural ties since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022_ with Putin and Kim repeatedly professing their personal closeness.In a New Year's letter_ North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed Vladimir Putin and made a possible reference to the war in Ukraine.He said 2025 would be the year "when the Russian army and people defeat neo-Nazism and achieve a great victory".

279974050,Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump_ an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead.  The department disclosed Smith’s departure in a court filing Saturday_ saying he had resigned one day earlier. The resignation_ 10 days before Trump is inaugurated _ follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump’s White House win in November.  At issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.  The Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration_ but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump’s co-defendants in that case_ Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira_ had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial_ an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.  The department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July_ a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.  But prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume.  In an emergency motion late Friday_ they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report_ but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday.  The appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report_ which covers Trump’s efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6_ 2021_ to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon’s injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.  The Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon’s order was “plainly erroneous.”  “The Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department_” the Justice Department said. “The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.”  Justice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work_ and it’s customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject.  William Barr_ attorney general during Trump’s first term_ released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.  Biden’s attorney general_ Merrick Garland_ has also released special counsel reports_ including about Biden’s handling of classified information before Biden became president.

280053834,Jan. 13 (UPI) -- Blue Origin scrubbed the launch of its new heavy-lift rocket early Monday_ once again postponing the maiden flight of its New Glenn rocket.  The two-stage reusable New Glenn launch vehicle was scheduled to lift off from Launch Complex 36 at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window that opened at 1 a.m. EST Monday.  After the window opened_ the launch was repeatedly pushed until ultimately being scrubbed.  In a statement_ Blue Origin said it was standing down the NG-1 Mission to "troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue."  "We're reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt_" it said on X.  The launch was earlier scheduled for Friday but was pushed to Sunday due to unfavorable weather in the Atlantic where the first-stage booster -- named So You're Telling Me There's A Chance -- was to be retrieved by the Jacklyn droneship.  Persistent conditions in the Atlantic again saw the launch moved to Monday. Ahead of the rescheduled attempt_ Blue Origin made no announcement regarding weather but stated the launch team was proceeding with fueling New Glenn with propellant.  As the launch window opened_ Blue Origin published a statement to its X account_ stating NG-1 Mission's goal is for their rocket to reach orbit.  "Anything beyond that is icing on the cake_" it said.  "We know landing the booster on our first try offshore in the Atlantic is ambitious -- but we're going for it. No matter what happens_ we'll learn_ refine and apply that knowledge to our next launch."  The 320-foot New Glenn orbital-class rocket -- named after John Glenn_ the first American to orbit Earth -- is set to transport to space a payload of the Blue Ring Pathfinder_ which is designed to test communications_ power and controls systems for Blue Origin's multi-use Blue Ring space platform.  According to Blue Origin_ New Glenn's first-stage booster is designed for a minimum of 25 flights. With a nearly 23-foot class payload fairing_ New Glenn boasts twice the volume of SpaceX's Falcon 9 17-foot payload fairing option.  The highly-anticipated launch will mark a significant milestone for the Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin_ which was founded in 2000 and has been working on the New Glenn rocket for more than a decade.  A successful launch would help New Glenn achieve Department of Defense certification_ positioning Blue Origin to compete for private and government contracts with SpaceX_ owned by the world's richest person Elon Musk_ which has dominated the satellite launch service industry.  Bezos_ according to Forbes_ sits at second on the world's richest list.

280162038,TOKYO -- A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit southwestern Japan_ the country's Meteorological Agency said Monday.

280140052,In many ways_ I couldn’t be happier with Dynasty Warriors Origins. The revitalization of what had become a very tired franchise is mostly a successful one_ modernizing its gameplay elements while retaining what made it so special in the first place. You just can’t get that immense ‘1 vs. 1_000’ power fantasy anywhere else_ and Dynasty Warriors Origins does it better than ever.  Rest assured that for the most part_ this is still a Dynasty Warriors game through and through. You’ll rampage across massive battlefields_ taking out key positions and removing enemy officers from play to gain the advantage - often laying waste to thousands of soldiers unlucky enough to be on your path from A to B.  But the gameplay loop has evolved in so many ways. For one_ weapon types aren’t just different ways to hit the same normal / strong attack combos in sequence_ instead offering unique mechanics that set them apart from each other. New elements like grand tactics and ambush charges also add a wonderfully cinematic feeling to battles when they happen_ ensuring that something monumentally exciting happens on almost every map.  Then there’s the story_ which has also seen a pretty major shift_ and it’s one I have mixed feelings about. The move to a sole playable protagonist is a pretty bold change on developer Omega Force’s part_ and while other officers are playable (and extremely powerful) in a limited capacity_ this’ll probably be a letdown for long-time series fans hoping to get stuck in with a returning favorite.  Return to the Three Kingdoms  As ever_ Dynasty Warriors Origins’ narrative is based on that of Luo Guanzhong’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Three distinct factions are locked in a power struggle as each attempts to unify China under one banner as the influence of the Han dynasty begins to wane.  Origins’ story presents things a little differently. While still featuring the era’s major events such as the Yellow Turban Rebellion_ Dong Zhuo’s tyrannical reign_ and the pivotal Battle of Red Cliffs_ we do it all through the eyes of an original protagonist.  This approach comes with its own set of successes and drawbacks. You’re given a lot of agency in the officers you wish to get to know better via bonding events and optional battles_ especially later in the game where you need to decide on which of the three factions you’ll join. This_ in turn_ can change the latter half of Origins greatly_ with you fighting different battles and armies based on your choices. That naturally makes for a healthy amount of replay value as you can go back and explore other routes via New Game Plus.  On the other hand_ the shift to a single playable protagonist has plenty of faults. For one_ the hero is aggressively bland. He barely registers any kind of expression during cutscenes and has no voice lines of his own outside of flavor text in battle. Plus_ his story just isn’t very interesting with an amnesiac narrative that culminates in a pretty predictable payoff.  It just ultimately doesn’t add much value to the timeless and still very engaging Three Kingdoms plot. I do feel that having the option to create your own character - like in other Koei Tecmo games such as Nioh 2_ Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty_ and Rise of the Ronin - could’ve remedied this problem to a degree. At least then_ we’d be able to apply some kind of identity to our protagonist especially as you won’t have much opportunity to play as other iconic officers - but more on that later.  Army of one  So while Dynasty Warriors Origins’ narrative changes end up feeling a little flat for me_ I won’t be saying the same for its gameplay. Origins is the best-feeling Warriors game ever made_ even when accounting for some of the excellent spin-offs like Hyrule Warriors and Dragon Quest Heroes 2. Origins boasts a level of AAA quality that the series has simply never had before_ and it brings plenty of changes and additions that help keep the experience from feeling stale.  For starters_ each of the game’s nine weapon types all feel distinct and are a far cry from the usual normal-to-strong attack combos we typically get from the series. That style is retained on the basic sword weapon type_ but I found pretty much every other weapon to be vastly more interesting.  The twin pikes_ for example_ dish out more damaging blows when your strong attack inputs are hit at the right time. Meanwhile_ the lance lets you absorb blows by holding down the strong attack button leading to a devastating attack at full strength. A favorite of mine is the gauntlets which let you adopt various stances for a wide variety of different attacks suited to both crowd control and single-target damage.  Weapon types will also rank up the more you use them_ unlocking even more moves and abilities for each. Higher ranks will in turn unlock new sets of nodes on your skill tree_ further bolstering your power when you redeem skill points earned through battle and by ticking off optional training objectives assigned to you by other officers. Furthermore_ Bravery skills and Tactics offer an even wider pool of abilities_ including powerful guard-breaking attacks and volleys of arrows to reign down on the opposing army.  There may be fewer weapon types overall when compared to older Warriors entries_ then_ but this has allowed Omega Force to really flesh out their move sets for a more fulfilling experience overall. It’s great that the game incentivizes you to try out all weapon types_ too_ via those aforementioned training objectives and evolving move sets as they rank up.  It’s not just the protagonist that can be controlled during battle_ though. You also have the ability to partner up with another iconic officer as a companion. When their meter is full_ you’re able to temporarily switch to them. These officers_ including series favorites like Xiahou Dun_ Guan Yu_ and Sun Shangxiang_ are deliberately overpowered and are able to turn the tides of a battle in an instant.  Companion officers do feel superb to play as_ with their own abilities and Bravery arts to make use of. I am pretty mixed on the mechanic as a whole_ though_ as I definitely would’ve preferred an option to just play as them outright in addition to the protagonist. It probably won’t be such a huge deal if Origins is your first Warriors game_ but_ as a long-time fan_ I can’t help but miss being able to play as a wider variety of Three Kingdoms heroes freely.  A truly modern Musou  I think it’s fair to say that Dynasty Warriors Origins absolutely achieves what it sets out to do in revitalizing the Musou experience for a modern audience. It gave me that same “there is simply nothing else like this” feeling that I had with Dynasty Warriors 5 back in my teens. Nowhere is this more apparent than with Origins’ electrifying large-scale battles.  The general gameplay loop largely remains unchanged if you’re familiar with the Musou format. Most maps will have you eliminating enemy officers_ taking over key bases_ or escorting units to a particular location. With the power of current-generation gaming systems_ however_ Omega Force is finally able to make these battles feel truly large and cinematic.  That’s driven home by one major new feature: charges. When prompted to do so_ you can head to a location on the map where your army has gathered to initiate a forward charge. This_ for me_ is the high point of any battle_ as the camera pans back to give a wide view of the battlefield as you charge head-on towards the opposing army. A subtle screen shake and the courageous screams of your infantry further sell the moment as hundreds of troops clash into each other for an ultimate confrontation. It’s a moment that feels immensely rewarding and satisfying_ and again_ is unlike anything I’ve seen in any other action game_ let alone any other Warriors title.  This incredible presentation is backed up by some pretty impressive visuals and yes_ that trademark Dynasty Warriors brand of hard rock for the soundtrack. Perhaps most surprising of all_ though_ Origins is able to maintain a steady 60 frames per second (fps) in the default performance mode. There are also options for 30fps and 120fps modes_ but the trade-offs here are either choppier performance or too big of a loss in visual clarity_ respectively. The 60fps mode provides a pretty nice sweet spot and is the mode I would recommend for players without a high-end PC or PS5 Pro.  Should I play Dynasty Warriors Origins?  Play it if…  Don’t play it if…  Accessibility  Dynasty Warriors Origins has a handful of helpful accessibility options_ led by three ‘color perception’ settings aimed at colorblind players These are unhelpfully labeled as settings ‘1_ 2 and 3’ so you’ll need to switch between each to find which one best suits your needs. You can also adjust subtitle size_ and choose to have a boxed backdrop for subtitles for easier reading.  Beyond this_ there’s not much to speak of beyond the usual camera sensitivity and rumble adjustment settings. It is worth noting_ though_ that the three difficulty levels can be swapped between during the campaign itself_ so there’s no need to commit if things are getting too easy or too hard as you progress.  How I reviewed Dynasty Warriors Origins  I played Dynasty Warriors Origins for 30 hours on PS5_ taking me to the end of the main campaign. This playtime is expected to increase_ though_ as I head back into New Game Plus to try out other routes on the way to unlocking the game’s ‘true’ ending.  I played the game on a 4K LG CX OLED TV_ primarily using the DualSense Wireless Controller to experience Origins’ fairly light usage of its haptic feedback. I often paired this with a JBL Quantum 910P gaming headset for a rich audio experience.  First reviewed January 2025

280261460,January 6_ 2025 Smith’s Report Violates The Presumption of Innocence The presumption of innocence is “the undoubted law_ axiomatic and elementary.” Coffin v. United States_ 156 U.S. 432_ 453 (1895). It is “vital and fundamental” to our Constitutional system_ id. at 460_ and “its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law_” id. at 453; see also Cool v. United States_ 409 U.S. 100_ 104 (1972) (holding violation of defendant’s “constitutionally rooted presumption of innocence” required reversal). “The presumption serves as a reminder to the jury that the prosecution has the burden of proving every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt_” United States v. Starks_ 34 F.4th 1142_ 1158 (10th Cir. 2022)_ and thus_ may be “extinguished only upon the jury’s determination that guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt_” Mahorney v. Wallman_ 917 F.2d 469_ 471 n.2 (10th Cir. 1990) (emphasis in original) (collecting cases). Consistent with these bedrock principles_ the Justice Manual prohibits prosecutors from publicly declaring a defendant’s guilt prior to a jury verdict_ or otherwise disseminating statements inconsistent with the presumption of innocence. Justice Manual §§ 1.7.500; 1-7.600; 28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a) (“A Special Counsel shall comply with the rules_ regulations_ procedures_ practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”). Rather_ prosecutors must limit their statements to “[t]he substance of the charge_ as contained in the complaint_ indictment_ information_ or other public documents” and any “release issued before a finding of guilt should state that the charge is merely an accusation_ and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Justice Manual § 1.7.500. Moreover_ “DOJ personnel should refrain from disclosing” inter alia. “[a]ny opinion as to [a] defendant’s guilt” or any other “[o]bservations about a defendant’s or party’s character” “except as appropriate in the proceeding or in an announcement after a finding of guilt.” Justice Manual § 1-7.610 (emphasis added). These restrictions ensure that the Department’s statements do not “prejudice the rights of a defendant; or unfairly damage the reputation of a person.” Justice Manual § 1-7.100; see also 32 C.F.R. § 776.47 (“Except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the trial counsel’s actions and that serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose_ refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.”); D.C. Bar Rule 3.8 (same). The Draft Report violates every one of these core requirements. Despite Smith’s decision to dismiss his cases against President Trump_ and his complete failure to obtain a “jury’s determination that guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt_” Mahorney_ 917 F.2d at 471 n.2 (emphasis in original)_ his Draft Report repeatedly_ and falsely_ claims that President Trump_ Carlos De Oliveria_ Waltine Nauta_ and others have committed crimes and otherwise engaged in purported “criminal conduct.” For example_ Volume I of the Draft Report falsely asserts_ without any jury determination_ that President Trump and others “engaged in an unprecedented criminal effort_” was “the head of the criminal conspiracies_” and harbored a “criminal design.” Draft Report_ Vol. I at 2_ 68_ 69. These false accusations of criminality_ which Smith again utterly failed to prove in Court_ repeat throughout Volume I. See_ e.g._ id. at 3_ 52_ 60_ 64_ 67_ 88_ 108. Likewise_ Volume II asserts_ without any supporting verdict_ “that Mr. Trump violated multiple federal criminal laws_” and that he and others engaged in “criminal conduct.” Vol. II at 60_ 88; see also_ e.g._ id. at 89_ 121. Moreover_ the Draft Report makes these allegations despite Blanche Law PLLC 99 Wall Street_ Suite 4460 | New York_ NY 10005 (212) 716-1250 | www.BlancheLaw.com
280250450,Jessica Simpson and husband Eric Johnson are taking time apart.   The singer and actress_ 44_ and her former NFL player husband_ 45_ are separating after 10 years of marriage_ Simpson tells PEOPLE exclusively.   "Eric and I have been living separately navigating a painful situation in our marriage_" Simpson said in a statement to PEOPLE. "Our children come first_ and we are focusing on what is best for them. We are grateful for all of the love and support that has been coming our way_ and appreciate privacy right now as we work through this as a family."    The news comes less than one week after Simpson — who shares three children with Johnson — posted a sunny selfie to Instagram_ reminding her followers that "Life is short. SMILE while you still have teeth😜."   Johnson was spotted without his wedding ring in November_ around the same time Simpson teased her "comeback" to music with a cryptic Instagram post that featured photos of herself in a recording studio.   "Interviews in my Nashville music room where I unearthed my singular magic_" she captioned the images. "This comeback is personal. It’s an apology to myself for putting up with everything I did not deserve."   A source told PEOPLE days later that that the "With You" singer and her husband "very much live separate lives."   Simpson and Johnson married in July 2014 after four years of dating and share three children: daughters Maxwell "Maxi" Drew_ 12_ and Birdie Mae_ 5_ and son Ace Knute_ 11.   The pair first met through a mutual friend in 2010 and were engaged that November after six months of dating.   The Open Book author and the retired tight end welcomed their first two children_ Maxwell and Ace_ in May 2012 and June 2013_ respectively.   Their son and daughter appeared as the ring bearer and flower girl when the couple tied the knot before more than 250 guests in Montecito_ Calif.   "A true love will never make you question yourself or what's real_" she told PEOPLE in 2023. "Thanks to my amazing soulmate I am able to love passionately and without fear of being hurt."   That same year_ Simpson opened up to PEOPLE about how Johnson "embraces" her career.   "I don't find it hard to love anybody_ but I have always thought that I was hard to love_ that I was too much for people_ or my schedule was too demanding_" she shared. "He knows my heart and understands my heart more than anyone I've ever met in my life."   Simpson also said that their relationship has always felt "easy" and that they've always tried to "keep the romance there_ even with three kids."   For Johnson's birthday in September 2023_ she shared photos on Instagram from their family birthday celebration and paid tribute to him in a sweet caption.   "My heart is so taken with this Man_ I could hardly call it my own.... We love youuuu_" she wrote.   The pair also spent time sans kids in early 2023 by taking a couples getaway in March.

280242658,Village People have joined the presidential inaugural activities for Donald Trump.    The group took to Facebook on Monday (Jan. 13) to announce that they have “accepted an invitation from President Elect Trump’s campaign to participate in inaugural activities_ including at least one event with President Elect Trump.”   They continued_ “We know this wont make some of you happy to hear however we believe that music is to be performed without regard to politics. Our song Y.M.C.A. is a global anthem that hopefully helps bring the country together after a tumultuous and divided campaign where our preferred candidate lost.”   The statement concluded_ “Therefore_ we believe it’s now time to bring the country together with music which is why VILLAGE PEOPLE will be performing at various events as part of the 2025 Inauguration of Donald J. Trump.”   See the post here.   According to The Hill_ the group will perform at Trump’s “victory rally” at Capital One Arena in Washington_ and at the Liberty Inaugural Ball.   “Macho Man” and “Y.M.C.A.” were popular song choices at Trump campaign rallies during his 2020 and 2024 campaign rallies.   In December_ Village People’s Victor Willis doubled down on why he chose to let the president-elect play “Y.M.C.A.” at rallies and events_ saying he “didn’t have the heart” to block the usage — despite originally asking Trump to stop in 2020 — upon realizing that the politician seemed to “genuinely like” and was “having a lot of fun” with “Y.M.C.A.” Plus_ as Willis noted_ the dance tune has only “benefited greatly” in terms of chart placements and sales since the twice-impeached former POTUS incorporated it into his campaign.   Earlier in the day_ it was revealed that Carrie Underwood will be performing at the presidential inauguration ceremony on Monday_ Jan. 20_ at the U.S. Capitol in Washington_ D.C.. The eight-time Grammy winner will perform “America the Beautiful_” accompanied by The Armed Forces Chorus and the The United States Naval Academy Glee Club.   She shared to Billboard via a statement_ “I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event. I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”
280375966,Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Linkedin  President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he hopes to create a new federal entity in charge of collecting revenue from his proposed import taxes upon his inauguration_ signaling a further backing of Trump’s controversial tariffs_ though Trump would likely lack the authority to make an entirely new agency.  Trump declared next Monday will be the “birth date” of the IRS counterpart as tariffs become a core ... [+] storyline at the start of his second term. Getty Images  Trump wants to create an “External Revenue Service_” he said in a post to his Truth Social platform.  The proposed entity_ which would be a counterpart to the federal tax-focused Internal Revenue Service_ would “collect our Tariffs_ Duties_ and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources_” according to Trump_ nodding to the universal tariffs at the core of his economic platform.  Next Monday—the date of his inauguration—will be the “birth date” of the External Revenue Service_ Trump declared.  Can Trump Create The External Revenue Service As A Federal Agency?  It is Congress_ not the President_ which has the power to create federal agencies_ according to the Constitution_ complicating Trump’s goal to immediately create the External Revenue Service_ though Republicans hold a majority in the House and Senate.  The establishment of a new federal agency apparently moves against the objectives of Trump megadonor and $400 billion man Elon Musk. Musk_ the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency commission backed by Trump_ said in November he hopes to cut the number of federal agencies from over 400 to 99 or less_ a more than 75% reduction.  Key Background  The Customs and Border Protection_ a part of the Department of Homeland Security_ is in charge of collecting tariffs. Trump has supported tariffs of at least 10% on imported goods_ a policy designed to boost domestic manufacturing and as a foreign policy negotiation tool_ though economists warn tariffs may worsen inflation as companies pass on the taxes to customers.

280357018,Rashida Jones_ the president of MSNBC_ announced Tuesday that she is stepping down after four years of steering the cable news network. Jones_ who made history as the first Black executive to lead a major U.S. television news network_ made the announcement to top MSNBC anchors_ leaders and network staff on Tuesday morning. (MSNBC and NBC News are both units of NBCUniversal.) Rebecca Kutler_ the network's senior vice president of content strategy_ was named interim MSNBC president. Jones_ who recruited Kutler to the network in 2022_ plans to stay on in an advisory role until March. “I came to this decision over the holidays while reflecting on our remarkable journey and the many successes we’ve achieved together as a team. This has been the most rewarding chapter of my professional career and I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished_ which has been made possible only by you_” Jones said in a memo to staff. The announcement comes nearly two months after Comcast announced a plan to spin off most of its cable TV networks into a separate publicly traded company_ currently known as SpinCo. The new company will include MSNBC_ CNBC_ the USA Network_ Oxygen_ E!_ SYFY and the Golf Channel. Jones took charge of MSNBC in February 2021 after the inauguration of President Joe Biden and the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. She drove MSNBC to ratings triumphs on major political nights. She retained and signed new long-term deals with the network’s top talent_ including Rachel Maddow.

The network still ended last year as the No. 2 network across cable_ with 807_000 average viewers daily and 1.3 million viewers in the prime-time hours. The cable television business writ large is at a crossroads as consumers move toward streaming alternatives such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

MSNBC is well-positioned for the future_” Lazarus said in a memo to staff. Lazarus told staff members on a network call that MSNBC will retain its name after the spin-off transaction is complete.

280435224,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been arrested_ six weeks after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law.  A motorcade of black SUVs was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where he had been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire and a small army of personal security.  Mr Yoon said the “rule of law has completely collapsed” in a video message recorded before he was escorted to the headquarters of an anti-corruption agency.  He said he was complying with the detention warrant to prevent clashes between police and the presidential security service.  Police had been trying to access the president’s official office to detain him but had become engaged in a standoff with Mr Yoon’s security service.  Hours later hundreds of officers made it onto the grounds of the property by using ladders to climb over barriers.  Earlier police said they had deployed 3_200 officers to execute the arrest warrant.  One person who collapsed amid the standoff has been transported away from the scene by the fire department_ local media said.  The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police are jointly investigating whether Mr Yoon’s martial law declaration on 3 December amounted to an attempted rebellion.  What happened on 3 December?  Mr Yoon declared martial law and deployed troops around the National Assembly at the beginning of last month.  It lasted only hours before politicians managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.  His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December_ accusing him of rebellion.  Mr Yoon has argued his declaration of martial law was a legitimate act of governance_ calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party_ which he has described as “despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces”.  He claimed the party used its legislative majority to impeach top officials and undermine the government’s budget.  Over the past two weeks_ thousands of anti- and pro-Yoon protesters have gathered daily in competing rallies near his office in Seoul_ in anticipation of his detention.

280427984,The SEC filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk on Tuesday_ alleging the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022 by failing to disclose he had amassed an active stake in Twitter_ a secrecy that allowed him to buy shares at “artificially low prices.”  Musk_ who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX_ purchased Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and changed the name to X the following year. Prior to the acquisition_ he’d built up a position in the company of greater than 5%_ which would’ve required disclosing his holdings to the public within 10 calendar days of reaching that threshold.   According to the SEC’s civil complaint_ filed in U.S. District Court in Washington_ D.C._ Musk was more than 10 days late in reporting that material information_ “allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.”  The SEC had been investigating whether Musk_ or anyone else working with him_ committed securities fraud in 2022 as the Tesla CEO sold shares in his car company and shored up his stake in Twitter ahead of his leveraged buyout. Musk said in a post on X last month that the SEC issued a “settlement demand_” pressuring him to agree to a deal including a fine within 48 hours or “face charges on numerous counts” regarding the purchase of shares.  Musk’s lawyer_ Alex Spiro_ said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the SEC’s action is an admission that “they cannot bring an actual case.” He added that Musk “has done nothing wrong” and called the suit a “sham” and the result of a “multi-year campaign of harassment_” culminating in a “single-count ticky tak complaint.”  Musk is just a week away from having a potentially influential role in government_ as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term begins on Jan. 20. Musk_ who was a major financial backer of Trump in the latter stages of the campaign_ is poised to lead an advisory group that will focus in part on reducing regulations_ including those that affect Musk’s various companies.  In July_ Trump vowed to fire SEC chairman Gary Gensler. After Trump’s election victory_ Gensler announced that he would be resigning from his post instead.  In a separate civil lawsuit concerning the Twitter deal_ the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System sued Musk_ accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in the social network and intent to buy the company. The pension fund’s attorneys argued that Musk_ by failing to clearly disclose his investments_ had influenced other shareholders’ decisions and put them at a disadvantage.  The SEC said that Musk crossed the 5% ownership mark in March 2022 and would have been required to disclose his holdings by March 24.  “On April 4_ 2022_ eleven days after a report was due_ Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC_ disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock_” the complaint says. “That day_ Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price.”  The SEC alleges that Musk spent over $500 million purchasing more Twitter shares during the time between the required disclosure and the day of his actual filing. That enabled him to buy stock from the “unsuspecting public at artificially low prices_” the complaint says. He “underpaid” Twitter shareholders by over $150 million during that period_ according to the SEC.  In the complaint_ the SEC is seeking a jury trial and asks that Musk be forced to “pay disgorgement of his unjust enrichment” as well as a civil penalty.  For a brief period in April 2022_ after his ownership had been made public and it was known that he was the biggest shareholder_ Musk was set to join Twitter’s board. However_ he quickly abandoned that plan_ telling the board he would not take a seat.  What followed was a six-month drama that began with Musk submitting an unsolicited bid in mid-April that was opposed by the board. Twitter’s board eventually accepted Musk’s offer later that month. Soon thereafter_ Musk tried to back out_ alleging that Twitter was misstating the number of “bots” on its service  Musk ultimately closed the deal in October 2022_ famously walking into the company’s office in San Francisco with a sink in his hands.  “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!” Musk wrote_ attaching a video of his entrance.
280552320,DOHA_ Qatar — Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war in the Gaza Strip_ multiple officials announced Wednesday_ raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies.  The deal promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel_ and it will allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a territory ravaged by 15 months of war.  The prime minister of Qatar_ Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani_ said the ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday. He made the announcement in the Qatari capital of Doha_ the site of weeks of painstaking negotiations.  U.S. President Joe Biden then touted the deal from Washington_ saying the ceasefire will stay in place as long as Israel and Hamas remain at the negotiating table over a long-term truce. Biden said his administration and President-elect Donald Trump’s team were “speaking as one” in the negotiations.  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that final details were being ironed out and that it hoped “details will be finalized tonight.”  An Israeli official familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity said those details center on confirming the list of Palestinian prisoners who are to be freed. Any agreement must be approved by Netanyahu’s Cabinet.  Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu’s government to approve the ceasefire in a nationally televised speech. Hamas said in a statement that the ceasefire was “the result of the legendary resilience of our great Palestinian people and our valiant resistance in the Gaza Strip.”  Once the deal officially begins_ it is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether.  Over those six weeks_ 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in in captivity with no contact with the outside world_ though it’s unclear if all are alive.  It remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to what remains of their homes and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives.  Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain_ including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction after a brutal conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.  Still_ the announcement offered the first sign of hope in months that Israel and Hamas may be winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought_ a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.  Sen. Dick Durbin_ an Illinois Democrat_ expressed relief at news of the breakthrough_ saying he was “heartened to hear about a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Gaza. The widespread suffering_ death_ and destruction on all sides has been heartbreaking and desperately needed to end.”   Mamayan Jabateh_ a 21-year-old University of Chicago senior who was arrested for their involvement in campus protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza_ described her reaction to the news as “absolutely joy.  “I think this is what student organizers have been wanting for a very long time_” Jabateh said. “We need to restore faith_ we need to build back what was broken. It’s hard looking that far_ but so many people have been harmed_ so many families have been torn apart — and we can be joyful that this moment has finally happened. But I think we can also mourn that it took this long to happen_ and I’m mourning that right now.”  Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7_ 2023_ cross-border attack_ which killed some 1_200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46_000 Palestinians_ according to local health officials_ displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and sparked a humanitarian crisis.  More than 100 hostages were freed from Gaza in a weeklong truce in November 2023.  The U.S._ along with Egypt and Qatar_ have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. It comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in November_ after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in the Gaza.  Israel responded with a brutal air and ground offensive that has killed over 46_000 Palestinians_ according to local health officials. They do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.  U.N. and international relief organizations estimate that some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced_ often multiple times. They say tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hospitals are barely functioning. Experts have warned that famine may be underway in northern Gaza_ where Israel launched a major offensive in early October_ displacing tens of thousands of residents.  “The best day in my life and the life of the Gaza people_” Abed Radwan_ a Palestinian father of three_ said of the ceasefire deal. “Thank God. Thank God.”  Radwan_ who has been displaced from the town of Beit Lahiya for over a year and shelters in Gaza City_ said he will try to return to his hometown_ and “rebuild my house_ and rebuild Beit Lahiya.”  He spoke to AP over the phone. His voice has been overshadowed by celebrations. “People are crying here. They don’t believe it’s true.”  In Israel_ hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv_ calling for a deal to be completed. Many held posters of hostages held by Hamas_ others hoisted candles in the air.  As the deal was announced_ some people were unaware that it had gone through. Sharone Lifschitz_ whose father Oded is being held in Gaza_ told the AP by phone she was stunned and grateful but won’t believe it until she sees all the hostages come home.  “I’m so desperate to see them if by some miracle my father has survived_” she said.  Biden_ who has provided crucial military aid to Israel but expressed exasperation over civilian deaths_ announced the outline of the three-phase ceasefire agreement on May 31. The agreement eventually agreed to followed that framework.  He said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a “full and complete ceasefire_” a withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages_ including women_ older adults and wounded people_ in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian assistance would surge_ with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza each day.  The second and most difficult phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages_ including male soldiers_ and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. The third phase calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza_ which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.  Hamas had been demanding assurances for a permanent end to the war and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel_ meanwhile_ has repeatedly said it would not halt the war until it destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities.  The various players have conducted months of on-again_ off-again negotiations. But with Biden’s days in office numbered and President-elect Donald Trump set to take over_ both sides had been under heavy pressure to agree to a deal.  Trump celebrated the soon-to-be-announced agreement in a posting on his Truth Social social media platform: “WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!”  Hezbollah’s acceptance of a ceasefire in Lebanon after it had suffered heavy blows_ and the overthrow of President Bashar Assad in Syria_ were both major setbacks for Iran and its allies across the region_ including Hamas_ which was left increasingly isolated.  Israel has come under heavy international criticism_ including from its closest ally_ the United States_ over the civilian toll. Israel says it has killed around 17_000 militants — though it has not provided evidence to support the claim. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties_ accusing the group of using schools_ hospitals and residential areas for military purposes.  The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations brought by South Africa that Israel has committed genocide. The International Criminal Court_ a separate body also based in The Hague_ has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu_ his defense minister and a Hamas commander for war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the war.  Israel and the United States have condemned the actions taken by both courts.  Netanyahu also faced great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages_ whose plight has captured the nation’s attention. Their families have become a powerful lobbying group with wide public support backed by months of mass protests urging the government to reach a deal with Hamas.  Israeli authorities have already concluded that more than a third of the roughly 100 remaining people held captive are dead_ and there are fears that others are no longer alive. A series of videos released by Hamas showing surviving hostages in distress_ combined with news that a growing number of abducted Israelis have died_ put added pressure on the Israeli leader.  Hamas_ a militant group that does not accept Israel’s existence_ has come under overwhelming pressure from Israeli military operations_ including the invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and the takeover of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders_ including Yahya Sinwar_ who was believed to have helped mastermind the Oct. 7_ 2023_ attack_ have been killed.  But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces_ raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.  Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But it has never been clear what that would entail or if it’s even possible_ given the group’s deep roots in Palestinian society_ its presence in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank_ and its exiled leadership.  If the ceasefire takes hold_ both sides face many difficult and unanswered questions.  As the war winds down_ Netanyahu will face growing calls for postwar investigations that could find him at least partially responsible for the security failures of Oct. 7 — the worst in Israel’s history. His far-right governing partners_ who opposed a ceasefire deal_ could also bring down the coalition and push the country into early elections.  There is still no plan for who will govern Gaza after the war. Israel has said it will work with local Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. But it is unclear if such partners exist_ and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israeli forces.  The United States has tried to advance sweeping postwar plans for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza with Arab and international assistance. As part of those plans_ the U.S. hope Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in return for U.S. security guarantees and aid in setting up a civilian nuclear program.  But those plans depend on credible progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state_ something Netanyahu and much of Israel’s political class oppose. Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank_ territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for their future state.  In the absence of a postwar arrangement with Palestinian support_ Hamas is likely to remain a significant force in Gaza and could reconstitute its military capabilities if Israeli forces fully withdraw.

280446670,On the Day of a Solar Opposition  There are many ways to discuss problems_ including the option of not discussing and hoping it goes away. This is a day to avoid that style and opt for clearing the air with something brave and proactive. The lunar opposition to Mars in domestic Cancer throws an adage into the mix: “Tell me early_ I’m your friend. Tell me late_ I’m your critic.”  CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). It’s a full day of back-to-back interactions_ and your high energy will have you shining. You’ll seize the opportunity to uplift and inspire others_ making a positive influence on those lucky enough to cross your path.  AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). If a thing can’t be proven_ why argue the matter? There’s a good reason. Because the discussion tells you something about the other person_ their character_ general communication style and what’s important to them. It’s not about the topic. It’s about the dynamic.  PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). There’s no universally correct way to see things. Everyone has a distorted viewpoint when compared to that of another. You’ll reflect on what could be considered a distortion and how it impacts your judgment_ decisions or understanding of a situation.  ARIES (March 21-April 19). Invite people into your life and plans. While there’s a tipping point where involving too many can become overly complicated or cumbersome_ you’re still far from that number -- so keep the invitations flowing and enjoy the connections you make along the way!  TAURUS (April 20-May 20). For a relationship to work well_ both parties should agree on the boundaries. This is best done organically because people may agree in theory to things they do not agree with in practice.  GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You’ve been influenced by memorable people whose lasting impressions kept you following their advice and examples. You’ll now consider how you can create guides for others.  CANCER (June 22-July 22). The classic question of whether the glass is half-full or half-empty wouldn’t arise if the glass simply matched the amount it held. Thinking about efficiency early in any endeavor will prevent problems and keep the focus productive.  LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). The task will be challenging_ so it will be hard to want to stick with it. Even the smallest thing can become a distraction. Instead of acting on every whim_ jot down unhelpful impulses in a note. This simple act will keep you on track throughout this busy day.  VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). You’ll find yourself in a position to appoint someone in an important role. To assess their potential_ take a close look at their current performance. The evidence will speak for itself_ and you can safely assume that what’s happening now will happen again later.  LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). The ways you protect yourself from the world will be highlighted. While some boundaries are essential_ others might be keeping you from experiencing the joy and connection you deserve. Where can you open up more?  SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). There’s a maddening paradox in play: While fairness may be a myth_ so is futility. In the absence of justice_ we can still act and find meaning in the cracks. If nothing is fair_ then we can build something even better: purpose.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You’re a critical thinker_ but you’re careful to communicate in an unfailingly constructive and supportive way_ and even then_ only when asked. People rarely follow the advice they asked for_ and unsolicited advice goes straight to the mental trash bin.  TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 15). Past baggage falls away and you feel powerful_ attractive and vital. People feel important around you because they are_ in fact_ important to you_ and your friendship is an adventure_ a discovery and an art. More highlights: You’ll hit the financial goals you aim for. You’ll become a master of something difficult. A move brings new activities and social circles. Sagittarius and Aquarius adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 13_ 15_ 20_ 11 and 33.  CELEBRITY PROFILES: Martin Luther King Jr.’s enduring legacy continues to inspire and influence in many ways_ including the partnership between the Martin Luther King III Foundation and the NFL_ launching the “Realizing the Dream” initiative to engage youth_ educators and communities worldwide in performing 100 million hours of community service by 2029_ aligning with the centennial of Dr. King’s birth -- a day when Mercury was in the humanitarian sign of Aquarius and the moon was in spiritual Pisces. “All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.” -- Martin Luther King Jr.  Holiday Mathis’ debut novel_ “How To Fail Epically in Hollywood_” is out now!

280547326,By The Associated Press  The Transportation Department is stepping up enforcement of persistent flight delays with a lawsuit against Southwest Airlines and a fine against Frontier Airlines.  The agency said the U.S. District Court lawsuit it filed in California on Wednesday alleges that Southwest illegally operated chronically delayed flights and disrupted passengers’ travel plans. It says it’s seeking “maximum civil penalties.”  “Airlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times_” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “Today’s action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.”  The Transportation Department said its investigation found that Dallas-based Southwest operated two chronically delayed flights – one between Chicago Midway International Airport and Oakland_ California_ and another between Baltimore_ Maryland and Cleveland_ Ohio.  Both flights were chronically delayed for five straight months and together resulted in 180 flight disruptions for passengers between April and August 2022_ the agency said.  The department fined Frontier Airlines $650_000 in civil penalties with $325_000 to be paid to the U.S. Treasury and the remaining $325_000 to be suspended if the carrier does not operate any chronically delayed flights in the next three years.  Aviation-data provider Cirium said in a report released this month that Southwest ranked fifth among the 10 North American airlines it evaluated for their on-time performance_ with 77.8% of arrivals and a little under 77% of departures last year taking place in a timely way. By comparison_ top-ranked Delta Air Lines scored 83.5% for arrivals and 83.7% for departures.  Last year_ federal regulators increased their scrutiny of Southwest Airlines after a series of incidents_ including flying at very low altitudes while still miles away from an airport. The Federal Aviation Administration said in July it wanted to ensure the carrier was complying with federal safety regulations. The FAA declined to provide details_ but noted that it continually adjusts oversight of airlines based on risk.
280813994,Nintendo has released a trailer finally announcing the Switch 2. The trailer_ which starts with the original Switch_ gradually transforms the console into the Switch 2. Check it out below.

280657290,Blue Origin_ the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos_ launched its massive New Glenn rocket for the first time early Thursday_ a livestream of the blastoff showed.The rocket_ whose inaugural mission had been delayed by several years_ blasted of at 2:03 am (0703 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in the US state of Florida_ the webcast showed.The mission is seen as critical to Blue Origin's efforts to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX_ which dominates the commercial space industry."LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars_" Blue Origin said on social media platform X."New Glenn has passed the Karman line_ the internationally recognized boundary of space!" the firm posted just a few minutes later.And then: "Second stage engine cutoff confirmed. New Glenn's second stage and payload are now in orbit."An initial test launch of the towering 320-foot (98-meter) rocket_ dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary American astronaut John Glenn_ had been scrubbed early Monday morning after repeated halts during the countdown.The company later said it had discovered an icing issue on a purge line and would aim for a possible early Tuesday morning launch_ but that weather conditions were unfavorable.On Monday night_ Blue Origin announced that launch had been postponed.With the mission_ dubbed NG-1_ Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: fellow tech innovator Musk.Musk's company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets_ which have become vital for the commercial sector_ Pentagon and NASA."SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town_ and so having a competitor... this is great_" G. Scott Hubbard_ a retired senior NASA official_ earlier told AFP_ expecting the competition to drive down costs.Upping the high-stakes rivalry_ SpaceX also plans another orbital test this week of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket.Blue Origin will now attempt to land New Glenn's first-stage booster on a drone ship stationed about 620 miles (1_000 kilometers) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.SpaceX has made such landings now routine_ but this will be Blue Origin's first shot at the sci-fi feat.High seas last week caused the New Glenn launch to be pushed back several days.Meanwhile_ the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit_ reaching a maximum altitude of roughly 12_000 miles above the surface.A Defense Department-funded prototype of an advanced spaceship called Blue Ring_ which could one day journey through the solar system_ will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.Blue Origin has experience landing its New Shepard rockets -- used for suborbital tourism -- but they are five times smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.Physically_ the gleaming white New Glenn dwarfs SpaceX's 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed for heavier payloads.It slots between Falcon 9 and its big sibling_ Falcon Heavy_ in terms of mass capacity but holds an edge with its wider payload fairing_ capable of carrying the equivalent of 20 moving trucks.Blue Origin has already secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper_ a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.For now_ however_ SpaceX maintains a commanding lead_ while other rivals -- United Launch Alliance_ Arianespace_ and Rocket Lab -- trail far behind.Like Musk_ Bezos has a lifelong passion for space.But where Musk dreams of colonizing Mars_ Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry off-planet onto floating space platforms in order to preserve Earth_ "humanity's blue origin."If New Glenn succeeds_ it will provide the US government "dissimilar redundancy" -- valuable backup if one system fails_ said Scott Pace_ a space policy analyst at George Washington University.

280625008,US President Joe Biden urged Americans Wednesday to "stand guard" against a "dangerous" oligarchy forming under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address before stepping down next week.In a primetime speech from the Oval Office at the end of his single term in office_ the 82-year-old warned of an ultra-wealthy "tech industrial complex" that could gain unchecked power over the American people."Today_ an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth_ power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy_" the 82-year-old Democrat said."That's a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people."Biden also lashed out at social media firms_ with X owner and the world's richest man Elon Musk set to play a key role in Trump's incoming administration and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg courting the Republican."Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation_ enabling the abuse of power_" said Biden.Biden also warned of the dangers of AI_ saying that America must take the "lead" over China on the transformative technology_ and said that "powerful forces" threatened his climate achievements.Signing off Trump returns for a second term on January 20_ Biden told Americans: "Now it's your turn to stand guard." Biden's speech took a dark turn after he began by touting his legacy on the economy_ healthcare_ climate and tackling the gun violence that plagues the United States.America's oldest ever president has spent much of his final months in office trying to burnish his reputation before he is replaced by the bitter political rival he defeated in the 2020 election -- a result Trump still disputes.Biden's efforts got a boost earlier Wednesday when Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal Biden said he'd ordered his administration to cooperate with Trump's team to reach an accord.But his legacy was badly damaged by his decision to run for a second term despite his age.The Democrat was forced to drop out of the race last June after a disastrous debate against Trump_ 78_ who went on to a commanding victory over Biden's vice president_ Kamala Harris.Polls show Biden remains an unpopular president. A CNN poll published Wednesday showed him with a 36 percent approval rating_ remaining at the lowest of his term.That puts him above Trump_ who left office with a 34 percent approval rating_ according to the American Presidency Project. The lowest in recent times was Richard Nixon with 24 percent while the highest was Bill Clinton with 66 percent_ followed by Barack Obama with 59 percent.In a letter previewing his remarks Biden took an implicit swipe at Trump earlier Wednesday_ saying that he "ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake.""And_ that's still the case_" Biden said in the letter.Biden added in the letter that "I have given my heart and my soul to our nation" and that it had been the "privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years."The White House also released a dossier of more than 100-pages setting out his achievements from the economy to healthcare and climate change.In a farewell interview in the Washington Post published Wednesday_ outgoing First Lady Jill Biden took a dig at the Democratic Party for pressing Biden to drop out."Let's just say I was disappointed with how it unfolded_" she said.Emotions ran high at the White House ahead of his speech.Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre -- part of a team that brought back regular media briefings after Trump ended them during his first term -- fought back tears on her last appearance at the famous podium as she described the "honor of a lifetime."

281202256,By MARK SHERMAN_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless it’s sold by its China-based parent company_ holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States.  A sale does not appear imminent and_ although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users’ phones once the law takes effect on Jan. 19_ new users won’t be able to download it and updates won’t be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable_ the Justice Department has said in court filings.  The decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump_ who vowed that he could negotiate a solution and the administration of President Joe Biden_ which has signaled it won’t enforce the law beginning Sunday_ his final full day in office.  Trump_ mindful of TikTok’s popularity_ and his own 14.7 million followers on the app_ finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikTok’s Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now.  It’s unclear what options are open to Trump once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar_ who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration_ told the justices last week that it’s uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok.  “Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary_” the court said in an unsigned opinion_ adding that the law “does not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.”  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch filed short separate opinions noting some reservations about the court’s decision but going along with the outcome.  At arguments_ the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd._ the Chinese technology company that is its parent_ how difficult it would be to consummate a deal_ especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.  The app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long_ according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive and harms kids’ mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate.  The dispute over TikTok’s ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing.  The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data_ including sensitive information on viewing habits_ that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities_ who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.  TikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok.  Bipartisan majorities in Congress passed legislation_ and President Joe Biden signed it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok_ which the government sees as a national security threat.  TikTok_ which sued the government last year over the law_ has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December_ prompting TikTok’s quick appeal to the Supreme Court.  Without a sale to an approved buyer_ the law bars app stores operated by Apple_ Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok.  ByteDance has said it won’t sell. But some investors have been eyeing it_ including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s U.S. assets. The consortium_ which includes “Shark Tank” host Kevin O’Leary_ did not disclose the financial terms of the offer.  Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect “might be just the jolt” ByteDance needs to reconsider its position.

281239650,The Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has been moved indoors due to cold weather.  “The various Dignitaries and Guests will be brought into the Capitol.

Biden said in a statement that commuting the nearly 2_500 sentences would help "equalize" sentencing disparities. "Today’s clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine_ as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes_" he said. "This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs_ correcting sentencing disparities_ and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars_" he added. "With this action_ I have now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history_" Biden said. Almost two dozen congressional Democrats last month urged Biden to commute the sentences of people affected by the sentencing disparities_ arguing that harsher penalties for crack “caused disproportionate harm to communities of color.” Two laws dramatically shifted sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses over the past 15 years. The Fair Sentencing Act_ which was signed into law in 2010_ lowered the statutory penalties for crack cocaine and tossed out the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing it. The First Step Act_ which became law in 2018_ made it possible to apply the reduced penalties to sentences for crack offenses that predated the 2010 law. Biden last month commuted nearly 1_500 sentences and issued pardons for 39 people in another sweeping clemency action. A subsequent move to commute 37 death sentences left only a handful of people on federal death row. According to the Justice Department’s clemency statistics_ President-elect Donald Trump issued 144 pardons and 94 commutations during his first term. President Barack Obama issued 212 pardons and 1_715 commutations over two terms. Perhaps the most controversial use of Biden's clemency power came when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden last month. The move was sharply criticized by Republicans and even some Democrats. In his statement Friday_ Biden indicated that he could take more clemency action before he leaves office Monday. "I am proud of my record on clemency and will continue to review additional commutations and pardons_" he said.
280969276,The actor Justin Baldoni filed a defamation lawsuit against the Hollywood stars Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds on Thursday_ claiming that they tried to destroy him by accusing him of sexual harassment against the actress and then retaliation against her through a smear campaign.  The lawsuit is the latest legal action in a feud tied to the 2024 film “It Ends With Us_” which starred Ms. Lively and Mr. Baldoni_ who also directed it.  The 179-page complaint_ filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York_ named Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds_ her husband_ as defendants_ as well as their publicist Leslie Sloane and her company_ Vision PR. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Mr. Baldoni; the film’s lead producer_ Jamey Heath; their production company_ Wayfarer Studios; and the publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel. They are seeking $400 million in damages.  Representatives for Ms. Lively’s team did not respond to a request for comment.  The New York Times published an article on Dec. 21 about Ms. Lively’s allegations against Mr. Baldoni. She claimed in a complaint_ filed a day earlier with the California Civil Rights Department_ that Mr. Baldoni had initiated the campaign after she accused him of sexual harassment during the shooting of “It Ends With Us.”
281122306,Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright_ who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II_ has died. She was 95.  In a statement Friday_ her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall_ a retirement home for actors in southern England_ surrounded by her loved ones.  "She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre_ film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire_" the family said. "We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being."  Part of an astonishing generation of British actors_ including Judi Dench_ Vanessa Redgrave_ Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith_ Plowright won a Tony Award_ two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.  From the 1950s to the 1980s_ Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" to William Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's "The Chairs_" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles "Major Barbara" and "Saint Joan."  "I've been very privileged to have such a life_" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with The Actor's Work. "I mean it's magic and I still feel_ when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain_ the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me."  Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg_ Lincolnshire_ England_ her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school_ she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester_ then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.  Following her London stage debut in 1954_ Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men_ such as John Osborne_ who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new_ rough-hewn_ working-class actors like Albert Finney_ Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.  Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's "Moby Dick" in 1956_ starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.  A year later_ she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's "The Entertainer." She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.  By then_ Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended_ as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961_ while both were starring on Broadway_ he in "Becket" and she in "A Taste of Honey_" for which she won a Tony.  One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: "I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you_ or write to you - a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence_ passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody."  Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that_ Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60_ satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.  She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of "Surviving Picasso_" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of "101 Dalmatians" in 1996 with Glenn Close.  She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip "Dennis the Menace_" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire "Last Action Hero" in 1993.  Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year_ in 1993_ when she won the supporting actress TV award for "Stalin" and the supporting actress movie award for "Enchanted April." For the latter_ which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy_ she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.  Not all her works were career roses_ as with the disastrous "The Scarlet Letter" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on "Driving Miss Daisy." An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy "Goose on the Loose" didn't rouse critics.  A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame - bestowing awards_ defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.  "That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him_" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. "When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes_ then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight."  Plowright is survived by her three children - Tamsin_ Richard and Julie-Kate_ all actors_ and several grandchildren.

281166246,Medicare announced Friday that it has selected 15 drugs_ including the hugely popular medications Ozempic and Wegovy_ used for diabetes and weight loss_ as well as some blockbuster cancer medications and other drugs_ for its second round of price talks. Together with the first 10 drugs that the Biden administration targeted for its Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program last year_ the medications make up a third of prescription drug spending in the government insurance program for seniors.Prices negotiated in this second round of talks are slated to take effect in 2027. The drugs announced Friday by the Biden administration are:Ozempic; Rybelsus; WegovyTrelegy ElliptaXtandiPomalystIbranceOfevLinzessCalquenceAustedo; Austedo XRBreo ElliptaTradjentaXifaxanVraylarJanumet; Janumet XROtezlaUnder the program's timeline_ drugmakers have until Feb. 28 to decide whether to either participate in the talks or face a hefty tax if they want to stay covered by Medicare and Medicaid.The White House says the first round of negotiations lowered the price of some of the most commonly used drugs in Medicare by about 40% to 80% compared to their list price_ though researchers estimate the actual savings were significantly smaller for many drugs. Those reduced prices go into effect next year.President Biden has touted the program_ created by the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law in 2022_ as one of his term's signature accomplishments."The Inflation Reduction Act put the country on a path to lower drug prices. I'm proud of my Administration's implementation of this law to deliver lower prices for America's seniors_" he said in a statement. Drugmakers have sought in court to stop the process. Industry groups and Republicans have blasted the "price-setting scheme" as unfair and discouraging innovation. The new round of talks come as the Biden administration has also proposed expanding Medicare coverage to weight loss drugs_ which had previously been prohibited. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the move. Can Trump change or halt the process?It is unclear whether President-elect Donald Trump would seek to change the drugs picked or stop the talks after he takes office. On the campaign trail_ he often pledged not to make cuts to Medicare after Democrats sought to tie him to a "Project 2025" proposal to undo the program. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not respond to a request for comment.Speaking with reporters on Thursday_ a senior Biden administration official said that the process to pick the drugs for the negotiation program was hemmed in by the law Congress passed.That law requires Medicare to essentially make a list of eligible drugs for the program_ and then select the drugs that make up the 15 highest in spending from Part D.They acknowledged that there were "very marginal decisions" that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had made in its guidance on how and when the drug talks would occur_ but those would not allow for a major change in which drugs were picked."That process_ again_ is clearly defined in statute. There is no ability for a policy official to say_ I prefer this drug over that drug. The entire process is based on these data_" the official said.Which drugs were selected for the first round?The Biden administration announced the 10 drugs selected for the first round of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in August 2023_ and reached an agreement in August 2024. The negotiated prices will take effect in 2026. Those drugs are:Merck Sharp Dohme's JanuviaNovo Nordisk's Fiasp and NovoLogAstraZeneca's FarxigaImmunex's EnbrelBoehringer Ingelheim's JardianceJanssen's Stelara Janssen's XareltoBristol Meyers Squibb's EliquisNovartis' EntrestoPharmacyclics' ImbruvicaCMS estimated last year that the savings they negotiated from the program would save around $1.5 billion for beneficiaries and $6 billion for the Medicare program.

281315844,The cease-fire between Hamas and Israel will go into effect in less than 24 hours_ said Qatar’s foreign ministry on Saturday. In a post on X_ Qatar’s foreign minister Majid Al Ansari_ said the cease-fire will start at 8:30 a.m. local time Sunday. He advised people to exercise caution when the agreement goes into effect and wait for directions from officials. Early Saturday morning_ Israel’s Cabinet approved the deal for a cease-fire in Gaza that would release dozens of hostages and pause the 15-month war with Hamas_ bringing the sides a step closer to ending their deadliest and most destructive fighting ever. Despite the cease-fire news_ sirens sounded across central Israel on Saturday_ with the army saying it intercepted projectiles launched from Yemen. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have stepped up their missile attacks_ in recent weeks. The group says the attacks are part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza. There were also continued Israeli strikes into Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 23 people were killed in the previous day. Under the first phase of the cease-fire_ 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks_ in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The remainder_ including male soldiers_ are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal. According to the cease-fire plan_ approved by the Cabinet and signed by Israel’s national security adviser_ the exchange will begin Sunday at 4 p.m. local time. During each exchange_ prisoners will be released by Israel after the hostages have arrived safely. The plan says that during the first phase_ some 1_900 Palestinian prisoners will be released_ in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages_ both alive and dead. Among the prisoners_ 1_167 are residents in Gaza who were held by Israel but were not involved in Hamas' Oct. 7_ 2023_ cross-border attack on Israel. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase. Palestinian prisoners who were convicted in the deadly attacks will be exiled_ either to Gaza or abroad_ and barred from returning to Israel or the West Bank_ according to the plan. Some will be exiled for three years and others permanently_ according to the plan. Key questions remain about the cease-fire_ however — the second achieved during the war — including the names of the 33 hostages who are to be released and who among them is still alive. Hamas has agreed to free three female hostages on Day 1 of the deal_ four on Day 7 and the remaining 26 over the following five weeks. Also during the first phase_ Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a half-mile wide inside Gaza_ along its borders with Israel. That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes_ including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza’s population driven into massive_ squalid tent camps_ Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes_ even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. The largely devastated territory should also see a surge in humanitarian aid. Trucks carrying aid lined up Friday on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza. On Saturday_ two Egyptian government ministers arrived in the northern Sinai Peninsula to oversee the preparations for the delivery of aid and to receive the evacuation of wounded patients_ the health ministry said. Hamas triggered the war with its 2023 attack into Israel that killed some 1_200 people and left some 250 others captive. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza. Israel responded with devastating air and ground attacks that have killed more than 46_000 Palestinians_ according to local health officials_ who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half the dead. Magdy and Mednick write for the Associated Press and reported from Cairo and Jersusalem_ respectively. AP reporter Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

281327736,On the flip side_ here are a few players we are sitting in during this Saturday afternoon’s Kansas City vs. Houston DFS.  John Metchie III (4_000-DraftKings/5_500-Fanduel)  Wide receiver John Metchie III is a player who should be on the fantasy bench for today’s DFS game. Metchie during the win against the Chargers had a fumble and 28 yards. The young Texans receiver has been struggling with fumbles this season_ which could cost players money. Fantasy players should sit Metchie down for today due to the Chiefs’ solid defense.  Travis Kelce (5_000-DraftKings/6_500-Fanduel)  Travis Kelce is another player who could have a rough night for fantasy players and should be sitting in today’s DFS game. Kelce this season had a weak season with 823 yards and 3 touchdowns. While the veteran could be a threat today_ he is also a non-factor for today’s fantasy. Kelce could be covered well with the Texans’ defense being hot during this playoff season.  Total Apex Lock of the Game  Xavier Worthy (5_200-DraftKings/6_400-Fanduel)  For the Total Apex lock of the game_ Chiefs receiver Xavier Worthy should be your lock of the day. The rookie receiver this season had 638 receiving yards_ and 9 touchdowns. He could have a strong game against the Texans’ secondary in Kansas City_ potentially scoring with a rushing and receiving touchdown.   Total Apex Fade of the Game  Hollywood Brown (5_700-DraftKings/6_000 Fanduel)  The Total Apex fade of the game will be Hollywood Brown of the Chiefs should be on the bench today. Brown this season despite injuries had 91 yards and no touchdowns. This season was a nightmare for him due to injuries and could have a weak game tonight. Houston could have coverages that could impact Brown heavily for their matchup today. With a hot Houston defense coming to Kansas_ fantasy players should avoid Hollywood today.  The NFL playoffs are getting hot for the divisional rounds_ and Saturday afternoon’s DFS game could help fantasy players win cash. Kansas City could have a strong game with fantasy players due to the weapons they have on offense_ including their run game. Along with the Chiefs’ run game_ the receiving core could do well with their veteran receivers today.  However_ the Chiefs offensive stars could suffer for fantasy players. There is also the Texans offense struggling horribly which could cost fantasy players money. Houston’s offense has been putrid with their offensive line struggling even during the win against the Chargers. Fantasy players could win easy cash prizes in this Saturday afternoon game of football. The NFL divisional games could be easy money because of the intensity of the playoffs and pressure from both teams.
281314458,TikTok said late Friday that its service would “go dark” for its 170 million American users on Sunday because of a ban in the United States over fears that its Chinese ownership poses a threat to national security.  The company said in a statement that “unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19” unless the Biden administration assures Apple_ Google and other companies that they would not be punished for delivering TikTok’s services in the United States.  The statement was TikTok’s latest attempt to pressure the administration to grant it a reprieve from a law_ upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday_ that would effectively ban its service starting Sunday.  The law says that app stores and major cloud computing providers cannot deliver TikTok to U.S. consumers unless the company is sold by its Chinese parent company_ ByteDance_ to a non-Chinese owner.

281332302,The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit on Friday accusing Walgreens of filling millions of unlawful opioid prescriptions.The civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Walgreen Boots Alliance_ Walgreen Co. and its various subsidiaries alleges the pharmacy giant knowingly filled millions of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances from approximately August 2012 through to the present. Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids_ the lawsuit said_ including early refills among other prescriptions. "Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful_ and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions_ including controlled substance prescriptions_ without taking the time needed to confirm their validity_" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton_ head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. "These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores." Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear "red flags_" the complaint alleges_ and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions_ including from its own pharmacists and internal data_ the suit claims.Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity_ the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions_ the statement said. Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands "behind our pharmacists_ dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve_ filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.""We look forward to the opportunity to defend the professionalism and integrity of our pharmacists_" the statement said.Last month the Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit against CVS_ alleging the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions with dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids_ agreed to fill opioid prescriptions early and made "trinity prescriptions_" which are a dangerous combination of drugs.Walgreens is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains_ with over 8_000 pharmacies across the U.S. Walgreens plans to close hundreds of stores by the end of 2025 to turn around its flagging sales_ and has already closed roughly 2_000 locations over the past decade_ the company said.
281319798,By LOLITA C. BALDOR  WASHINGTON (AP) — It is unclear who will take over at the Pentagon and the military services when the top leaders all step down Monday as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.  As of Friday_ officials said they had not yet heard who will become the acting defense secretary. Officials said the military chiefs of the Army_ Navy and Air Force were getting ready to step in as acting service secretaries — a rare move — because no civilians had been named or_ in some cases_ had turned down the opportunity.  As is customary_ all current political appointees will step down as of noon EST on Inauguration Day_ leaving hundreds of key defense posts open_ including dozens that require Senate confirmation. In addition to the top job and all three service secretaries_ all of their deputies and senior policy staff will leave.  The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to vote Monday on Trump’s choice to head the Defense Department_ Pete Hegseth_ but the full Senate vote may not happen until days later. As a result someone from the Biden administration would have to take over temporarily.  For the service secretaries_ officials said that while things could still change before the inauguration_ the Trump team is eyeing Gen. Randy George_ chief of staff of the Army_ to be that service’s temporary head. They said Gen. David Allvin_ chief of staff of the Air Force_ and Adm. Lisa Franchetti_ the Navy chief_ are aware they may have to step in if no civilian is named as acting secretary_ and they are preparing for that possibility.  The officials_ who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations_ said many senior Biden administration leaders are reluctant to serve in the incoming Trump administration because they are concerned about policy changes they may be required to handle or enforce.  Usually_ only people appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate serve as a defense or service secretary_ including in an acting capacity during a transition. Trump could pull a confirmed member of the Biden administration from another agency and put that person at the Pentagon.  Civilian control of the military is a key tenet_ but under the law the military chiefs of the services — who are all Senate confirmed — can take over on a temporary basis. It’s rare_ but did happen more than 30 years ago.  Arnold Punaro_ a retired Marine Corps Reserve two-star general_ said that in 1993_ Adm. Frank Kelso_ who was Navy chief_ was asked to serve as acting Navy secretary when Bill Clinton became president because civilian leaders did not step up.  “It doesn’t happen very often_” said Punaro_ who spent 14 years as a staff director on the Senate Armed Services Committee and has advised nominees through the confirmation process for decades. “Normally you don’t want the active-duty military serving in the civilian control positions. The practical reality is they are wearing both hats.”  The transition to a new secretary of defense has usually been an orderly process.  Four years ago_ the deputy secretary of defense under Trump_ David Norquist_ became acting secretary for the two-day gap between the inauguration of Democratic President Joe Biden and the Senate vote to confirm Lloyd Austin as Pentagon chief.  President Barack Obama asked his Republican predecessor’s defense secretary_ Robert Gates_ to stay on as his own Pentagon leader in 2009.  In 2017_ Jim Mattis_ Trump’s pick to be secretary during his first term_ was confirmed on Inauguration Day.  This year’s gap is further complicated by the fact that Trump and Hegseth have both pledged ro rid the Defense Department of what they call “woke” generals — or those who have supported diversity programs. That raises the possibility that even as the administration struggles to fill its political appointee slots_ it may also be carving holes in the military leadership structure that will have to be filled.  When Sen. Elissa Slotkin_ D-Mich._ asked Hegseth during his nomination hearing if he intended to fire the current Joint Chiefs chairman_ Gen. CQ Brown_ he answered_ “Senator_ every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy_ standards_ lethality_ and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.”  Hegseth previously said that Brown should be fired. Conservative groups have compiled lists of generals they believe should be fired for supporting diversity programs. If Brown is fired_ the vice chairman would take over until a new chairman is confirmed.  Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report.
281532812,Washington — TikTok voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. late Saturday night_ cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court_ but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.The court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S._ agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans. While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration_ the company itself took itself offline shortly before the midnight deadline on Sunday. Users in the U.S. who opened the app Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline_ "Sorry_ TikTok isn't available right now." "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S._" the message reads. "Unfortunately_ that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!"CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment. The app was no longer available in the Apple store as of 10:50 p.m. Eastern Time. On Friday_ TikTok said it would "be forced to go dark" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal "a stunt" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday_" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Even if President-elect Trump declines to enforce the ban_ the law would still be on the books_ and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to "save" TikTok_ and said Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done_ because it's appropriate_" he said in the phone interview_ adding_ "if I decide to do that_ I'll probably announce it on Monday."The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress. During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10_ Noel Francisco_ a lawyer for TikTok_ warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect_ explaining that it would be "extraordinarily difficult" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user. "As I understand it_ we go dark_" Francisco said. This is a developing story and will be updated.
281703472,Though President-elect Donald Trump had urged the US Supreme Court to delay deliberations on a challenge to that ban_ they issued a ruling on Friday upholding the law. Ninety minutes before its shutdown deadline on Saturday_ the app went dark_ replaced with a message that read_ “Sorry_ TikTok isn’t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately_ that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” That solution came sooner than expected_ it appears_ as the company tweeted Sunday that “In agreement with our service providers_ TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.” This is a breaking story_ please check back for updates.
281564216,The company announced the shutdown in a pop-up message on the app that only allows users to “learn more” about the federal law or close the app. The message says_ “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately_ that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!”  The app is also no longer available on the Google and Apple app stores. App providers risked massive fines of $5_000 a day per user if they kept offering the app.  TikTok previously told users at 9 p.m. about the looming shutdown in a pop-up message that said_ “We regret that a U.S. law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible_ and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned.”  Users at the time_ however_ could dismiss the message and continue scrolling through videos. The app was completely shut down around two hours later.  TikTok’s shutdown comes as the company warned on Friday that it would “go dark” unless the Biden administration “immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement” of a federal law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court requiring TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  The White House brushed off that threat of a service shutdown_ with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre calling it a “stunt.” Jean-Pierre advised that TikTok should work with the incoming Trump administration on the ban.   President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he’d “most likely” grant TikTok a 90-day extension to avoid a ban from U.S. app stores.
281512440,President-elect Donald Trump arrived in Washington Saturday to kick off days of pageantry heralding his second inauguration as president_ four years after he departed the city under the shadow of an attack by his supporters on the Capitol.His plane landed at Dulles Airport in the evening before he headed to Trump Sterling Golf Club.Earlier_ Trump_ Melania and their son Barron boarded the plane at 5:13 p.m. Eastern Time and departed Palm Beach_ Florida_ from Mar-a-Lago_ where his team has spent his transition since he won the election. The three of them turned around at the top of the stairs_ and Trump waved before heading inside the plane. The ritualistic changing of power will get underway as Washington's solemn pomp is paired with Trump's brand of party: a fireworks showcase at one of his luxury golf properties_ guests including tech industry titans_ friends from the business world and conservative media stars_ and thousands of his supporters streaming in from around the country.With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation's capital facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday's outdoor events_ including the swearing-in ceremony."There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country_" Trump wrote on Truth Social. "I don't want to see people hurt_ or injured_ in any way...Therefore_ I have ordered the Inauguration Address_ in addition to prayers and other speeches_ to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda_ as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985_ also because of very cold weather."Country music stars Carrie Underwood_ Billy Ray Cyrus and Jason Aldean_ disco band the Village People_ rapper Nelly and musician Kid Rock are all scheduled to perform at inauguration-related ceremonies and events. Actor Jon Voight and wrestler Hulk Hogan are also expected to make appearances_ as are a crew of Trump-embracing business executives: Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk_ Amazon founder Jeff Bezos_ Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.The only public event on Trump's schedule is an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling_ Virginia_ outside the city.While Trump holds court at his club_ Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.On Sunday_ the eve of his inauguration_ Trump is scheduled to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally will be followed by a private dinner.On Inauguration Day_ Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.Trump then heads to the Capitol_ where his ceremony has been moved indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years. It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda_ which holds only 600 people. More than 250_000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds.The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies_ which is responsible for planning the event_ said in a statement that "the vast majority of ticketed guests will not be able to attend the ceremonies in person."Eight years ago_ Trump's critics were wrestling with whether to attend his inauguration_ contemplating whether to buck long-standing practice and send a signal to the divisive new president. This year_ much outspoken resistance to Trump has faded away_ though there will be two notable absences: former first lady Michelle Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Neither gave an explanation as to why she was skipping the ceremony.After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address_ there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power_ Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts_ followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops.The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold_ with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will follow in the evening_ punctuated by musical performances.Trump's arrival in Washington will once again be accompanied by protests and vigils on issues such as abortion_ immigration rights and_ this time_ the Israel-Hamas war_ but the feel and the force of those demonstrations were different from the outset of his first term.The Women's March_ spurred by women outraged over Trump's win in 2017_ drew more than 500_000 people to Washington and millions more in cities around the country_ marking one of the largest single-day demonstrations in U.S. history.The march returned Saturday_ rebranded as the People's March_ with organizers saying their focus will be less on Trump and more on broader goals around women's and reproductive rights_ LGBTQ rights_ immigration_ climate and democracy. It drew far fewer than eight years ago.
281549642,DETROIT — Jayden Daniels threw for two touchdowns in a flawless performance by Washington’s dazzling rookie_ and the Commanders stunned the Detroit Lions 45-31 on Saturday night to reach the NFC championship game for the first time since winning the Super Bowl 33 years ago.  The sixth-seeded Commanders (14-5) were nearly double-digit underdogs against the Super Bowl favorite Lions (15-3) and overcame doubts as they did all season with a rookie quarterback_ new coach and general manager.  Detroit_ the NFC’s No. 1 seed for the first time_ doomed its chances by turning it over five times.  Washington rookie Mike Sainristil had two interceptions_ including one on a trick play with receiver Jameson Williams throwing into coverage off a reverse in the fourth quarter.   And Quan Martin returned a pick 40 yards for a touchdown.  Jared Goff threw three picks and lost a fumble_ turning it over three times in the ill-fated first half.  Daniels finished with 299 yards passing and 51 yards rushing_ and — just as important — didn’t turn the ball over.  First-year coach Dan Quinn led Washington to its first playoff win in 19 years last week.   The Commanders rallied past Tampa Bay for their sixth comeback win and fifth straight on the final play from scrimmage in regulation or overtime.  The Commanders_ who converted 3 of 4 fourth downs_ didn’t let Detroit keep it that close.  Washington outscored Detroit 28-14 in the second quarter — the highest-scoring quarter in NFL playoff history — to take a 31-21 lead at halftime.

281615956,A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip took effect on Sunday after a nearly three-hour delay_ pausing a 15-month-old war that has brought devastation and seismic political change to the Middle East.  Residents and a medical worker in Gaza said that they had heard no new fighting or military strikes since about half an hour before it was finally implemented.  Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians between 0630 GMT_ when the ceasefire was meant to begin_ and 0915 GMT_ when it actually took effect_ Palestinian medics said.  Israel blamed Hamas for the delay after the Palestinian militant group failed to provide a list naming the first three hostages to be released under the deal.  Hamas attributed the delay to “technical” reasons_ without specifying what those were.  A Palestinian official familiar with the matter_ speaking on condition of anonymity_ said the delay occurred because mediators had asked for 48 hours of “calm” before the ceasefire’s implementation_ but continued Israeli strikes right up until the deadline had made it difficult to send the list.  Two hours after the deadline_ Hamas said it had sent the list of names_ and Israeli officials confirmed receipt. Hamas named the hostages it was to release on Sunday as Romi Gonen_ Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari.  Israel did not immediately confirm the names.  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war_ which began after Hamas_ which controls the tiny coastal territory_ attacked Israel on Oct. 7_ 2023_ killing some 1_200 people_ according to Israeli authorities.  Israel’s response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47_000 Palestinians_ according to Gaza-based health authorities.  The war also set off a confrontation throughout the Middle East between Israel and its arch-foe Iran_ which backs Hamas and other anti-Israeli and anti-American paramilitary forces across the region.  Ahead of the ceasefire’s agreed implementation at 0630 GMT_ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.  Israeli military spokespeople said in separate statements on Sunday that their aircraft and artillery had attacked “ terror targets ”in northern and central Gaza_ and that the military would continue to attack the strip as long as Hamas did not meet its obligations under the ceasefire.  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said that at least 13 people were killed in the Israeli attacks and dozens wounded. Medics reported tanks firing at the Zeitoun area of Gaza City_ and said that an airstrike and tank fire also hit the northern town of Beit Hanoun_ sending residents who had returned there in anticipation of the ceasefire fleeing.  An air raid siren that sounded in the Sderot area of southern Irael had been a false alarm_ the Israeli military said in a separate statement.  Israeli forces had started withdrawing from areas in Gaza’s Rafah to the Philadelphi corridor along the border between Egypt and Gaza_ pro-Hamas media reported early on Sunday.  The three-stage ceasefire agreement followed months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egypt_ Qatar and the United States_ and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.  Its first stage will last six weeks_ during which 33 of the remaining 98 hostages – women_ children_ men over 50_ the ill and wounded – will be released in return for almost 2_000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.  They include 737 male_ female and teen-aged prisoners_ some of whom are members of militant groups convicted of attacks that killed dozens of Israelis_ as well as hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza in detention since the start of the war.  The first three are female hostages expected to be released through the Red Cross on Sunday. In return for each_ 30 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails are to be released.  Under the terms of the deal_ Hamas will inform the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) where the meeting point will be inside Gaza and the ICRC is expected to begin driving to that location to collect the hostages_ an official involved in the process told Reuters.  President Joe Biden’s team worked closely with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to push the deal over the line.  As his inauguration approached_ Trump had repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly_ warning repeatedly that there would be “hell to pay” if the hostages were not released.  But what will come next in Gaza remains unclear in the absence of a comprehensive agreement on the postwar future of the enclave_ which will require billions of dollars and years of work to rebuild.  And although the stated aim of the ceasefire is to end the war entirely_ it could easily unravel.  Hamas_ which has controlled Gaza for almost two decades_ has survived despite losing its top leadership and thousands of fighters.  Israel has vowed it will not allow Hamas to return to power and has cleared large stretches of ground inside Gaza_ in a step widely seen as a move towards creating a buffer zone that will allow its troops to act freely against threats in the enclave.  In Israel_ the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure that led to the deadliest single day in the country’s history.  The war sent shockwaves across the region_ triggering a conflict with the Tehran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement and bringing Israel into direct conflict with its arch-foe Iran for the first time.  It has also transformed the Middle East. Iran_ which spent billions building up a network of militant groups around Israel_ has seen its “Axis of Resistance” wrecked and was unable to inflict more than minimal damage on Israel in two major missile attacks.  Hezbollah_ whose huge missile arsenal was once seen as the biggest threat to Israel_ has seen its its top leadership killed and most of its missiles and military infrastructure destroyed.  On the diplomatic front_ Israel has faced outrage and isolation over the death and devastation in Gaza.  Netanyahu faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant on war crimes allegations and separate accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice.  Israel has reacted with fury to both cases_ rejecting the charges as politically motivated and accusing South Africa_ which brought the original ICJ case as well as the countries that have joined it_ of antisemitism.
281582146,The deadline for the start of a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip passed as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would not begin until Hamas provides the names of the three hostages it was set to release later Sunday in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners. The dispute had not been resolved when the deadline for the truce to begin passed at 8:30 a.m. local time. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari_ the top Israeli military spokesman_ said the army “continues to attack_ even now_ inside the Gaza arena_" and would until Hamas complies with the agreement. Meanwhile_ Israel announced that it had recovered the body of Oron Shaul_ a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war_ in a special operation. The bodies of Shaul and another soldier_ Hadar Goldin_ remained in Gaza after the 2014 war and had not been returned despite a public campaign by their families. Netanyahu said he had instructed the military that the cease-fire “will not begin until Israel has in its possession the list of hostages to be freed_ which Hamas committed to provide.” He had issued a similar warning the night before. Hamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on “technical field reasons.” The militant group said in a statement that it is committed to the cease-fire agreement announced last week. The planned cease-fire_ agreed upon after a year of intensive mediation by the United States_ Qatar and Egypt_ is the first step in a long and fragile process aimed at winding down the 15-month war. The 42-day first phase of the cease-fire should see a total of 33 hostages returned from the Gaza Strip and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. Israeli forces should pull back into a buffer zone inside Gaza_ and many displaced Palestinians should be able to return home. The devastated territory should also see a surge in humanitarian aid. This is just the second cease-fire in the war_ longer and more consequential than the weeklong pause more than a year ago_ with the potential to end the fighting for good. Negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of this cease-fire should begin in just over two weeks. Major questions remain_ including whether the war will resume after the six-week first phase and how the rest of the nearly 100 hostages in Gaza will be freed. Dozens of people took to the streets in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Yunis to celebrate the cease-fire_ according to an Associated Press reporter. Four masked and armed Hamas fighters arrived in two vehicles as the celebrations were underway_ with people welcoming them and chanting slogans in support of the militant group. The Hamas-run police began deploying in public after mostly lying low for months due to Israeli airstrikes. Gaza City residents said they had seen them operating in parts of the city_ and the AP reporter in Khan Yunis saw a small number out on the streets. Palestinian residents began returning to their homes in parts of Gaza City early Sunday_ even as tank shelling continued overnight to the east_ closer to the Israeli border. Families could be seen making their way back on foot with their belongings loaded on donkey carts_ residents said. “The sound of shelling and explosions didn’t stop_” said Ahmed Matter_ a Gaza City resident. He said he saw many families leaving their shelters and returning to their homes. “People are impatient. They want this madness to end." Israel’s Cabinet approved the cease-fire early Saturday in a rare session during the Jewish Sabbath_ more than two days after mediators announced the deal. Israel and Hamas were under pressure from the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump's team to achieve a deal before the presidential inauguration on Monday. The toll of the war has been immense_ and new details on its scope will soon emerge. More than 46_000 Palestinians have been killed_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll_ but says at least half of the dead are women and children. The Oct. 7_ 2023_ a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war killed over 1_200 people_ mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died. Some 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The United Nations says the health system_ road network and other vital infrastructure have been badly damaged. Rebuilding — if the cease-fire reaches its final phase — will take several years at least. Major questions about Gaza’s future_ political and otherwise_ remain unresolved. Shurafa_ Magdy and Goldenberg write for the Associated Press and reported from Deir al Balah_ Cairo and Tel Aviv_ respectively. Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

281986652,Ivanka Trump looked effortlessly chic in an all-green outfit as she arrived ahead of father Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday morning.  The President-elect’s eldest daughter was seen in the deep forest green ensemble as she arrived at the service at St. John’s Church_ as Trump prepares for his second presidential term.  Ivanka looked stunning in a simple yet eye-catching outfit_ wearing a woolen pencil skirt with matching blazer.  The gorgeous jacket was structured around the body_ cinched at the waist with a thin black leather belt. It also featured a chic A-symmetrical element_ with the right-side lapel sweeping down in a waterfall style.  She accessorized with a beret style hat in the same shade_ black high heels_ sheer black tights and leather gloves.  Ivanka wore her hair in a stylish French twist_ and kept her makeup simple_ adding pearl earrings.  The 43-year-old had a stunning Dior bag on her arm_ which appeared to be the Lady Dior Bag in Black Cannage Grained Calfskin with gold finishes_ which retails for $5_900.  Her three children_ whom she shares with husband Jared Kushner_ were also dressed for the occasion.  Daughter Arabella_ 13_ appears to be following in her mother’s stylish footsteps_ wearing a beige ensemble which included a cape and a belt with matching gloves_ which completed her long ark hair which she wore out.  Her sons Joseph_ 11_ and Theodore_ eight_ both wore navy blue suits.  Last night_ Ivanka stunned in an Oscar de la Renta gown at a candlelight dinner at the National Building Museum in Washington_ D.C.  The mother-of-three wore the custom off-shoulder_ crystal-and-pearl_ floral-embroidered empire waist gown with a silver stole to the event_ where she was seen rubbing shoulders with Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.  Ivanka won’t be resuming the same responsibilities as last time her father was in office_ previously stating she wants to be his emotional support this time around.  Instead_ she hopes to just be her father’s emotional support person during this presidential cycle.  ‘I hate politics_’ she confessed. ‘I went through years of craziness.’  ‘It’s the world’s loneliest position_ the enormity of the decisions you’re making on a daily basis_ how transactional everyone is with you.’  However_ Ivanka speaks to her father nearly every day and is likely to be an influence behind-the-scenes even without a formal title.  ‘I’m most looking forward to just being able to show up for him as a daughter and be there for him_ to take his mind off things and like watch a movie with him or watch a sports game_ to know that he can be with me and be himself_ and just relax.’   Ivanka was not involved in her father’s 2024 presidential campaign. It was a stark contrast to the 2020 race_ where she was a regular presence at his rallies.  The dedicated mom said said the main reason she’s not returning to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is her children Arabella_ Joseph And Theodore.  ‘The main reason I am not going back to serve now is_ I know the cost. And it’s a price that I’m not willing to make my kids bear_’ she said.  ‘My primary goals were just to like_ be the best freaking mom_’ she said.  ‘Every time I had to miss something_ I’m like_ I will never let this happen again in the minute I leave the White House.’
281825688,Jan. 20 (UPI) -- Incoming first lady Melania Trump has launched her own cryptocurrency on the eve of her husband_ President-elect Donald Trump_ being inaugurated and days after he announced his own memecoin.  A memcoin is a cryptocurrency inspired by Internet memes_ characters or trends_ according to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase_ which said such currencies are often propped up by online supporters and are generally intended for entertainment.  Melania Trump announced her cryptocurrency in a social media post.  "The Official Melania Meme is Live_" she said. "You can buy $MELANIA now."  The announcement follows Donald Trump on Friday announcing his $TRUMP memecoin.  "It's time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING_" the incoming-president said in a post published to social media platforms_ including his own Truth Social. "Join my very special Trump Community."  Both websites attached to the coins state they each are "digital collectibles intended to function as an expression of support for and engagement with" the values connected with the brands MELANIA and $TRUMP.  Both also state that they are not intended to be an investment opportunity or security.  After Trump announced his memecoin on Friday_ it was condemned by ethics lawyers who accused the incoming president of profiteering from his position in the White House.  "It is literally cashing in on the presidency -- creating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the president's family in connection with his office_" Campaign Legal Center Executive Director Adav Noti told The New York TImes.  "It is beyond unprecedented."  Despite previously being a skeptic of cryptocurrency_ Trump and his family embraced the digital currency during his 2024 campaign_ and he is now ushering in what some analysts have described as a crypto-friendly Cabinet.  Early last month_ Trump named venture capitalist and Elon Musk associate David Sacks to be his so-called artificial intelligence and crypto czar.

281995380,Cecile Richards_ a prominent advocate for women's rights and other progressive causes_ died Monday. In a statement_ her family confirmed her death_ saying she passed away at home_ "surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog_ Ollie."   "Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives_" the statement said.   Richards was best known for her work leading Planned Parenthood through a particularly challenging time which included threats to its funding and the first election of Donald Trump to the presidency.  During more than a decade at the helm of Planned Parenthood_ Richards was often called upon to defend the reproductive health organization against attacks from political opponents. She and her movement faced mounting challenges after Trump_ who ran for President in 2016 on a promise to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade_ was first elected.  At the Women's March in Washington the day after Trump's inauguration in 2017_ Richards addressed thousands of marchers and promised to fight his policies.  "Today we're here to deliver a message: we're not gonna take this lying down_ and we will not go back_" Richards told the crowd.  The next year_ Richards announced she was leaving Planned Parenthood. After leaving the organization_ Richards focused her efforts on leading Supermajority_ a group she'd co-founded to mobilize female voters.  In the years to come_ the Trump administration would take steps designed to reduce access to abortion_ including cutting off funds for groups that make abortion referrals_ like Planned Parenthood_ through an overhaul of the Title X family planning program.  Over the course of his first term_ Trump named three conservative justices to the Supreme Court_ who_ in June of 2022_ would ultimately vote to overturn decades of abortion-rights precedent.  Despite setbacks for the abortion rights movement and a diagnosis of brain cancer_ Richards embodied an "indefatigable" determination_ says former Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis.  "Her belief [was] you can't give up before you even start_ and that it's always worth a fight_" Davis said.  Davis worked closely with Richards during a high-profile battle to defeat an anti-abortion bill in Texas in 2013. Now a senior advisor to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes_ the group's political arm in Texas_ Davis says Richards still inspires her to keep fighting.  "You want to give in to the weariness and give in to just giving up_" Davis said. "When I'm tempted to feel that way_ I think about Cecile_ and I know a lot of people do."  Richards herself drew inspiration from the legacy of her mother_ the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards_ who was known for her sharp wit and down-to-earth demeanor.  During a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2015_ a male lawmaker asked her if she expected the committee "to be easier on you because you're a woman?"  "Absolutely not_" Richards responded. "That's not how my mama raised me."  The hearing stemmed from the release of secretly-recorded videos by the Center for Medical Progress_ an anti-abortion group that accused Planned Parenthood of selling fetal body parts. Planned Parenthood said the sting videos were edited to be deliberately misleading.  Dr. Colleen McNicholas_ Chief Medical Officer at Planned Parenthood Great Rivers in the St. Louis area_ knew Richards for more than a decade through their advocacy for abortion rights.  "I think she really changed the way that the movement engaged publicly; she was a very visible and bold presence_" McNicholas says. "She wasn't afraid to take questions_ to say the word 'abortion.'"  Washington Sen. Patty Murray_ a Democrat with a long history of advocacy for reproductive rights_ credits Richards with an instrumental role in making sure the Affordable Care Act_ which passed under President Barack Obama_ included contraceptive coverage.  Murray says despite the setbacks the movement has faced in recent years_ she sees Richards as an example of continuing to fight.  "I would take what Cecile has done in her lifetime and use it as a charge to all of us now: you move forward_ you fight for what you believe in_ you have the courage to stand up and say what is right_" Murray says. "You take those setbacks_ learn from them_ and move forward_ and she's always done that."  In an Instagram post in January 2024_ months after her cancer diagnosis_ Richards described going through a whirlwind of treatments_ time with family_ and focusing on what was most important — including her continued activism.  "After all_" Richards wrote_ "as my mother used to say: 'Why should your life be just about you?'"  As her health continued to decline_ Richards addressed the 2024 Democratic National Convention.  She spoke of the joy of recently becoming a grandmother_ and the challenges many women have faced since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  "One day_ our children and grandchildren may ask us_ 'When it was all on the line_ what did you do?' And the only acceptable answer is_ everything we could_" Richards said.  In November 2024_ President Joe Biden honored Cecile Richards with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a private ceremony at the White House. In a statement_ Biden praised Richards for her "absolute courage and conviction" and "an inspiring legacy that endures in her incredible family_ the countless lives she has made better_ and a Nation seeking the light of equality_ justice_ and freedom."
281955710,President Joe Biden has taken a stand in his final hours as president ahead of President-Elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on Monday_ Jan. 20.    Early Monday morning_ Biden issued a series of preemptive pardons for several high-profile figures whom Trump has publicly spoken out against. These pardons cannot be undone by the incoming administration.    Some of those preemptive pardons include Dr. Anthony Fauci_ the former chief medical advisor to the president_ who served amidst the COVID pandemic as well as General Mark A. Milley_ the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was appointed by Trump in 2019 during his first administration.    Trump and Milley became at odds after Milley disagreed with Trump’s desire to overturn the results of the 2020 election_ referring to the situation as “a Reichstag moment_” according to the 2021 book I Alone Can Fix It by journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.   Others who made it onto Biden's list of presidential pardons included members who served on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol_ including former Representative Liz Cheney_ Senator Adam Schiff_ former Representative Adam Kinzinger as well as Capitol and Washington D.C. police who testified.    The decision is viewed as a guard against any acts of potential revenge from the incoming Trump administration.    “Our nation relies on dedicated selfless public servants every day_” Biden shared in a statement explaining his preemptive pardons. “They are the lifeblood of our democracy yet alarmingly public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.”   “These pardons should not be mistaken that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing. Nor should acceptance by them be misconstrued as any admission of guilt for any offense_" Biden clarified. "Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”    Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.   The pardons come after Trump has spoken out against many of the individuals. In 2023_ he accused Milley of going behind his back in the final days of the first Trump administration and calling Chinese counterparts.    “[Milley] was actually dealing with China to give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States_” Trump wrote in the post on his Truth Social site at the time. “This is an act so egregious that_ in times gone by_ the punishment would have been death!”   General Milley released a statement regarding the pardon_ saying he was "deeply grateful" to President Biden_ and adding that he_ "does not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me in this life_ fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights."   In December 2024_ Trump told NBC News’ Laura Jarrett that the members of the Jan. 6 committee deserved jail time.    “For what they did_ honestly_ they should go to jail_” Trump said during the interview.    When asked if Cheney should go to jail_ he replied_ “I think everybody on the committee_ anybody that voted in favor [should go to jail].”   Despite this_ Trump also said he had no plans to direct his FBI director or Attorney General to send them to jail.

281936576,By COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLER  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci_ retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol_ using the extraordinary powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential “revenge” by the incoming Trump administration.  The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6_ 2021. Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.  “The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing_ nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense_” Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”  It’s customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term_ but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit admission of guilt or wrongdoing_ even though those who have been pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes.  “These are exceptional circumstances_ and I cannot in good conscience do nothing_” Biden said_ adding that “Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated_ the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”  Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40 years and was Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement in 2022. He helped coordinate the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised the ire of Trump when he refused to back Trump’s unfounded claims. He has become a target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right_ who blame him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their rights_ even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying.  Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the deadly Jan. 6_ 2021_ insurrection.  Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6 committee_ including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger_ both Republicans_ as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the committee.  Biden_ an institutionalist_ has promised a smooth transition to the next administration_ inviting Trump to the White House and saying that the nation will be OK_ even as he warned during his farewell address of a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump’s ascension to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by those concerns.  Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the sentences of almost 2_500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row_ converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump_ an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment_ takes office. In his first term_ Trump presided over an unprecedented spate of executions_ 13_ in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.
281813994,Dear Readers: Wishing you all a very happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Inauguration Day!  I thought it would be a good time to find some impactful quotes from presidential inaugural speeches and from King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. I found quotes that inspire_ unify and motivate audiences toward a shared vision for the nation. Comparing King’s speech with specific inaugural addresses reveals common themes of leadership_ resilience and building an even better future for all of us.  “I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted_ every hill and mountain shall be made low_ the rough places will be made plain_ and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed_ and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith_ we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith_ we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith_ we will be able to work together_ to pray together_ to struggle together_ to go to jail together_ to climb up for freedom together_ knowing that we will be free one day.” -- Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech  “Let us_ then_ fellow citizens_ unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that_ having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered_ we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic_ as wicked_ and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.” -- Thomas Jefferson_ March 4_ 1801.  “With malice toward none_ with charity for all_ with firmness in the right_ as God gives us to see the right_ let us strive on to finish the work we are in_ to bind up the nation’s wounds.” -- Abraham Lincoln_ March 4_ 1865.  “Much has been given us_ and much will rightfully be expected from us. We have duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk neither.” -- Theodore Roosevelt_ March 4_ 1905.  “We have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world.” -- Herbert Hoover_ March 4_ 1929.  “This great nation will endure as it has endured_ will revive and will prosper. So_ first of all_ let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” -- Franklin D. Roosevelt_ March 4_ 1933.  “My fellow Americans: Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: Ask not what America will do for you_ but what together we can do for the freedom of man.” -- John F. Kennedy_ Jan. 20_ 1961.  “We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them_ reach out a hand when they fall_ heal them when they’re sick_ and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?” -- Ronald Reagan_ Jan. 20_ 1981.  “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.” -- Bill Clinton_ Jan. 20_ 1993.

282013776,Sen. John Fetterman arrived at the Capitol for President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration in a black hoodie_ gray shorts and sneakers — staying true to his traditional fashion style_ despite the freezing temp.  Everyone else has arrived in formal attire.  As dignitaries filed into the Capitol Rotunda_ the freshman senator from Pennsylvania was spotted luxuriating in the front row of the audience_ legs comfortably outstretched.  Fetterman met with Trump last week at Mar-a-Lago and has signaled openness to supporting a number of his administration staffing picks.  Fetterman has donned a proper suit in the past_ including when presiding over the Senate for votes_ in keeping with the upper chamber’s policies.   He’s also been seen wearing his tuxedo hoodie in the past_ including at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner last year.
282039110,By STEVE PEOPLES_ NICHOLAS RICCARDI and BILL BARROW  NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second inaugural address featured similar themes to his first: a sweeping indictment of the country he inherits and grand promises to fix its problems.  Eight years ago_ Trump described “American carnage” and promised to end it immediately. On Monday_ he declared that the country’s “decline” will end immediately_ ushering in “the golden age of America.”  Trump added a long list of policies that sounded more like a State of the Union speech than an Inauguration Day speech. But the broad themes were fundamentally Trumpian_ setting himself up as a national savior.  Breaking tradition_ the Republican president delivered his remarks from inside the Capitol Rotunda due to the bitter cold outside. He spoke to several hundred elected officials and pro-Trump VIPs_ tech titan Elon Musk among them.  Here are some takeaways from the speech:  A promise of an American ‘golden age’  From the start_ Trump’s speech tracked his campaign rally approach: big promises of national success due to his leadership_ with plenty of sweeping indictments of the status quo.  “The golden age of America begins right now_” Trump said after ticking through the requisite nods to former presidents and other dignitaries. He added several more hyperbolic but nebulous promises: The ”start of a thrilling new era.” A nation “greater_ stronger and far more exceptional than ever before.”  “Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced_” he continued. “Our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud_ prosperous and free.”  The underlying presumption_ of course_ is that Trump is inheriting what he called throughout the 2024 campaign “a failed nation.”  He vowed to fulfill campaign promises to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border_ boost domestic oil production and impose tariffs to “enrich our citizens.”  Trump calls America’s past leadership corrupt  Trump described America’s leadership over the last four years as incompetent and corrupt_ echoing some of the darker rhetoric he promoted on a daily basis as a presidential candidate on the campaign trail.  “We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home_ while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad_” Trump charged.  He said the current government protects dangerous immigrants instead of law-abiding citizens_ protects foreign borders at the expense of American borders and “can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency.”  And_ as he often does_ Trump cast him self as uniquely positioned to fix it all.  “All of this will change starting today_ and it will change very quickly_” he said.  As of Monday_ Republicans control all three branches of the federal government.  Recasting his assassination attempt  Trump mentioned the attempt to assassinate him in Butler_ Pennsylvania_ using striking language to describe how he survived.  “I was saved by God to make America great again_” Trump said to applause.  The shooter was an apparently disturbed 20-year-old local man. Trump baselessly implied the attack was part of a conspiracy to stop him from returning to office.  Lying about wildfires  Trump’s lament about the state of the nation included disbelief that the fires around Los Angeles were still burning “without a token defense.”  That’s false. Firefighters have been battling the blazes since they erupted and have made significant progress. The Eaton fire is 87% contained_ and the Palisades fire 59% contained_ according to CalFire.  A different scene indoors  Inaugural speeches are traditionally delivered on the National Mall in front of tens of thousands of cheering supporters_ many of them average voters from across America_ who traveled great distance to witness history in person.  Not this one.  Trump delivered his speech in front of a crowd estimated at only around 600 in the Capitol Rotunda_ which was limited to members of Congress_ Cabinet nominees_ Trump’s family_ business leaders and political VIPs. In fact_ a collection of tech titans_ led by Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos_ were positioned in front of Cabinet members in some cases. And while the business leaders were allowed to bring their spouses_ members of Congress were not. Thousands of his supporters watched a broadcast of the swearing-in at Capitol One Arena instead.  It’s noteworthy that four years ago_ violent Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol Rotunda as members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence feared for their lives. Pence attended Monday_ though his wife_ former second lady Karen Pence_ did not.  Riccardi reported from Denver_ and Barrow reported from Atlanta.
282169442,ATLANTA (AP) — Instead of crying over another collapse_ Ohio State can celebrate another national title after holding off a Notre Dame comeback bid Monday night to walk away with a nailbiter of a 34-23 victory over the Fighting Irish.  Will Howard hit big-play receiver Jeremiah Smith for 56 yards on a late third-and-11 to lock down a game that had been a laugher_ then turned into something else.  Trailing 31-7_ Notre Dame scored two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions to make it a one-score game late in the fourth quarter.  The Irish stopped Ohio State on the first two plays of the next drive and used their timeouts. But on third down_ Howard found Smith in single coverage on the right sideline and dropped his best pass of the season into the hands of the second-team All-American.  It set up a field goal that started the celebration in earnest_ closing out a seven-week climb from the depths of a loss to 20-point underdog Michigan to the top of college football. Ohio State will bring its sixth “natty” and first since the 2014 season back to the Horseshoe in Columbus.  Howard_ a transfer-portal success story from Kansas State_ threw for 231 yards and two scores_ but nothing will beat the pass to Smith with everything on the line.  The receiver_ who had been bottled up by Texas in the semifinals then fairly quiet for most of this game_ finally got loose for the kind of play he’s been making all year. He finished with five catches for 88 yards.  Ohio State scored touchdowns on its first four possessions_ then added a field goal on its fifth.  When Quinshon Judkins (100 yards_ 11 carries_ three TDs)_ a transfer from Mississippi who highlighted Ohio State’s judicious use of the ever-growing portal_ busted a 70-yard run to set up the score that made it 28-7_ this game looked over.  By Eddie Pells of the Associated Press.
282137928,Washington — President Trump on Monday granted clemency to roughly 1_500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes on Jan. 6_ 2021_ following through on his longtime promise to absolve those who participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol of wrongdoing.The president's action comes on his first day back in the White House and just hours after he was sworn in for a second term. Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the events of Jan. 6_ when a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming former President Biden's victory over him in 2020. And the pardons further his efforts to recast the assault as a "day of love" and Jan. 6 defendants as "political prisoners" and "hostages.""These are the hostages_ approximately 1_500 for a pardon_ full pardon_" Mr. Trump said during remarks from the Oval Office. "This is a big one."The president said he hopes those who remain incarcerated will be released tonight. His clemency includes six commutations_ he said_ though the proclamation released by the White House lists the names of 14 people and reduces their sentences to time served."These people have been destroyed_" he said. "What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in the history of our country."Mr. Trump lambasted the judges overseeing cases stemming from the Jan. 6 attack and the prosecutors who brought charges as "brutal."The proclamation signed by the president states that it "ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation."More than 1_600 people have been charged as a result of their alleged conduct on Jan. 6_ and at least 1_100 have had their cases adjudicated and received sentences_ according to the Justice Department. More than 700 defendants have completed their sentences or did not receive sentences of incarceration.More than 170 people have been accused of using a deadly or dangerous weapon_ such as a fire extinguisher or bear spray_ against police officers_ prosecutors have said.There are roughly 300 prosecutions that remain pending against defendants who have been charged_ the Justice Department said earlier this month. Nearly 60% of those have been charged with assaulting_ resisting_ or impeding law enforcement or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder_ which are felonies.Mr. Trump's proclamation directs the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments against those facing charges related to events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack. Many Jan. 6 defendants were charged with nonviolent misdemeanors_ though some faced more serious offenses_ like conspiring to use force to resist the transfer of power. But Mr. Trump's action appears to be sweeping — among those expected to receive clemency is Enrique Tarrio_ the former head of the far-right group the Proud Boys who was serving a 22-year sentence after he was convicted in May 2023 of charges including seditious conspiracy_ his lawyer Nayid Hassan told CBS News. It's unclear whether he will receive a pardon or have his sentence commuted. Mr. Trump suggested after he was inaugurated that he would offer reprieves to those convicted as a result of Jan. 6_ telling a crowd of supporters assembled at Emancipation Hall in the Capitol that they were "going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages."The pardons cap a remarkable sequence of events that has played out in the wake of the 2020 election_ when Mr. Trump mounted a scheme to overturn its results to hold onto power for a second term_ as alleged by federal prosecutors and House investigators.That plot culminated in the Jan. 6 attack_ as investigators said the president had spent weeks sowing doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election and urged his supporters in a speech outside the White House on Jan. 6 to "fight like hell" and "stop the steal."The Justice Department has said more than 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot at the Capitol. The losses suffered as a result of the riot_ including damage to the building and grounds_ exceeded $2.8 million_ according to the department. But four years after Mr. Trump allegedly attempted to subvert the transfer of power_ he has returned to the White House after defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris. In one of her final acts as vice president_ she presided over the joint session this year that confirmed Mr. Trump's victory.With Mr. Trump's repeated promise to grant a reprieve for those charged in connection with the Capitol attack_ several defendants sought to have court action in their cases delayed in the wake of the election_ though unsuccessfully for some. Others have been allowed by the judges overseeing their cases to attend Mr. Trump's inauguration in Washington.The authority to issue pardons for federal offenses rests exclusively with the president under the Constitution_ but presidents typically work with the Justice Department's pardon attorney to consider requests for clemency. It's unclear how Mr. Trump and his new administration decided who received pardons.Pam Bondi_ the president's pick for attorney general_ was asked during her confirmation hearing last week whether she believes Jan. 6 defendants who were convicted of assaulting law enforcement should be given clemency_ and said she would review each case and advise "on a case-by-case basis" if asked by the president to do so."I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country_" she said.Mr. Trump's decision is likely to stir anger from police officers who were injured during the Jan. 6 attack and testified before the House select committee that investigated the riot in 2022_ as well as committee members themselves_ some of whom are no longer in Congress.Meanwhile_ judges on the federal district court in Washington_ where the cases involving Jan. 6 have been brought_ have continued to resist efforts to lessen the severity of what transpired more than four years ago in the eyes of the public."No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending_ the true story of what happened on January 6_ 2021 will never change_" Senior Judge Royce Lamberth_ who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan_ said during a December sentencing. Lamberth said that "just as the president must make decisions on matters of clemency without interference from the coordinate branches_ so too must our judiciary independently administer the laws and sentence convicted offenders."Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked those who investigated the Jan. 6 assault and threatened to punish his political opponents_ including former special counsel Jack Smith and the lawmakers who were on the House select committee that investigated the attack.In anticipation of possible retribution by Mr. Trump_ Biden preemptively pardoned members of the Jan. 6 select committee and its staff_ as well as Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the panel_ during his final hours in office.
282137322,President Trump signed an executive order on Monday to delay enforcing a federal ban of TikTok for at least 75 days_ even though the law took effect on Sunday and it is unclear that such a move could override it.  The order_ one of Mr. Trump’s first acts after taking office_ instructs the attorney general not to take any action to enforce the law so that his administration has “an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.”   The order could immediately face legal challenges_ including over whether a president has the power to halt enforcement of a federal law. Companies subject to the law may determine that the order does not provide a shield from legal liability.  The federal law banning TikTok_ which is owned by China’s ByteDance_ mandated that the app needed to be sold to a non-Chinese owner or it would be blocked. The law allows a president to grant a 90-day extension if a buyer is found_ but only if there is “significant progress” on a deal that can be completed within that period. It is not clear that the extension is available_ given that the law is already in effect.
282241214,The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) late Monday night launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its new executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or hold temporary visas_ such as work_ student_ or tourist visas.President Donald Trump's order contradicts the Constitution_ which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States_ irrespective of their parents' immigration status.The ACLU lawsuit_ filed in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire_ was filed on behalf of clients whose babies born on U.S. soil will be denied citizenship under the order. This marks the first of many expected legal challenges Trump may face during his new second term following his early executive actions.The order_ signed by President Trump on Monday_ seeks to exclude children of non-permanent residents from automatically receiving U.S. citizenship. Although Trump made similar threats during his first term_ he did not implement them.What Can One Expect From The New OrderThe new executive order aims to reverse the 14th Amendment_ under which any person born within the territory of the U.S. is an American citizen.Under the new executive order_ babies born 30 days after the effective date will not be U.S. citizens if their mother was living undocumented or temporarily in the country and their father was not a U.S. citizen or resident. However_ babies born before the order and children with at least one U.S. citizen or resident parent will retain or be eligible for U.S. citizenship.The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution hasn't outlined strict policies on who can be a U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court has even specifically ruled that being born on U.S. soil alone makes you a U.S. citizen_ irrespective of your parents' immigration status.So_ arguments are running high that Trump's order is an outright violation of the 14th Amendment."Denying citizenship to U.S.-born children is not only unconstitutional — it's also a reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values. Birthright citizenship is part of what makes the United States the strong and dynamic nation that it is. This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history_ by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the U.S. who are denied full rights as Americans._" Anthony D. Romero_ executive director of the ACLU_ said in a statement."We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail."A Trump administration official hinted at potential limitations of the order_ stating that it would be applied on a "prospective basis_" meaning it will only affect people or situations that arise after the order is issued and will not affect people or situations that existed prior to its implementation.There has been a notable decline in the number of children born to parents in the U.S. without legal status.According to the Pew Research Center_ 1.3 million U.S.-born adults are children of unauthorized immigrants_ according to 2022 data_ the latest available.However_ immigrant rights advocates worry that Trump's new order could affect the next generation. By 2050_ an estimated 4.7 million children could have one or both parents without legal status under current policies_ according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.
282144592,President Trump is making good on his pre-election pledge to withdraw from the World Health Organization. In one of many orders issued after his inauguration_ he announced the start of the process for terminating U.S. membership in the U.N. agency that oversees global health issues.   Trump's frustration with WHO goes back to the height of the COVID era. He's repeatedly criticized the organization for being too slow to respond to the pandemic and being "owned and controlled by China."  "World Health ripped us off_" Trump said during an extended_ relaxed discussion with reporters as he signed executive actions.  It will take a year for Trump's pledge to become official. That's the time frame the U.S. set for any future withdrawal when it joined the global health body in 1948. In Trump's first term_ he halted funding to WHO and initiated the process of withdrawing. But before the one-year mark had been reached_ Biden took office and reversed course immediately.  The consequences of Monday's announcement for WHO are significant. They'd lose arguably their most important member — and their biggest donor by far. The U.S. gave $1.284 billion to WHO during 2022 and 2023 – hundreds of millions of dollars more than Germany_ the second-place donor.  Critics of Trump's call believe that the U.S. will also face consequences. WHO monitors global health threats_ evaluates new vaccines and medications_ coordinates the response to emerging health crises as well as ongoing issues and provides expert support to countries_ particularly when they face a health emergency – among other things. The U.S. would lose easy access to critical data on outbreaks and a seat at the table when health standards are set and disease responses are decided.  "This is the most cataclysmic decision_" says Lawrence Gostin_ professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of WHO's Center on Global Health Law. "[This is] a grave wound to American national interests and our national security. This will really leave our agencies – like the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and NIH [National Institutes of Health] flying blind."  Elisha Dunn-Georgiou — president and CEO of the Global Health Council_ a nonpartisan group that advocates for global health – said withdrawing is "really bad for the U.S. [in terms of] access to data_ to surveillance_ to being at the table negotiating and holding other countries accountable when there is an epidemic or pandemic."  Speaking to NPR last week about the prospect of withdrawal_ she said: "Other countries with a lot of power — China_ Russia — other powers that want to shape the WHO_ would take [this] opportunity to do so."  Brett Schaefer — a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation — said there are other ways the Trump Administration can lead in the global health arena after leaving WHO.  "There's hardly a lack of precedent for maybe addressing pandemic issues outside of the WHO_" he said_ speaking to NPR before the announcement was made. "There's a reason why UNAIDS exists_ and there's a reason why GAVI [The Vaccine Alliance] exists_ and there's a reason why the Global Fund exists — and that's because the WHO has_ in the past_ not been seen as either the most effective or the most responsive vehicle for addressing various international health concerns."
282395276,Garth Hudson_ the majestic keyboard_ saxophone and accordion player and last surviving member of The Band_ died Tuesday. He was 87.   Hudson died in his sleep at a nursing home in Woodstock_ New York_ his estate executor told The Toronto Star.   The Canadian musician and his mates Robbie Robertson_ Levon Helm_ Rick Danko and Richard Manuel backed up Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan before striking out on their own. They perfected a style that combined American roots music_ country_ blues_ R&B_ gospel_ rockabilly and — courtesy of Hudson — tenor sax and organ dirges.   One of many highlights of a Band concert was the bearded Hudson as mad genius performing an organ solo and a standard improvised introduction to “Chest Fever_” from their seminal 1968 debut album Music From Big Pink. The tune_ written by Robertson and echoing Bach with its classical overtones_ opened their Woodstock set in 1969.   “Where most rock organists 15 years ago were infusing their organ work with the razzle-dazzle of gospel_ Hudson cultivated a more pastoral sound_” Keyboard magazine wrote in 1983. “Unlike Billy Preston_ Felix Cavaliere_ Alan Price and in a different sense_ Ray Manzarek and Doug Ingle_ Hudson worked in the background_ letting the rhythm instruments and vocalists in The Band stand in the footlights while he spun his intricate musical webs so deeply into the fabric of each song that it was almost impossible to separately identify the keyboard parts at all.”   Eric Garth Hudson on born on Aug. 2_ 1937_ in Windsor_ Ontario. His parents_ former World War I fighter pilot Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland_ played instruments.   The family moved in 1940 to London_ Ontario_ and Hudson attended Broughdale Public School_ Medway High School and the University of Western Ontario. Along the way_ he studied classical piano and played the organ at St. Luke’s Anglican Church and at an uncle’s funeral parlor.   As rock ‘n’ roll was taking off in the late 1950s_ Hudson performed with dance bands and began a three-year stint as a member of Paul London & the Capers in 1958.   Robertson had already moved from his home in Toronto to Arkansas to hook up with Hawkins’ backup band_ and in his 2016 memoir_ Testimony_ he recalled pitching the rockabilly barnstormer on having Hudson come aboard.   “You remember Garth Hudson? Well_ I talked with him and besides being a really skillful musician_ he’s a fascinating and unusual guy_” Robertson wrote. “He mentioned this new gizmo that hooks up to a piano and sounds like an organ. It would make us sound twice as big.”   He also mentioned that Hudson played various saxophones. “Yeah_ to have an organ and horns_ that would be a big sound_” Hawkins said.   However_ it did take some convincing for Hudson_ then 24_ to leave his parents’ home. The clincher_ Robertson recalled_ was that Hudson got an additional $10 a week to give music lessons to his bandmates. (That assuaged his folks_ who feared their son was squandering his education.)   “Just having Garth as a teacher was an honor_” Helm wrote in his 1993 memoir_ This Wheel’s on Fire_ saying he learned a great deal about chord structures and harmonies from Hudson.   “He’d listen to a song on the radio in the Cadillac and tell us the chords as it went along_” Helm recounted. “Complicated chord structures? No problem. Garth would figure them out_ and we found ourselves able to play anything.”   From 1961-63_ the small-town Canadian kids and the Arkansas-born Helm played all over southern Ontario with Hawkins. Hudson brought along his Leslie speaker cabinet and a tricked-out Lowrey organ with wah-wah pedals.   After leaving Hawkins in early 1964_ the quintet_ now called Levon and the Hawks (and briefly the Canadian Squires)_ toured on their own across North America. Once_ they all got busted for possession of marijuana_ but only Danko was charged_ receiving a year on probation.   Hudson_ Robertson and Helm backed singer John Hammond on a 1965 album_ and in September of that year_ the Hawks auditioned for Dylan at Friar’s Tavern on Yonge Street in Toronto. They were with him when he shook up the folk world by switching to electric guitar on tours in 1965 and ’66.   During one stop at Toronto’s Massey Hall_ Dylan faced derision from folk music lovers in the audience_ and one local reviewer criticized Dylan for playing with a “third-rate Yonge Street band.”   “Only Garth seemed to understand why this was happening and chalked it up as a sign of the times_” Robertson wrote in his memoir as the rest of the band took the criticism personally.   “It was a job. Play a stadium_ play a theater_” Hudson told Maclean’s magazine in a 2002 profile. “My job was to provide arrangements with pads underneath_ pads and fills behind good poets. Same poems every night.”   In 1967_ the Hawks accompanied Dylan to his pink ranch house in Woodstock as he recuperated from a motorcycle accident. In the fall and winter of that year_ they collaborated on the bootleg recordings that would be known as The Basement Tapes.   “The typewriter would be there and Bob would tap on it for a while and then someone would go downstairs to check the equipment and then finally everyone would go down the pink stairs” to record more Dylan demos_ Hudson recalled in a 2014 documentary in which he returned to the “Big Pink” house and toured the cellar.   In 1968_ the five musicians became simply known as The Band and released Music From Big Pink_ which Rolling Stone in 2003 listed as No. 34 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.   During the next eight years_ they would record and release eight albums and hit songs including “The Weight_” “Up on Cripple Creek” and “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.”   The Band called it an era with a legendary final concert on Thanksgiving 1976 as captured in Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz (1978)_ but Hudson launched a solo career and reunited with Helm and Danko for a new album_ Jericho_ ultimately released in 1993_ followed by two more LPs.   He also contributed music to Scorsese’s The Raging Bull (1980) and to Philip Kaufman’s The Right Stuff (1983) and composed a 1980 score for a Los Angeles exhibit by sculptor Tony Duquette called Our Lady Queen of the Angels that became an album.   The Band was inducted into the Canadian Hall of Fame in 1989_ and in 1994_ with Hudson’s trademark bushy beard nearly all gray_ entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The humble organist used his address to name just about every musician he ever played with or was influenced by_ including the Gipsy Kings_ Leonard Cohen_ Van Morrison_ Muddy Waters_ Marianne Faithfull_ Roger Waters_ Jennifer Warnes_ Cyndi Lauper and Clifford Scott.

282152624,WASHINGTON (OSV News) — Among the first acts of his second term_ President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders including on immigration_ birthright citizenship and climate. Some Catholic organizations expressed concern about the scope of his orders and their potential impact on migrants.   In an event at Capital One Arena_ Trump signed a slew of executive orders in front of a crowd of his supporters. According to announcements from one of his aides_ Trump signed orders rescinding 78 of former President Joe Biden’s executive actions_ including one which created a task force to reunite families deliberately separated at the border. Another order suspended some U.S. refugee programs_ including one for Afghans cleared by the U.S. government to resettle in the U.S. due to threats by the Taliban after they aided the U.S.  Trump also signed an order withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate.  Once he reached the Oval Office_ Trump signed an executive order granting about 1_500 pardons for those charged in connection with the Jan. 6_ 2021_ riot at the U.S. Capitol — the day 2_000 supporters of then-President Donald Trump attempted to block Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory when he returned to the Oval Office later that evening. Trump indicated there might be additional commutations after “review.”   Trump also signed an executive order seeking to end the practice of birthright citizenship. The 14th Amendment states_ “All persons born or naturalized in the United States_ and subject to the jurisdiction thereof_ are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside_” but Trump told reporters in the Oval Office “we’re the only country in the world that does this.” The order will likely face legal challenges.   In his inaugural address just hours earlier_ Trump said he would sign a series of executive orders in the coming days_ including declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border_ shutting down “illegal entry_” and beginning “the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.” The White House said Trump would take “bold action to secure our border.”   While the specifics on how the White House may carry out a mass deportation program are not yet fully clear_ mass deportations more broadly run contrary to the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes” condemning “deportation” among other actions_ such as abortion_ that “poison human society” and give “supreme dishonor to the Creator_” a teaching St. John Paul II affirmed in two encyclicals on moral truth and life issues.  Executive orders are legally binding directives from the president and are published in the Federal Register. Conversely_ the term “executive actions” is broader and may include informal proposals for policy the president would like to see enacted. While it is typical for new presidents to issue some executive orders on their first day to signal certain priorities_ Trump signaled plans that were broader in scope. Some of his planned orders are expected to face legal challenges.  Chieko Noguchi_ executive director of public affairs for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops_ said in a statement the “conference will be carefully reviewing the executive orders that are expected to be signed today by President Trump.”   “The Catholic Church’s foundational teaching calls us to uphold the sacredness of human life and the God-given dignity of the human person. This means that the care for immigrants_ refugees_ and the poor is part of the same teaching of the Church that requires us to protect the most vulnerable among us_ especially unborn children_ the elderly and the infirm. The bishops’ conference will work with the Trump Administration as well as the U.S. Congress to advance the common good for all_ which will include instances of agreement_ as well as disagreement.”  Ronnate Asirwatham_ director of government relations for Network_ a Catholic social justice lobby_ said in a statement_ “In the coming days we will see an onslaught of Executive Orders_ proclamations_ and legislation that will attempt to criminalize our neighbors_ family members_ and friends_ we will not let our community be divided in this way.”   “From doctors to grocery store workers_ if our neighbors are ripped from our communities_ we will be grieving their loss_ absence_ gifts_ and contributions to our community and country_” Asirwatham said. “We refuse to stay silent as the state unnecessarily targets people_ all the while pursuing policies that benefit only the ultra-wealthy.”  Use of CBP One_ the mobile app run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to secure appointments needed to claim asylum and legally enter the United States_ was suspended as Trump’s term began.   Dylan Corbett_ executive director of the Hope Border Institute_ wrote in a post on X that while the app “wasn’t perfect_” it “contributed to a dramatic reduction in irregular border crossings and was the beginning of a safe_ orderly and rational way of managing migration at the border.”   “Demolishing it in a day will only make life more chaotic for Border Patrol and migrants_” he said.   The same evening_ the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to confirm Sen. Marco Rubio_ R-Fla._ as secretary of state on Monday_ making him the first confirmed member of Trump’s Cabinet in his second administration.  All 99 senators voted in favor of Rubio — including Rubio himself. The one vacancy in the Senate was due to Vice President JD Vance resigning from his Ohio seat earlier in January to take on his new role. Rubio subsequently resigned from the upper chamber as a result of his confirmation.   Kate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington. Follow her on X @kgscanlon.
282163834,The 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868_ after the close of the Civil War. The 13th Amendment had abolished slavery in 1865_ while the 14th settled the question of the citizenship of freed_ American-born former slaves.  Previous Supreme Court decisions_ like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857_ had decided that African Americans could never be US citizens. The 14th Amendment overrode that.  In 1898_ the US Supreme Court affirmed that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of Wong Kim Ark v United States.   Wong was a 24-year-old child of Chinese immigrants who was born in the US_ but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US_ his parents’ immigration status did not affect the application of the 14th Amendment.  “Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one’s parents_ all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered_” writes Erika Lee_ director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. “The court has not re-examined this issue since then.”

282514640,Four days ago_ the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban. Even before that decision was issued_ President Biden announced that he would not enforce the policy for the final 36 hours of his presidency. (In hindsight_ he may have been too busy signing pardons.) Yet_ for a short while_ TikTok went dark. And then TikTok turned on again_ in anticipation of Trump's inauguration. On his first day in office_ Trump signed an executive order concerning TikTok.  The order echoes President-Elect Trump's amicus brief. Trump asserts that the law impinges on his authority over national security:  I have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States_ the conduct of foreign policy_ and other vital executive functions. To fulfill those responsibilities_ I intend to consult with my advisors_ including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok_ and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans. My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date.  Like in the brief_ Trump refers to the timing of the statute as "unfortunate." This timing was no accident. Congress intended this decision to fall to President Biden.  The unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act — one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States — interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act's prohibitions before they take effect.  And Trump repeats his refrain that he can make a deal.  This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.  Trump directs his administration to take no action against anyone for seventy-five days.  Accordingly_ I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.  Trump doesn't quite say that the statute is unconstitutional. There is no basis_ then for an Article II override. Rather_ this seems to be purely an act of prosecutorial discretion. But it is more than that. Trump promises that no future penalties will be imposed on companies that work with TikTok.  Sec. 2. Action. (a) I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order_ to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok. During this period_ the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act_ including for distributing_ maintaining_ or updating (or enabling the distribution_ maintenance_ or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. In light of this direction_ even after the expiration of the above-specified period_ the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order_ including the period of time from January 19_ 2025_ to the signing of this order.  In theory at least_ the next administration could choose to bring an action within the statute of limitations. But that is unlikely. What makes this more unlikely is that the Attorney General must issue a non-enforcement letter:  (b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a). (c) I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period_ as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order.  I am fairly certain that these sorts of letters can be relied upon in the event of any future enforcement action. Alan Rozhenstein flags Zach Price's article about reliance on non-enforcement. Alan makes some fair points_ but as a matter of realpolitik_ I doubt there will ever be a prosecution. And that is enough for the lawyers at Oracle and Akami.  Apart from the estoppel argument_ I see here a fairly clear violation of the Take Care Clause. This is not simply an exercise in discretion. The President is authorizing the violation of a statute that was just upheld by the Supreme Court. And this order_ like others_ issues direct orders to the Attorney General about how to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Trump is making clear that he sees the Attorney General as his subordinate. I am inclined to agree with this view of Article II_ but it represents a departure from how past presidents have interacted with their Attorney Generals.  Finally_ the Attorney General can take steps to block enforcement of the ban by private parties or states.  (d) Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General_ attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive. The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive's exclusive authority to enforce the Act.  I'm a bit confused_ as I don't see any private causes of action under the statute.  As a coda to signing the order_ President Trump announced one possible deal:  The order_ one of Mr. Trump's first acts after taking office_ instructs the attorney general not to take any action to enforce the law so that his administration has "an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward." The order is retroactive to Sunday. As he signed the order_ Mr. Trump told reporters that "the U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok" if a deal for the app is reached_ without going into detail. He said he thought TikTok could be worth a trillion dollars. The order could immediately face legal challenges_ including over whether a president has the power to halt enforcement of a federal law. Companies subject to the law_ which forbids providing services to Chinese-owned TikTok_ may determine that the order does not provide a shield from legal liability.  Trump said: "If I do the deal for the United States_ I think we should get half."  After Trump filed his brief_ I wrote:  After nearly a decade_ I think people still do not understand Trump. He doesn't play like everyone else does_ and that is what infuriates people. When he says something that people deem outlandish_ it is merely an opening bid_ not the final offer. I think he views this case like he views just about everything else--as a deal to be made.  All his proceeding are going to plan.
282514638,President Donald Trump_ fulfilling a promise made at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in May_ pardoned Ross Ulbricht today. Ulbricht had been serving a life sentence for his role in founding and operating the dark web marketplace Silk Road.  As Trump put it in a Truth Social post: "in honor of [his mother Lyn Ulbricht]_ and the Libertarian Movement_ which supported me so strongly_ it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son_ Ross." He said "the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me."  As I reported on his sentencing in May 2015 (he has been in prison since his October 2013 arrest):  Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison with no parole…by Judge Katherine Forrest in U.S. District Court for the southern district of New York. Ulbricht was convicted back in February on seven charges_ all related to the operation of the darkwebsite called Silk Road_ which used Tor-enabled anonymity and the cryptocurrency bitcoin to allow people to buy and sell often illegal items in safety and security_ with the site providing an escrow service between buyer and seller to ensure both were satisfied. Ulbricht was a clever entrepreneur_ enthralled by libertarian ideas derived from the likes of Murray Rothbard and Samuel Konkin about the richness and justice of truly free markets not hobbled by government threats. The charges were: "narcotics trafficking; distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet; narcotics trafficking conspiracy; continuing criminal enterprise; conspiracy to aid and abet computer hacking; conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identity documents; and money laundering conspiracy." None of the charges were related to either personally selling an illegal substance to anyone—Ulbricht merely ran a website that facilitated it—and none were related to causing direct harm to anyone's life or property. Given the amazing water-muddying the prosecution achieved by talking about_ but never trying Ulbricht for or proving in court beyond a reasonable doubt_ allegedly planned_ but never executed_ murders for hire_ one wonders whether the judge allowed any thoughts of those rumors_ even subconsciously_ to shape her sentencing decision.  Silk Road's innovative mail order using bitcoin_ combined with user reviews of sellers_ imposed some real market discipline on dealers_ kept buyers from the occasional dangers of physically obtaining drugs_ and allowed people not violating others' lives and property to buy and sell drugs with less (but not zero) legal risk.  Because of all that_ and the site's role in publicizing and popularizing the use of bitcoin as currency_ Ulbricht was considered a martyr of sorts to many in the libertarian and bitcoin communities.  Trump's promise_ out of character for a man who otherwise advocates the death penalty for drug dealing_ was widely seen as an attempt to appeal to those parts of the larger anti-establishment coalition he put together on his way to his return to the White House.  Ulbricht has expressed regret and his intention to be a law-abiding citizen_ and there is certainly little reason to think he'd ever represent any danger to others on release. Reason's Nick Gillespie and Jacob Sullum have_ in the past week_ provided detailed discussions about why letting Ulbricht out after serving 11 years is proper and just.  As I wrote upon his sentencing_ Ulbricht need not "worry about redemption per se. Ulbricht and Silk Road….sent out a more powerful message than the one the government wanted Judge [Katherine] Forrest to send: that ingenuity and technology and effort can create wonderfully helpful realms of freedom in markets and behavior."  The Libertarian Party Connection  Despite facing criticism for her support of Trump—and for the L.P.'s falling fortunes in membership_ money_ and candidates—Angela McArdle_ chair of the Libertarian National Committee_ argued for Libertarian support for Trump in large part based on his promise of Ulbricht's release_ or at least because he was the type of major party candidate who would release him. While she has at different times intimated that her cooperation with Trump induced him to make the promise_ and also that_ as she told Tom Woods on his podcast in June 2024_ Trump in fact already signed a pardon for Ulbricht in 2020 but was somehow foiled by underlings_ the pardon does indicate that Trump considers a libertarian constituency one he is behooved to do favors for_ which is an encouraging sign that he can feel pressured to sometimes do the right thing in libertarian terms.  While many doubted Trump would come through_ Ulbricht himself seemed confident it would happen_ as he expressed in a November post-election X post. McArdle also insisted in a November interview with Reason's Robby Soave on The Hill's Rising program that she'd arranged meetings between Trump's people and Ulbricht's family about the matter. McArdle repeated her confidence that Trump would make good on his vow last week.  One just favor for libertarians does not a libertarian administration make_ especially not one so dedicated to hobbling free trade_ punishing the press_ rounding up peaceful immigrants_ and pursuing autarkist nationalist industrial policy. But Trump's coming through on this promise makes a huge difference for one man who did not deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison_ and deserves justified applause.

282816930,The Jets are bringing back one of their own.  The team hired Aaron Glenn to be their 19th head coach on Tuesday. Glenn_ who was the team’s first-round draft choice in 1994 and played eight seasons for the Jets_ spent the past four years as the Lions defensive coordinator.  The Jets zeroed in on Glenn during an extensive search for a head coaching candidate that saw them interview 16 different people. Glenn_ 52_ emerged as the favorite to get the job after Mike Vrabel decided to take the Patriots job.  Glenn interviewed for a second time with the Jets on Tuesday in Florham Park. He interviewed virtually with the team on Jan. 9.  Lance Newmark_ who knows Glenn from three years together in Detroit_ interviewed for the general manager job for a second time on Tuesday.  Newmark spent 26 seasons in Detroit before going to the Commanders last year where he was the assistant general manager under Adam Peters.  Newmark had a virtual interview with the Jets on Jan. 11_ two days after Glenn interviewed for the job. That could be a sign that he was recommended by Glenn. It would make sense for the Jets to try to pair two men who have a previous working relationship in the jobs.  Glenn’s defenses in Detroit ranked 29th_ 32nd_ 19th and 20th in yards allowed per game and 31st_ 28th_ 23rd and 7th in points allowed. The Lions went 15-2 this season and were the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs despite losing a number of defensive players to injury. The Lions were upset by the Commanders 45-31 on Saturday.  The Jets are not hiring Glenn just for his defensive acumen_ though. Glenn is known as a tough coach who is popular with players but also is not shy when holding them accountable. The Jets entered this coaching search prioritizing leadership over everything else.  The biggest question about Glenn now will be who he hires as his offensive coordinator. Glenn said last week that he does not view himself as just a defensive coach.  “Here’s the one thing that I will say about myself_ I’m a coach_ I just happen to be on defense_” Glenn said. “I understand the offense just as well as a number of people_ so if you want to hire me_ you’re going to hire a coach_ you’re not going to hire a defensive coach. I’m going to talk to the offense just as much as I’m going to talk to the defense.”  The Lions’ surprising loss to Washington accelerated the hiring process. If the Lions had won_ the Jets would have been unable to interview Glenn in person until next week.  Glenn was scheduled to interview a second time with the Saints on Wednesday but the Jets made sure that did not happen. Glenn also interviewed with the Jaguars_ Raiders and Bears during this hiring cycle.  Glenn began his post-playing career as a scout with the Jets in 2012-13. He then worked as a coach for the Browns and Saints before taking the Lions job under head coach Dan Campbell in 2021.  The Jets are coming off a disappointing 5-12 season that began with high expectations. Jets owner Woody Johnson fired coach Robert Saleh after a 2-3 start but the move did not change the direction of the team. He fired GM Joe Douglas six weeks later.  Glenn and the new GM will have to decide whether to bring back quarterback Aaron Rodgers_ who remains under contract but did not produce the results people expected last season.  There is also a question about whether to bring back wide receiver Davante Adams_ who was acquired by trade in the middle of the season.  The answers to those questions will get cleared up in the coming weeks. For now_ the Jets have found their new leader and it is a familiar face.

282511436,A German man on a legal visa is accused of killing a United States Border Agent during a traffic stop in Vermont near the Northern border_ according to Fox News Digital.  According to FBI Albany_ the deceased suspect is confirmed to be a German national with a valid visa in the U.S.  The incident took place on Monday_ Jan. 20_ when 44-year-old U.S. Border Patrol Agent David “Chris” Maland was shot during a traffic stop on Interstate 91 between Newport and Orleans_ Vermont.  In a statement_ FBI Albany said that Maland was a U.S. Air Force veteran_ saying: “We are heartbroken for our partners and share in their grief as they mourn the loss of their colleague.”  “FBI Albany has numerous resources in the area_ to include our Evidence Response Team (ERT)_ Victim Services_ Digital Forensics_ and dozens of Special Agents_” they said.  On Monday night_ authorities were seen using a robotic device to inspect a backpack near what appeared to be a body on the ground at the scene.  The Border Patrol Union shared its condolences_ saying on X_ “Our hearts and prayers go out to the family_ friends_ and coworkers of our fallen brother in green in Vermont.”   Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)_ Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.)_ and Rep. Becca Balint (Vt.-AL) shared their condolences with the family.  “Border Patrol agents do important work protecting our borders. They deserve our full support in terms of staffing_ pay and working conditions_” the elected officials shared in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to working with the agency to make sure that they have all the resources they need to do the enormously important work that is their responsibility. Together_ we must do everything possible to prevent future tragedies like what happened today.”  The shooting came just hours after President Donald Trump was inaugurated to a second term. He campaigned heavily on securing the border and defending law enforcement.
282721010,By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and ERIC TUCKER_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is directing its federal prosecutors to investigate any state or local officials who stand in the way of beefed-up enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration_ according to a memo to the entire workforce obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday.  Written by Emil Bove_ the acting deputy attorney general_ the memo also says the department will return to the principle of charging defendants with the most serious crime it can prove_ a staple position of Republican-led departments meant to remove a prosecutor’s discretion to charge a lower-level offense.  Much of the memo is centered on immigration enforcement. Bove wrote that prosecutors shall “take all steps necessary to protect the public and secure the American border by removing illegal aliens from the country and prosecuting illegal aliens for crimes” committed in U.S. jurisdiction.  The memo also suggests state and local officials who stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement could themselves come under scrutiny. It directs prosecutors to investigate any episodes in which state and local officials obstruct or impede federal functions.  “Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting_ obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests_” the memo says. “The U.S. Attorney’s Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution.”  The three-page memo signals an immediate and sharp turnabout in priorities from President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration_ with prosecutors told in no uncertain terms that they will be on the front lines of an administration-wide effort to crack down on illegal immigration and border crime and that they are expected to carry out the policy vision of President Donald Trump’s Republican White House when it comes to violent crimes_ the threat of transnational gangs and drug trafficking.  “Indeed_ it is the responsibility of the Justice Department to defend the Constitution_ and accordingly_ to lawfully execute the policies that the American people elected President Trump to implement_” Bove wrote in the memo obtained by the AP.  “The Justice Department’s responsibility_ proudly shouldered by each of its employees_ includes aggressive enforcement of laws enacted by Congress_ as well as vigorous defense of the President’s actions on behalf of the United States against legal challenges_” Bove added. “The Department’s personnel must come together in the offices that taxpayers have funded to do this important work.”

People who feel seen and heard have reduced feelings of isolation and increased resilience_ which lends the confidence to step forward with purpose and clarity.   CANCER (June 22-July 22). While others brag and call attention to themselves_ you will stay quiet and let your work speak for itself. Not everyone understands your work_ which is good. It tells you where to focus the best of your energy_ which is to say on the ones who do.  LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). What do knowledge_ topical medicine and skincare products have in common? All must be absorbed to work for you. If there’s a protective layer or anything causing resistance_ it needs to be removed before anything else will soak in.  VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). The golden rule of “do unto others” is delightful only if they want the same things you want. If that is not the case_ no gold comes of the rule. Those who listen to and supply what the others want will be rewarded.   LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). You’re building something extraordinary -- not just with your projects but in the way you’re crafting a life that feels right and warm. Trust that even in the less ideal moments_ you’re still moving toward your best self. Your strength outweighs your doubts.   SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Let love grow by letting love go. You’ve demonstrated your intent. You’ve listened and learned. You’ve done enough to get to know and be known by the other person. Now step back and trust the hand of fate.  SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You’ll leverage a special friendship to tick off an item on your wish list. Getting what you want will have a ripple effect_ and others will get what they want_ too. Your presence just might start a scene.   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). What’s chased will run. This is why you don’t chase and instead focus on building attraction. It has you ignoring what you’re bad at and maximizing your gifts. With a focus on strengths_ weaknesses become a moot point.   TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 22). Self-awareness and accountability will ring through your triumphs and shape your personal_ professional and financial gains. Even so_ what you’re conscious of is only a small portion of the story. Unconscious desire manifests into magic. More highlights: a mind-blowing coincidence_ adoration from afar_ and critical acclaim for the tremendous beauty you create. Gemini and Scorpio adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 3_ 22_ 1_ 5 and 15.  CELEBRITY PROFILES: Ten-year-old Guy Fieri opened a pretzel cart and never looked back.

282973116,LONDON (AP) — A violence-obsessed teenager is facing decades in prison when he is sentenced for stabbing three young girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed summer dance class.  Axel Rudakubana_ 18_ faces a sentencing hearing Thursday at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England over the July 29 attack_ which devastated the seaside town of Southport_ shocked the country and set off both street violence and soul-searching.  The crime triggered anti-immigrant rioting and has led the government to reconsider its definition of terrorism_ its approach to online radicalization and the way information about criminal suspects is made public.  Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder_ 10 of attempted murder for those he injured_ and additional charges of possessing a knife_ the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on all charges on Monday – sparing victims’ families a lengthy trial_ but also potentially robbing them of answers.  Prosecutors plan to set out their case against Rudakubana in detail during Thursday’s hearing_ with relatives of the victims watching in court.  The attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when two dozen little girls were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana_ armed with a knife_ intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher.  He killed Alice Da Silva Aguiar_ 9_ Elsie Dot Stancombe_ 7_ and Bebe King_ 6. Eight other girls_ ranging in age from 7 to 13_ were wounded_ along with instructor Leanne Lucas and John Hayes_ who worked in a business next door and intervened.  The killings in the northwest England town triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K. Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack_ and alleged that police and the government were withholding information.  Rudakubana was born in Cardiff_ Wales to Christian parents from Rwanda_ and investigators have not been able to pin down his motivation.  In the years before the attack he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told lawmakers on Tuesday that Rudakubana “was convicted of a violent assault against another child at school” and had multiple contacts with children’s social care_ mental health services and police_ who were called to his home over his behavior five times between 2019 and 2022. He was referred three times to the government’s anti-extremism program_ Prevent_ when he was 13 and 14.  All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed.  The government has declared the case a wake-up call. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it must lead to “fundamental change” in the way the state protects its citizens_ announcing a public inquiry into the failures that allowed Rudakubana to carry out his rampage with a knife he had ordered from Amazon.  He said laws might need updating to combat a “new threat” from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism_ “acts of extreme violence carried out by loners_ misfits_ young men in their bedrooms.”  The Crown Prosecution Service has defended the decision not to disclose details before Rudakubana went to court_ saying “releasing that information earlier would have put the trial at risk.” U.K. contempt of court laws limit what can be reported before trial_ in the interests of preventing jury bias.

Windows Central reports the mysterious unannounced game is "a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history_" which certainly sounds intriguing.

Xbox spent most of 2024 adjusting its strategy around releasing games_ delaying some titles to this year_ and bringing some formerly exclusive games to the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. The company seems like it's favoring timed exclusives over hoarding everything for Xbox and PC_ so the job of this Developer Direct is a little bit different this time. Besides letting developers sell their games_ the real test of the show is if it can get you excited about games that are coming to Xbox first_ rather than only coming to Xbox at all.  You can watch the Xbox Developer Direct showcase on YouTube_ Twitch_ or right here in the embed above when it starts at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.

283593066,Marilyn Manson will not be criminally charged for domestic violence and sexual assault following a four-year investigation_ the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office announced in a press release Friday.  LA District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman said “experienced prosecutors from the Sex Crimes Division of the District Attorney’s Office_ along with detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department” came to the decision following a “comprehensive” probe into the shock rocker.  “We have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations_ and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt_” he added.   Hochman then went on to praise the women who had come forward for their “courage and resilience.”  “While we are unable to bring charges in this matter_ we recognize that the strong advocacy of the women involved has helped bring greater awareness to the challenges faced by survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault_” he said.   “Due to their efforts_ victims of domestic violence have a greater voice in our criminal justice system and prosecutorial offices around the country have improved tools to hold domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions.”  Hochman concluded that his office remains “committed” to “seeking justice for survivors.”  Page Six has reached out to reps for Manson on the decision but did not immediately hear back.  The “Beautiful People” singer has also not commented on the matter on social media yet. However_ he took to his Instagram Stories on Friday to promote his upcoming North American tour dates.  In February 2021_ Manson’s ex Evan Rachel Wood accused him of grooming her when she was just a teenager and abusing her throughout their relationship.   “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission_” she wrote via Instagram at the time.  “I am done living in fear of retaliation_ slander_ or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him_ before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.”  Her remarks prompted others to come forward_ including model Sarah McNeilly who alleged Manson locked her in rooms when she was “bad” and forced her to listen to him entertaining other women — leaving her “emotionally abused_ terrorized and scarred.”   “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco also alleged the “Tainted Love” singer had abused her_ which the rocker’s lawyers previously said were claims that were “provably false.”  However_ TMZ learned at the time that both the FBI and local law enforcement in Los Angeles were looking to meet with Manson’s accusers as an initial examination into whether a crime had been committed which warranted further investigation.  In November 2021_ police conducted a search at the “Sweet Dream” rocker’s home as part of their ongoing probe into the sexual assault claims.  Manson_ whose real name is Brian Warner_ has maintained his innocence and even sued Wood_ 37_ for defamation — but dropped that lawsuit this past November.  This is not the first time the goth rocker has been able to escape charges from the LA DA.   According to Variety_ the office said in 2018 that the charges leveled against Manson seven years prior in 2011 had been dismissed due to an expiration on the statute of limitations on two charges and an absence of corroboration for a sexual assault claim.
283376044,Martin Luther King Jr’s family offered their response to President Donald Trump’s decision to release the secret FBI files on the civil rights icon’s assassination nearly 60 years ago — a “deeply personal family loss” that they are still feeling today.  On Thursday Trump signed an executive order to release the files connected to the deaths of King_ former President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy.  “For us_ the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release_” the family said.   Trump said “everything will be revealed” while signing the executive order in the Oval Office.  The order called the release of the files “long overdue” and requires the Department of Justice and Office of the Director of National Intelligence to rapidly prepare for the release.  King was shot and killed by James Earl Ray on the evening of April 4_ 1968_ as he stood on a second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis_ Tenn.  King’s family has continued to work towards a comprehensive investigation into the assassination_ emphasizing the importance of uncovering the truth while also focusing on preserving the icon’s legacy_ Fox Atlanta reported.   The fatal shooting came after the FBI worked to undermine the minister’s anti-racial discrimination advocacy.  An anonymous letter from the agency to King was believed to be an attempt to get the civil rights leader to commit suicide.  An analysis from the FBI 23 days before the assassination claimed King’s inner circle had an inordinate number of Communists.  The analysis noted that two of King’s former aides were Communist Party members_ while eight others had communist affiliations.   The document claimed the party had attempted to form a black labor coalition to spread its goals across the US_ arguing King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference were “made to order” for the communist mission.  A black minister had attended a minister training workshop hosted by King in February 1968 and “expressed his disgust with the behind-the-scene [sic] drinking_ fornication and homosexuality that went on at the conference_” the analysis stated.   “Throughout the ensuing years and until this date_” the FBI analysis said_ “King has continued to carry on his sexual aberrations secretly while holding himself out to public view as a moral leader of religious conviction.”  King was arrested several times throughout his career_ with former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover considering him a radical.  President Kennedy’s grandson reacted to the news of the executive order_ claiming Trump was doing it for political reasons   “Declassification is using JFK as a political prop_ when he’s not here to punch back_” Jack Schlossberg said. “There’s nothing heroic about it.”

The lawsuit including Montag and other Pacific Palisades residents was filed Tuesday. (Photo by ... [+] Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP_ File) 2019 Invision  The lawsuit blamed the city and the utility’s management of its water supply and emergency response infrastructure for causing damage to properties of Montag_ Pratt and 20 other “owners_ tenants and individuals” impacted by the Palisades Fire_ according to the Times.  The suit specifically alleges inverse condemnation_ a concept used by property owners who claim a government entity has taken an action resulting in damage to the property—the concept also seeks just compensation.  Lawyers for Montag and other claimants pointed out the Santa Ynez Reservoir_ a reservoir near the Palisades that was offline and empty for repairs while the Palisades Fire ignited and spread.  The complaint scrutinized the local water supply system further_ according to the Times_ claiming LADWP made ​​“the conscious decision to operate the water supply system with the reservoir drained and unusable as a ‘cost-saving’ measure.”  Montag and Pratt announced on Jan. 8 the Palisades Fire destroyed their home_ which was valued around $3.8 million as of this month.  The LAWDP did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.

The Times noted experts have said the municipal water systems in place in the Palisades were not equipped for the strength of the Palisades Fire_ which was made significantly worse by extremely strong winds that stopped first responders from safely operating water-dumping helicopters and planes in the early stages of the fire.  Crucial Quote  “On information and belief_ the Palisades Fire was an inescapable and unavoidable consequence of the water supply system servicing areas in and around Pacific Palisades as it was planned and constructed_” the lawsuit reportedly said. “The system necessarily failed_ and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this Complaint.”  What Other Celebrities Lost Their Homes In The Palisades Fire?  Actors such as Miles Teller_ John C. Reilly and Mel GIbson lost their homes in the blaze_ while other public figures like comedian Pete Lee_ "Shark Tank" investor Barbara Corcoran and Paris Hilton also had their homes destroyed.

Unfortunately_ CRIME was not the answer (is it ever?) but with only one word remaining_ I finally snagged CREPE for the win.

283292564,WASHINGTON (OSV News) — President Donald Trump on Jan. 23 signed an executive order directing the declassification of files on the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy_ the nation’s first Catholic president_ his brother Sen. Robert Kennedy_ and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr._ the famed Civil Rights era leader.  Rev. King led the nation’s fight for civil rights before he was gunned down in Memphis_ Tennessee_ April 4_ 1968. Upon King’s death_ RFK gave an impassioned speech in Indianapolis for racial unity following Rev. King’s non-violent witness_ which is widely regarded as having calmed tensions in the city. But within two months_ RFK himself was struck down.  Each of those three killings took place within a span of five years during the 1960s. They were each carried out by lone gunmen according to public record. But the remainder of still-classified documents in the decades-old cases have been the subject of conspiracy theories and public interest.  “More than 50 years after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy_ Senator Robert F. Kennedy_ and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King_ Jr._ the Federal Government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events_” Trump’s executive order states. “Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay.”  Congress mandated in 1992 that all JFK assassination documents were to be released within 25 years; but multiple presidents_ including Trump_ authorized delays.  Trump previously pledged to declassify the documents in his first term_ but did not follow through at that time amid intelligence community concern.  “That’s a big one_” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed the executive order. “Lot of people are waiting for this for a long_ long time_ for years_ for decades_ and everything will be revealed.”  Trump then directed an aide to give the pen he used to do so to Robert F. Kennedy Jr._ nephew to the late president and RFK’s son. The late senator served as JFK’s attorney general_ and was mounting his own bid for the presidency when he was killed by Sirhan Sirhan in June 1968.  RFK Jr. is Trump’s pick for secretary of Health and Human Services. He faces a contentious confirmation battle in the Senate in part due to his controversial views on vaccines and has long sought the release of the documents related to the assassinations of his father and his uncle.  Robert Schmuhl_ professor emeritus of American studies at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana_ who critically observes the modern American presidency_ told OSV News_ “assassinations always breed conspiracy theories and unanswered questions.”  “If declassifying and releasing additional documents bring an end to unfounded speculation_ the actions are in the public interest_” he said.  JFK faced anti-Catholic prejudice while campaigning to become the first Catholic to hold the nation’s highest office. His presidential library noted Gov. Al Smith of New York_ a Catholic Democrat like JFK_ failed in his 1928 election bid as he was “dogged by claims that he would build a tunnel connecting the White House and the Vatican.” JFK used his rhetorical gifts to tackle the issue head-on_ persuading Protestant Americans that they had nothing to fear from a Catholic serving as president of the United States.  In a shock to the nation_ JFK was assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22_ 1963_ while preparing to run for a second term. Police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald in connection with the killing. Oswald was himself shot to death two days later while being transferred in police custody.  “How John Kennedy died has often overshadowed what he did and meant_” Schmuhl said. “America and the world deserve to learn as much as possible about the verifiable details of what happened. Secrecy serves no purpose in this regard.”  Kate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington. Follow her on X @kgscanlon.
283345920,Ten-time champion Novak Djokovic has sensationally withdrawn from the Australian Open after losing a marathon first set of his semi-final against second seed Alexander Zverev.  Djokovic walked immediately to the chair umpire to say he could not go on after dropping the set in a tiebreaker after one hour and 21 minutes on Jan. 24  The former world No.1 again had his left thigh heavily strapped after hurting himself in his quarter-final win over Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday night.  Djokovic said then he would likely have to skip routine practice before playing Zverev_ but declined to reveal the exact details of his injury.  The 37-year-old did_ however_ say it was similar to the hamstring injury he nursed while winning his 10th Open title two years ago.  Zverev’s victory_ which came when Djokovic quit after losing the tiebreaker 7-5_ propelled the 27-year-old German into his maiden Australian Open final_ and the third grand slam title match of his career.  The world No.2 lost the 2020 US Open final to Dominic Thiem as well as last year’s French Open decider to Alcaraz.  Djokovic had been bidding to win an unprecedented 25th grand slam singles crown at Melbourne Park_ having been level with Margaret Court on 24 since the 2023 US Open.  Zverev will play the winner of Friday night’s second semi-final between Italy’s top-ranked titleholder Jannik Sinner and American world No.20 Ben Shelton.  The German offered his sympathy to Djokovic and urged the Rod Laver Arena crowd to show respect towards the living legend.  “I know that everybody paid for tickets and everybody wants to see hopefully a great five-set match and everything but you’ve got to understand_” Zverev said.  “Novak Djokovic is somebody who has given this sport for the past 20 years absolute everything of his life.  “He has won this tournament with an abdominal tear. He has won this tournament with a hamstring tear. If he cannot continue a tennis match_ it really means he cannot continue a tennis match.  “So_ please be respectful and really_ really show some love for Novak as well.”  Djokovic said he may have played on had he won the first set_ but conceded he could not have carried on for four or five hours.  “I actually thought it was quite a high-level first set_” Zverev said.  “But_ I mean like_ of course_ there are some difficulties and the longer you continue playing then maybe the worse it gets.  “In the tiebreak_ maybe he was not moving as well as in the entire first set but I thought we had extremely long rallies_ extremely difficult_ physical also rallies.  “In the tiebreak_ I did see him struggle maybe a bit more.”
283439984,The defendants in that case were charged with two federal offenses: conspiring against civil rights and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act_ for the parts they played in blocking the entrance to that clinic. That law makes it a crime to threaten_ obstruct or injure a person seeking access to a reproductive health clinic or to damage clinic property.  One of the anti-abortion activists_ Lauren Handy_ was sentenced to nearly five years in prison last year for her role in leading the blockade. Her case drew widespread attention when the police said that they had found five fetuses in her home shortly after she was charged in the case. Other defendants received sentences of less than three years in prison. One defendant_ Jay Smith_ 34_ of Freeport_ New York_ pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison.
283675534,Pete Hegseth_ a former Fox News host_ has been confirmed as the next United States secretary of defense_ receiving the keys to the nation's largest federal agency.   After a tense Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 14_ a number of Republicans who previously expressed doubts about Hegseth's nomination declared that they would fall in line behind President Donald Trump's preferred candidate.   The Senate Armed Services Committee_ which helped vet Hegseth_ recommended on Jan. 20 that he be confirmed by the full Senate_ and on Friday_ Jan. 24_ the Senate heeded the committee's advice by voting 51-50 to approve his nomination.   Vice President J.D. Vance needed to place a tie-breaking vote after Republican Senators Mitch McConnell_ Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination.   Hegseth was considered one of Trump's riskiest nominations_ making his confirmation a major feat for the administration. Three other controversial nominees will be put to the test next: Robert F. Kennedy Jr._ nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services; Tulsi Gabbard_ nominated for director of national intelligence; and Kash Patel_ nominated for FBI director.   Prior to Hegseth's confirmation vote_ Murkowski and Collins revealed that they would oppose his nomination to oversee the Pentagon and all U.S. Armed Forces_ each writing lengthy statements that explained their similar_ myriad reasons for voting against him — including mentions of his many controversies_ thin résumé_ and previous comments he's made about how women do not belong in combat roles.   "He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views_" Collins wrote on X. "I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed."   From Murkowski's X statement: "Above all_ I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense_ and must be prioritized without compromise. The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers_ and Mr. Hegseth’s nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook."   Hegseth's nomination on Nov. 13_ 2024_ was quickly tainted by a resurfaced sexual assault allegation from 2017.   According to a police report_ his accuser alleged that the former Fox News host had sexually assaulted her at the 2017 California Federation of Republican Women biennial conference — where Hegseth was the keynote speaker and the woman was an organizer.   Hegseth was never charged in connection to the incident. However_ he entered into a settlement agreement with the woman_ which included monetary compensation and a confidentiality clause_ per CNN.   On Jan. 23_ The Associated Press reported that the settlement payment amounted to $50_000.   When the police report resurfaced_ Hegseth's attorney_ Timothy Parlatore_ told CNN: “This police report confirms what I’ve said all along_ that the incident was fully investigated_ and police found the allegations to be false_ which is why no charges were filed."   Trump's transition team expressed similar sentiments one day later_ claiming police found the allegations to be false — though authorities only concluded that they did not have enough evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   During his Senate confirmation hearing_ Hegseth denied the allegations and said they were "anonymous_ false charges.”   The scandal involving Hegseth grew when The New York Times obtained a 2018 email from Penelope Hegseth_ the Fox News host's mother. In the correspondence_ she called him "despicable" and "an abuser of women_" though she told the outlet she rescinded her thoughts to her son one day later.   The New Yorker then reported on Dec. 1 that Hegseth was allegedly ousted from previous nonprofit leadership positions due to mismanagement of funds_ repeated drunkenness and misconduct with women.   Hegseth downplayed the claims as part of a coordinated smear campaign during his confirmation hearing and vowed that he would not drink if he was confirmed.   Many Republicans withheld their support for Hegseth amid the controversies_ though Trump maintained outward confidence that his nominee still had a path to getting confirmed.   On Jan. 21_ before the Senate took Hegseth's confirmation to a vote_ his former sister-in-law came forward with new allegations against him_ claiming in an affidavit submitted to the Senate that his second wife_ Samantha_ feared for her safety and made escape plans_ allegedly going so far as to develop a code word that she could use to get help.   Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed_ the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee_ told NBC News in a statement_ “As I have said for months_ the reports of Mr. Hegseth’s history of alleged sexual assault_ alcohol abuse_ and public misconduct necessitate an exhaustive background investigation. I have been concerned that the background check process has been inadequate_ and this sworn affidavit confirms that fact."   Reed added that “the alleged pattern of abuse and misconduct by Mr. Hegseth is disturbing. This behavior would disqualify any service member from holding any leadership position in the military_ much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense.”   Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​_ from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.   In an email to NBC News_ Samantha asserted that there was no physical abuse in her marriage.   Hegseth's lawyer also responded to the latest allegations: "Sam has never alleged that there was any abuse_ she signed court documents acknowledging that there was no abuse and recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview."
283772082,TEL AVIV — Four Israeli female soldiers were released by Hamas in Gaza City on Saturday morning_ marking the start of a second week of a protracted ceasefire and hostage release deal that has halted 15 months of fighting and delivered Hamas a new platform to project optics of power.
283674718,The Dallas Cowboys are going with an in-house option for their next head coach. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer and the Cowboys have agreed to a deal to make him Dallas' next head coach_ the team announced on Friday. Schottenheimer_ 51_ has been on the Cowboys' coaching staff for the last three seasons_ serving as their offensive coordinator since 2023. However_ former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy handled the offensive playcalling duties over the last two years. Still_ Schottenheimer's promotion aligned with quarterback Dak Prescott's best season. The Cowboys quarterback finished second in MVP voting in 2023_ leading the league in passing touchdowns that year en route to the team's third straight 12-5 season. Now_ Schottenheimer will be tasked with helping Prescott return to that level along with improving the rest of the Cowboys' roster following a disappointing 7-10 season in 2024. Prescott_ who'll be 32 when the 2025 season begins_ missed the back half of 2024 after undergoing hamstring surgery_ which came following his early-season struggles. Prescott's injury_ along with a handful of others_ played a big part in why Dallas started the year 3-7_ essentially ending its playoff hopes before Thanksgiving. The Cowboys opted to keep McCarthy around through the end of the season_ but announced that they were unable to come to terms on a new deal on Jan. 13_ a day before his contract was set to expire. The Cowboys' decision to part with McCarthy made them the seventh team this offseason to have a head coach vacancy_ but it came over a week after the end of the regular season. As a result_ Dallas missed out on the opportunity to speak with a few of the top coaching candidates early on_ such as Mike Vrabel_ Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn. Dallas didn't conduct many interviews_ though_ in its search to replace McCarthy. Former Jets head coach Robert Saleh_ Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore (who previously played and coached for the Cowboys) and Seahawks assistant head coach Leslie Frazier were the only other three candidates to interview for the opening. There were also some rumors that Colorado coach and former Cowboys star Deion Sanders was a top candidate for the opening. Despite reports of mutual interest_ Sanders never officially interviewed for the job. Jones also informally spoke to former Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. Schottenheimer has never been a head coach before_ but he brings nearly three decades of experience as an offensive assistant coach to the table. He served as an offensive coordinator for a few other teams before joining the Cowboys in 2022_ working in that role for the Jets (2006-11)_ Rams (2012-14) and Seahawks (2018-20). Schottenheimer is also the son of decorated former NFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer. The elder Schottenheimer was a head coach for four teams_ recording the ninth-most wins (205) for a coach in NFL history. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

283726482,WASHINGTON – The Senate is heading towards a vote on confirming South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary_ placing her at the head of a sprawling agency that will be essential to both national security and President Donald Trump’s plans to squash illegal immigration.  Republicans were determined to barrel through on Noem’s confirmation_ threatening to keep the Senate working through the weekend to install Trump’s national security Cabinet officials. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth won confirmation Friday night_ and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were already in place.  Noem_ a Trump ally who is in her second term as South Dakota governor_ received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier this week. Republicans_ who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her_ have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement.  “Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities_” Senate Majority Leader John Thune_ a fellow South Dakota Republican_ said Friday. “And it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.”  Noem will oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection_ Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies_ the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation_ protecting dignitaries_ responding to natural disasters and more.  Trump is planning major changes to the way the department functions_ including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday.  During her confirmation hearing_ Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to.  Noem avoided saying that she would defy the president_ but told the homeland security panel_ “I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.”  Still_ Noem will be entering a job that was a pressure cooker under the first Trump administration. Six people cycled through the homeland security secretary position during his first four years in office.  Noem_ who held her state’s lone U.S. House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019_ has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point_ she was even under consideration to be his running mate.  Her political stock took a momentary dip_ however_ when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog_ as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Now she will be tasked with delivering on Trump’s favorite issue_ border security. The president’s goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could also still put Noem_ with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm_ in a difficult position. In her home state of South Dakota_ many migrants_ some in the country without permanent legal status_ power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing.  She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president’s orders and copied his talk of an “invasion” at the U.S. border with Mexico.  As governor_ Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star_ which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost.  Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops “because of this invasion_” adding that “it is a war zone down there.”
283706886,President Trump fired 17 inspectors general_ the internal watchdogs who monitor federal agencies_ on Friday night_ capping a week of dramatic shake-ups of the federal bureaucracy with a focus on loyalty to the president_ three people with knowledge of the matter said.  The sweeping move did not affect Michael E. Horowitz_ the inspector general for the Justice Department_ according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. But inspectors general at several major agencies were believed to have been fired.  The Washington Post reported the firings earlier. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  People involved in the Trump transition had signaled such a shake-up was likely. And it is in keeping with an effort that Mr. Trump began in early 2020_ when he dismissed five inspectors general from their roles.
283659086,Aryna Sabalenka faces Madison Keys in the Australian Open final on Saturday_ Jan. 25_ 2025 (1/25/25) at Melbourne Park in Melbourne_ Victoria.  Fans can watch a majority of the action throughout the tournament for free via a trial of DirecTV Stream or fuboTV_ or via a subscription to Sling TV. Select windows can also be viewed on ESPN+.  Here’s what you need to know:  What: Australian Open  Who: Aryna Sabalenka vs. Madison Keys  When: Saturday_ Jan. 25_ 2025 (1/25/25  Where: Melbourne Park  Time: 3:30 a.m. ET  Live stream: DirecTV Stream_ fuboTV_ Sling TV  Here’s a recent AP story:  MELBOURNE_ Australia (AP) — The Madison Keys who will play two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka for the title at the Australian Open on Saturday night is not the same Madison Keys who was the runner-up at the U.S. Open back in 2017_ the one other time the American participated in a Grand Slam final.  Her racket is different_ for one thing_ a switch made ahead of this season to help protect her right shoulder and offer more controlled power. Her coach is different_ too_ as of 2023: her husband_ Bjorn Fratangelo. And her mindset is different_ Keys explained a little past 1 a.m. on Friday after upsetting Iga Swiatek in the semifinals at Melbourne Park.  The 6-3_ 6-0 loss at age 22 to her close friend Sloane Stephens at Arthur Ashe Stadium with a trophy at stake helped shape the way Keys will approach matters when she steps into Rod Laver Arena less than a month before her 30th birthday to face Sabalenka with another major title in the offing.  After that U.S. Open final_ in which she made 30 unforced errors_ Keys acknowledged not having “handled the occasion perfectly” and figured her performance “came down to nerves and all of that.”  The experience stuck with her.  “I’ve obviously thought of that match endlessly for the past eight years_” Keys said. “During that match_ I was so consumed with being nervous and the moment and the opportunity and all of that_ that I never really gave myself a chance to actually play.”  It took her a while to realize that the problem wasn’t so much the jitters themselves. Those are normal. Everyone feels them.  Instead_ she needed to learn not to worry about them and swing away.  “I’ve done a lot of work trying to NOT get rid of nerves_ because I think in the past_ in my head_ it was kind of always_ ‘The people who play amazing in the tight moments_ they either don’t have nerves or they figure out how to get rid of them_’” Keys explained.  “The big thing for me has just been knowing that there are going to be a lot of moments where I’m uncomfortable in the match. It’s going to be stressful. You have thousands of people watching you. You might not be playing your best tennis_” she said. “But instead of trying to shy away from that and search for settling or comfort or anything_ just being OK that that’s the situation — and you can also play tennis through that — is something that I’ve been working really hard on.”  And so there Keys was in the semifinals in Melbourne_ not merely in the crucible of a third set against a former No. 1 and five-time Grand Slam champion in Swiatek_ but even standing one point from defeat at 6-5_ 40-30.  The 19th-seeded Keys then trailed 8-7 in the third-set tiebreaker_ two points from defeat. She wouldn’t drop another point on the way to closing out the 5-7_ 6-1_ 7-6 (10-8) victory.  “At the end_ Madison was kind of brave with her decisions_” said Swiatek_ who lost more games to Keys in the semifinal than the 14 in her previous five matches combined.  Whatever self-doubt might have been present by Keys was masked rather effectively.  “That’s probably one of the biggest lessons that I can take from that U.S. Open final — just be OK with knowing that I’m probably going to be uncomfortable 99% of the time that I’m on the court_” Keys said_ “and that’s OK.”  Fratangelo_ a former professional player_ has emphasized to Keys that she needs to stick to her point-ending quick strikes.  When Keys went to a third set against 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina in the fourth round of this Australian Open_ Fratangelo reminded his wife of the need to stay aggressive.  His message?  “Don’t lose being passive_ because it’s not who you are. Let a counterpuncher lose being passive_ because that’s what they do_” he said. “You lose putting your foot on the gas pedal_ and that’s OK.”  That is also a perfect description of Sabalenka’s style. She’s learned to control her strokes_ and will mix in a slice or drop shot every so often_ mind you_ but the grunt-accompanied huge serves and groundstrokes are still her hallmarks.  As is her lack of hesitation.  “What’s really impressive is her mentality — her ability to kind of always go for it_ no matter what the score is_” Keys said.  Keys tries to emulate that aspect of the No. 1-seeded Sabalenka_ listed as a -325 money-line favorite_ according to BetMGM Sportsbook_ as she tries to become the first woman since Martina Hingis in 1997-99 with three consecutive Australian Open trophies.  “She plays such fearless tennis. She has the ability to play so well that way. It’s very unique_” said Keys_ whose 1-4 career record against Sabalanka includes a loss in the U.S. Open semifinals two years ago. “A lot of people_ no matter what_ even if it was a tight point_ you kind of expect them to play a little bit more conservative or back down a little bit_ and you know she’s not going to do that.”  Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

His energy_ creativity_ and commitment to the craft will never be forgotten.”  “We ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. We also want to thank everyone who has supported DJ Unk and the Oomp Camp over the years.”  Roberson_ “Rest in peace_ Unk. You will forever be missed. Now walk it out!”  In her Facebook post_ the rapper’s significant other asked for privacy.  “Please respect me and my family. I just lost my husband and my kids just lost their father_” Long-Platt wrote. “Our life will never be the same. I LOVE YOU ANTHONY FOREVER.”  DJ Unk rose to fame in the mid-2000s with his debut album_ “Beat’n Down Yo Block!” He had two breakout singles from the 2006 record — “Walk It Out_” which climbed into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart_ followed by “2 Step.”  A friend of the family told The Post_ “Unk never stopped touring and performing. No matter where you were_ when you heard Walk It Out_ you were guaranteed to start dancing.”  “‘Walk It Out’ and ‘2 Step’ remained two of the hottest songs on the planet. They will forever be considered legendary.”  The friend added_ “Unk was active in the studio up until the very end. Music was always near and dear to his heart.”  This is a developing story.
283947254,By Will Weissert and Zeke Miller | Associated Press  ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said Saturday he’d like to see Jordan_ Egypt and other Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip — potentially moving out enough of the population to “just clean out” the war-torn area to create virtual clean slate.  During a 20-minute question-and-answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday_ Trump said he discussed his vision on a call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt.  “I’d like him to take people. I’d like Egypt to take people_” said Trump. “You’re talking about_ probably a million and a half people_ and we just clean out that whole thing and say_ ‘You know it’s_ over.'”  Speaking about the effects of Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza_ Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king_ “I’d love for you to take on more_ cause I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now_ and it’s a mess. It’s a real mess.”  He said of such a mass movement of Palestinians_ “it could be temporary or long term_” adding that the area of the world that encompasses Gaza_ “over centuries” has “had many_ many conflicts.”  “Something has to happen_” Trump said. “But it’s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything’s demolished_ and people are dying there.” He added: “So_ I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations_ and build housing in a different location_ where they can maybe live in peace for a change.”
284045484,An inside look at the Commanders-Eagles NFC Championship showdown at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday afternoon:   Marquee matchup  Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels vs. Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson  Daniels is trying to add a layer to the best rookie quarterback season of all time by becoming the first to reach the Super Bowl.   Most of his throws go to 1_000-yard receiver Terry McLaurin_ but tight end Zach Ertz has re-emerged as a first look in the red zone late in his career.  Standing in their way is a ballhawk with six interceptions in each of his past two seasons playing for the Eagles (2022 and 2024).  Is it a coincidence that Daniels threw three of his five touchdown passes against the Eagles in Week 16 after Gardner-Johnson was ejected early in the third quarter for two personal-foul penalties? Johnson said afterward that he has to “grow the hell up.”  “I think he’s always known how important he is to the defense. We sure do_” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “He’s been just so good at taking the football away and playing with energy. He has an impact on games.”  Dunleavy’s decision  An argument can be made the Eagles’ roster is better at every position except the most important one_ where Daniels might already be the NFC’s best quarterback.  Saquon Barkley has been unstoppable all season — even more so against the Commanders (296 yards and four touchdowns on the ground in two games).   He and the four Pro Bowlers on the offensive line could win the game on their own.  Defensive tackle Jalen Carter took his Pro Bowl season to new heights with two sacks and a forced fumble last game.   Not a good first time for the Commanders to be without their best offensive lineman_ after right guard Sam Cosmi’s ACL injury.  Eagles 31_ Commanders 27  Hurts so good: Quarterback Jalen Hurts (knee) was a full participant in Thursday’s and Friday’s practices after he was limited Wednesday. His mobility clearly was limited at the end of last week’s win.   Hurts said his recovery is “progressing” but he “anticipates” wearing a knee brace. If he scrambles_ the Commanders won’t take sympathy.  “We are going to treat him like a running back_” defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. said. “We are going to hit him that way. That’s their decision if they want to get him hit the way that he gets hit.”  Tight end Dallas Goedert (ankle) is ready to go after not practicing Thursday. Center Cam Jurgens (back) is questionable.  For the Commanders_ defensive tackle Da’Ron Payne (knee_ finger) is out_ but linebacker Bobby Wagner (ankle) will play.  Revenge game: Brian Johnson was considered a rising star when the Eagles made the Super Bowl two years ago.   He was the quarterbacks coach responsible for Hurts’ rapid development into NFL MVP runner-up and offensive coordinator-in-waiting as soon as Shane Steichen left to be the Colts head coach.  Well_ Johnson’s one season calling plays was a disappointment. He was fired last January.   One year later_ Johnson is passing game coordinator for the Commanders under offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury during Jayden Daniels’ rookie-record-setting debut.  “Just being able to share some things he used with Jalen there in Philly — some things that worked_ some things he wishes he would’ve done differently — with Jayden has been huge_” Kingsbury said. “Because obviously that’s instant credibility of success they had there. He’s been a blessing for us.”  Third-and-8: With a win_ the Commanders will become just the third No. 6 seed to reach the playoffs and the third team to beat its conference’s top three seeds (No. 3 Buccaneers_ No. 1 Lions and No. 2 Eagles) en route to the Super Bowl.  Dan Quinn_ who previously took the 2016 Falcons to the Super Bowl_ would join Bill Parcells (Patriots_ Giants)_ Don Shula (Colts_ Dolphins)_ Dick Vermeil (Eagles_ Rams)_ John Fox (Panthers_ Broncos)_ Mike Holmgren (Packers_ Seahawks)_ Dan Reeves (Falcons_ Broncos) and Andy Reid (Chiefs_ Eagles) as the eighth head coach to lead multiple franchises to the Super Bowl.   Parcells_ Shula and Vermeil are Hall of Famers_ Holmgren is a current finalist_ Reeves is overdue for selection and Reid is a future lock.  Fourth-and-gutsy: The Commanders led the NFL during the regular season by converting nearly 87 percent of fourth downs (20-for-23).   Their 66.7 percent hit rate in the playoffs (6-for-9) against good defenses is even more impressive.  Quinn bypassed four field goals in the win against the Buccaneers_ turning 12 points into 14 when going 2-for-4 on fourth downs led to two touchdowns.   The Commanders’ three conversions against the Lions — one of the NFL’s most aggressive fourth-down teams — all led to touchdowns.  The Eagles converted 73 percent (19-for-26) during the regular season on the back of one of the most unstoppable plays in the NFL: the “Tush Push.” Nine out of 10 fourth-and-1 runs moved the chains.   One of coach Nick Sirianni’s four-year hallmarks is going for fourth downs in Eagles’ territory.  “I think the game flow and things like that will have an impact on it once you get into later moments_” Sirianni said. “That will be a key to the game on both ends.”
284054926,MELBOURNE_ Australia -- Jannik Sinner claimed his second consecutive Australian Open championship on Sunday_ never facing a single break point and using his complete game to outplay and frustrate Alexander Zverev for a 6-3_ 7-6 (4)_ 6-3 victory in the final.  Sinner_ a 23-year-old Italian_ is the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93.  Sinner rose to No. 1 last June_ remaining there for every week since_ and the gap between him and No. 2-ranked Zverev was pronounced as can be in Rod Laver Arena. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019_ when No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal -- also in straight sets.  Here's how dominant Sinner has been since the start of last season: He has won three of the five major tournaments_ including the US Open in September_ and his record in that span is 80-6 with a total of nine tournament titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches_ dating to last year.  The only thing that's clouded the past 12 months for Sinner_ it seems_ is a doping case in which he was cleared by a ruling that was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was exonerated in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April.  While Sinner became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals_ Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3_ adding this loss to those at the 2020 US Open and the 2024 French Open.  Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.  There truly was only one moment that felt as if it contained a hint of tension. It was late in the second set_ which Zverev was two points from owning when he led 5-4 and got to love-30 on Sinner's serve. But a break point -- and a set point -- never arrived there.  Zverev did not get closer_ dropping the next four points_ making it 5-all. Sinner then emerged with the ensuing tiebreaker. No surprise there: He went 4-0 in those set-deciders over the past two weeks and has grabbed 16 of his past 18.  A year ago_ Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first Slam_ needing to get past Djokovic -- who quit one set into his semifinal against Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring -- first_ before erasing a two-set deficit in the final against 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev.  Beating Zverev allowed Sinner to become the first man since Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later.
284034918,From his jail cell_ Mr. Yoon has vowed to fight to regain office.  A majority of South Koreans approved of his impeachment and consider him guilty of insurrection_ according to public opinion polls. But Mr. Yoon’s die-hard supporters have called his impeachment “fraud.” Some of them shocked the country when they vandalized a courthouse in Seoul after one of its judges approved a warrant to arrest him on Jan. 19. Nearly 60 people were arrested in connection with that unrest.  Prosecutors said that Mr. Yoon committed insurrection during the short-lived imposition of marital law when_ they said_ he banned all political activities and ordered military commanders to break the Assembly’s doors down “with axes” or “by shooting_ if necessary” and “drag out” lawmakers. They said Mr. Yoon sent the troops there to seize the Assembly and detain political leaders.  The nation watched the live-streamed scenes of special forces troops armed with assault rifles storming the Assembly as lawmakers were gathering there to vote against martial law. But Mr. Yoon has rejected the charge of insurrection_ saying that he never intended to neutralize the Parliament or arrest political leaders. The troops were there to “keep order_” he said.  Mr. Yoon’s indictment_ although not a surprise_ came sooner than expected.  State prosecutors have been investigating the former defense minister and generals. The country’s Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials took on the insurrection case against Mr. Yoon_ but by law_ only prosecutors can indict him.  Mr. Yoon has refused to cooperate with the inquiry; he and his lawyers have insisted that the four-year-old office has no right to investigate him.
283975214,LOS ANGELES (AP) — After weeks of windy and dry weather_ rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such as toxic ash runoff.  Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation_ shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires_ which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7.   Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days_ but “the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills_ the National Weather Service said on social media.   “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area_” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”   Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday_ forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas_ while snow was likely in the mountains.   Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities_ while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.  Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars_ electronics_ batteries_ building materials_ paints_ furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides_ asbestos_ plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.  Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018_ when the town of Montecito_ up the coast from LA_ was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.   While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity_ several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires_ which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14_000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.  In northern Los Angeles County_ firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire_ which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic.   In San Diego County_ there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.   The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year_ which began Oct. 1_ the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.   Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought_” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

283989336,Timothée Chalamet brought the house down as the host and musical guest of “Saturday Night Live.”  The actor_ who was just nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown_” solidified himself as a multitalented entertainer on the NBC sketch comedy show over the weekend.  In his opening monologue_ Chalamet poked fun at his failure to win trophies at Hollywood events over the years.  “It’s an enormous honor going to these award shows. It’s such a great experience_ but I just keep losing_ and each time it gets harder to pretend it doesn’t sting_” he quipped before a compilation video showed his reactions to coming up short to Gary Oldman and Mahershala Ali.  “But the most embarrassing part is I’ve had this sad little speech in my pocket for four years that I’ve never gotten a chance to read_” Chalamet added.  The “Wonka” star_ 29_ also performed Dylan’s songs “Outlaw Blues_” “Three Angels” and “Tomorrow Is a Long Time” — accompanied by James Blake on the piano — after playing the musician in the biopic_ which premiered in December 2024.  Chalamet said Dylan’s music and career have been a “guiding light” to him.  Chalamet teased his “SNL” appearance earlier this week with a hilarious promotional video involving his look-alikes. The teaser was a callback to the headline-making moment when he showed up to a “Timothée Chalamet look-alike contest” in New York City last October.  Chalamet’s girlfriend_ Kylie Jenner_ was not shown in audience after recently joining him for a romantic getaway in Paris last week.  The Kylie Cosmetics founder_ 27_ has been a huge supporter of Chalamet’s acting career and was by his side at the 2025 Golden Globes earlier this month.  Page Six exclusively reported that Jenner was thrilled over her beau’s best actor Oscar nomination for his role in “A Complete Unknown.”  The honor marks the second time Chalamet has been up for the coveted award as he received a nomination in the same category for his 2018 breakout film_ “Call Me By Your Name.”  Our source told us the makeup mogul was “screaming with excitement” when he received the news and “had a feeling Timothée was going to be nominated.”  “Actually seeing his name pop up on the TV screen was incredible_” the insider added.  The source also told Page Six that Jenner is “ecstatic” and “so proud of him” for being nominated again.  “Kylie is absolutely thrilled and can’t wait to see Timothée in person so they can celebrate this special moment in his life_” the insider shared.  The lovebirds were first romantically linked in 2023. While Jenner and Chalamet initially kept their romance private_ they have since shown plenty of PDA at public events like the US Open and a star-studded Beyoncé concert.  The duo have yet to make their official red carpet debut as a couple. However_ sources previously told us that Jenner never wants to take the moment away from Chalamet at events related to his projects.
284141280,President Trump fumed on Sunday after Colombia turned back two US military flights carrying deported migrants — vowing to impose sanctions and an “emergency 25% tariff” on the South American country.  “I was just informed that two repatriation flights from the United States_ with a large number of Illegal Criminals_ were not allowed to land in Colombia_” Trump wrote Sunday.  “This order was given by Colombia’s Socialist President Gustavo Petro_ who is already very unpopular amongst his people_” he said_ adding that Petro’s decision has “jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States.”  In response_ the president said he would enacted the “emergency 25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States_” adding that it would be raised to 50% in a week.  He also called for a travel ban_ visa revocations on Colombian government officials_ visa sanctions on party members and government supporters_ enhanced customs and border protection inspections of any Colombian national and banking and financial sanctions.  “These measures are just the beginning_” Trump said. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!”  The angry post came after Petro blocked the military jets’ arrival.  In a social media post_ Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t slam the door on deportation flights.  Instead_ he demanded the US use civilian planes and create better protocols for how it treats deportees.  Colombian migrants can’t stay in a country that doesn’t want them_ he conceded.  But they must be returned “with dignity and respect for them and for our country_” he said.  “We will receive our fellow citizens on civilian planes_ without treating them like criminals.”

284074472,At the beginning of the season_ plenty of people would have predicted that the Eagles would reach the NFC Championship Game. Few could have predicted the Commanders would make it_ considering many didn't expect them to even get into the playoffs.  Now_ Washington shouldn't be overlooked. With rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels powering one impressive win after another_ the Commanders are a legitimate threat to win the NFC title and make their first Super Bowl appearance since the 1991 season.  The sportsbooks may be disrespecting Washington a bit based on the sizable spread.  This game should be closer than the betting line indicates. The Eagles and the Commanders played a pair of competitive contests during the regular season_ and this should be another one that comes down to the fourth quarter.  The X-factor for the matchup could be Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts' injured left knee. It's possible the 26-year-old will wear a brace for the game_ and it's unknown how that could potentially impact his mobility.  Hurts missed a large chunk of the Eagles' Week 16 matchup at Washington due to a concussion_ and a Kenny Pickett-led Philadelphia squad couldn't hold on for a win.  As long as Hurts can play all of Sunday's game_ the Eagles remain the favorite. And they should find a way to win_ especially because of how much trouble opposing defenses have had trying to stop star running back Saquon Barkley.  The Commanders know Barkley well_ and they've seen firsthand how he can take over a game many times. He should break at least one long touchdown run on Sunday_ as he frequently does.  Washington won't go down without a fight_ and the margin of Philadelphia's victory will be fewer than six points. So expect an exciting game that eventually goes in the Eagles' favor_ as they'll head to the Super Bowl for the third time in eight seasons.  Prediction: Eagles 32_ Commanders 28  Gambling problem?

284196878,Always rooting for the guy on the Chiefs.   Taylor Swift celebrated a Kansas City Chiefs touchdown against the Buffalo Bills during Sunday’s AFC Championship game.  The pop star wrapped her mom_ Andrea_ in a hug after wide receiver Xavier Worthy leapt into the end zone to give the Chiefs a second-quarter lead over the Bills.   The Swifts then encouraged Travis Kelce’s mom_ Donna_ to join them in their celebration.   Donna reached her arm out and gave Andrea and Taylor a squeeze.   Follow Page Six’s Taylor Swift live updates for the latest news_ photos_ fan theories and more  Swift_ who wore head-to-toe Louis Vuitton to the game — was also accompanied by her dad_ Scott_ and brother_ Austin.  The “Fortnight” singer_ 35_ was in the stands at Arrowhead Stadium last weekend when the Chiefs beat the Houston Texans_ 23-14.  Swift brought a star-studded entourage along for the big game — including Brooke Shields and WNBA star Caitlin Clark_ who is a longtime Swiftie.   The 14-time Grammy winner_ who wore a pricey head-to-toe Chanel outfit_ was seen adorably copying Kelce’s first down signal and going crazy after he scored a touchdown.   Although the couple — who began dating last summer — celebrated the win that night_ Swift flew back to New York City on Monday so that Kelce could focus on the highly anticipated AFC championship.  The winner of Sunday’s match-up will face off against the Philadelphia Eagles_ who beat the Washington Commanders earlier in the day_ in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9.  The Missouri-based squad is vying for it’s third straight Super Bowl appearance after taking home the hardware in 2024 and 2023. They also won in 2020.  Meanwhile_ the Bills have never raised the coveted Lombardi Trophy_ with their last Super Bowl appearance falling over 30 years ago.   Whoever wins will have an extra week off before the big game_ meaning Swift could attend the Grammys on Feb. 2 and the Super Bowl the following week if the Chiefs come out victorious.   However_ like last year_ Kelce likely wouldn’t be able to join her at the awards show given the strict schedule leading up to the game. Both AFC and NFC teams are expected to be in New Orleans one week before the Super Bowl for practice and media.
284259016,The world marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday_ with some of the few remaining survivors set to attend ceremonies at the site of the notorious Nazi death camp.Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews_ one million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945_ along with more than 100_000 non-Jews.On Monday former inmates_ along with Polish President Andrzej Duda_ are expected to lay flowers at the sprawling camp's Wall of Death in the morning.Around 50 survivors are then expected at a commemoration from 1500 GMT outside the gates of Auschwitz II-Birkenau alongside dozens of leaders_ including Britain's King Charles III and French President Emmanuel Macron.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Olaf Scholz are both expected_ as well as Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch."This year we will focus on the survivors and their message_" Auschwitz Museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki told AFP. "There will not be any speeches by politicians."Speaking to AFP ahead of the anniversary_ survivors around the world spoke about the need to preserve the memory of what happened when there will no longer be living witnesses.They also warned about rising hatred and anti-Semitism around the world and spoke of their fears about history repeating itself.Organisers said it could be the last major anniversary with such a large group of survivors."We all know that in 10 years it will not be possible to have a large group for the 90th anniversary_" Sawicki said.Auschwitz was created in 1940 using barracks in Oswiecim_ southern Poland. Its name was Germanised into Auschwitz by the Nazis.The first 728 Polish political prisoners arrived on June 14 of that year.On January 17_ 1945_ as Soviet troops advanced_ the SS forced 60_000 emaciated prisoners to walk west in what became known as the "Death March".From January 21-26_ the Germans blew up the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria and withdrew as Soviet troops approached.On January 27_ Soviet troops arrived_ finding 7_000 survivors.The day of its liberation has been designated by the United Nations as Holocaust Remembrance Day.Until its invasion of Ukraine in 2022_ a Russian delegation had always attended the annual liberation ceremony but Moscow will be barred again this year.There has also been controversy following rumours about the possibility that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could attend the ceremony.The International Criminal Court last year issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on suspicion of crimes against humanity and war crimes over the war in Gaza.After a request from Duda_ the Polish government confirmed last month that it would not arrest Netanyahu if he were to visit_ even though the Israeli leader has not expressed any intentions to attend.Some 40 survivors of the Nazi camps agreed to talk to AFP in the run up to the anniversary.In 15 countries_ from Israel to Poland_ Russia to Argentina_ Canada to South Africa they sat in front of our cameras to tell their stories_ alone or surrounded by their children_ grandchildren and great grandchildren -- proof of their victory over absolute evil."How did the world allow Auschwitz?" asked 95-year-old Marta Neuwirth from Santiago_ Chile.She was 15 when she was sent from Hungary to Auschwitz.Julia Wallach_ who is nearly 100_ has difficulty talking about what happened without crying."It is too difficult to talk about_ too hard_" she said. The Parisian was dragged off a lorry destined for the gas chamber in Birkenau at the last minute.But hard as it is to relive the horrors_ she insisted she would continue to give witness."As long as I can do it_ I will do it." Beside her_ her granddaughter Frankie asked: "Will they believe us when we talk about this when she is not there?"That is why Esther Senot_ 97_ braved the Polish winter last month to go back to Birkenau with French high school students. She was keeping a promise she made in 1944 to her dying sister Fanny_ who -- laid out on the straw coughing up blood -- asked her with her last breath to "tell what happened to us so that we are not forgotten by history".
284393176,Big technology stocks including Nvidia_ Microsoft_ Meta and Tesla tumbled in premarket trading on concerns that a Chinese artificial intelligence startup could threaten America’s dominance in AI.  Shares of Nvidia plunged nearly 12% on news reports about the capabilities of DeepSeek — a China-based startup which has made waves in the industry after launching a free_ open-source large-language model in December.  DeepSeek was reportedly developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a stark contrast to the billions of dollars typically spent by Western tech giants on AI research and infrastructure.  The developments triggered a global sell-off_ particularly impacting semiconductor firms_ as fears mounted over the sustainability of US dominance in the sector.  Shares of Nvidia_ a key player in AI-driven chip design and a significant beneficiary of the AI boom_ plummeted 11.8% as of 07:05 a.m. Eastern Time before the market opened on Monday.  Microsoft_ which has plowed billions of dollars into Sam Altman’s OpenAI_ the company behind ChatGPT_ was off 4.1% in premarket trading. Shares of Meta were off 1.7% while Tesla saw its share price drop by more than 2.7% in pre-market trading.  European chipmakers also faced sharp declines_ with Netherlands-based ASML and ASM International falling 8.9% and 13.6%_ respectively.  Meanwhile_ Nasdaq futures have tumbled 2.3%_ S&P 500 futures have declined 1.3% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have decreased by 0.9% before the opening bell on Monday.  The rapid progress of DeepSeek has sparked scrutiny over the immense sums being funneled into AI research by leading US firms_ raising questions about efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive_” said Srini Pajjuri_ a semiconductor analyst at Raymond James_ in a note on Monday.  Meanwhile_ analysts at Citi recognize that DeepSeek’s technological strides have raised investor questions about the cost of computational power.  However_ they emphasize that American companies still maintain a significant advantage due to their access to the most sophisticated chips.  “While the dominance of US companies in the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged_ their access to high-end GPUs remains a key differentiator_” Citi analysts stated in a note.  The market turbulence coincides with a broader push by the US government to reinforce AI leadership.  President Trump recently announced a $500 billion AI initiative known as Stargate.  The vast sum of money being invested in the project_ which includes the involvement of top firms such as OpenAI_ Oracle and SoftBank_ underscores the strategic importance of advanced chips in maintaining American competitiveness in AI development.

284256622,BOGOTA_ Colombia — The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday_ hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner.  Long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts_ the U.S. and Colombia clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a show of what other countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The White House held up the episode as a warning to other nations who might seek to impede his plans.  Earlier_ the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions_ 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods_ which would be raised to 50% in one week_ and other retaliatory measures sparked by President Gustavo Petro's decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants after Petro accused Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation. Petro also announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods.  Trump said the measures were necessary because Petro's decision "jeopardized" national security in the U.S. by blocking the deportation flights.  "These measures are just the beginning_" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. "We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States."  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late Sunday statement that the "Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms_ including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States_ including on U.S. military aircraft_ without limitation or delay."  Leavitt said the tariff orders will be "held in reserve_ and not signed." But Leavitt said Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country_ "until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned."  The Colombian government late Sunday said it considered as "overcome" the episode with the Trump administration and Petro reposted the statement from the White House on X.  "We have overcome the impasse with the United States government_" said Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. "We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees_ guaranteeing them decent conditions as citizens subject to rights."  Murillo added that the South American country's presidential aircraft is available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes.  Earlier Sunday_ U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families "who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations." They were being imposed on top of the State Department's move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia's capital_ Bogota.  Petro had said earlier that his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with "dignity." Petro made the announcement in two X posts_ one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.  "A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves_" Petro said. "That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes_ without being treated like criminals_ we will receive our fellow citizens."  After Trump's earlier tariff threat_ Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the "foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%."  Colombia has traditionally been the U.S.'s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro_ a former guerrilla_ became Colombia's first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S.  Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024_ fifth behind Guatemala_ Honduras_ Mexico and El Salvador_ according to Witness at the Border_ an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.  Colombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.  The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.  "This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights_" a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly.  Rubio in a statement said Petro "canceled his authorization" for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.  Colombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico_ aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127_604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September_ behind Mexicans_ Guatemalans and Venezuelans.  Mexico hasn't imposed visa restrictions on Colombians_ as they have on Venezuelans_ Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.  Petro's government in a statement later announced that the South American country's presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them "dignified conditions."  As part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration_ his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations.  Two U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day_ Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.  Colombia is the U.S.'s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil_ shipping about 209_000 barrels of oil per day last year_ although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.' dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.'s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers.

284354344,LOS ANGELES (AP) — More rain fell Monday on parts of Southern California after causing mudflows over the weekend_ helping firefighters but boosting the risk of toxic ash runoff in areas scorched by Los Angeles-area wildfires.  Flood watches were in effect for burn areas from recent fires that broke out around the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles_ Altadena and Castaic Lake_ said Joe Sirard_ a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.  “All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff_” Sirard said_ warning of even small amounts of rain in a few minutes’ time. “What that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows once we get above those thresholds.”  A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County was closed as of Sunday afternoon due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon_ the California Department of Transportation said. Snow fell in the mountains.  One benefit that could come from the rain: It may help firefighters who are reining in multiple wildfires after weeks of windy and dry weather.  Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation_ shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires_ which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on Jan. 7.   The Palisades Fire_ the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people_ reached 90% containment Sunday. The Eaton Fire_ which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 16 people_ was 98% contained.  The Hughes Fire_ which ignited last week north of Los Angeles and caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50_000 people_ was 95% contained as of Sunday evening.  In San Diego County_ firefighters made progress to contain the smaller Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.   Most of the region was forecast to get about an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days_ but the weather service warned of a risk of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills.   “So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area_” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said on social media. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”   Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.  Fire crews filled sandbags for communities_ while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.  Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars_ electronics_ batteries_ building materials_ paints_ furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides_ asbestos_ plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.  Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018_ when the town of Montecito_ up the coast from Los Angeles_ was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.   The rain snapped a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought_” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

284575624,The White House budget office is ordering a pause to all grants and loans disbursed by the federal government_ according to an internal memo sent to agencies Monday_ creating significant confusion across Washington.  In a two-page document_ Matthew J. Vaeth_ the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget_ instructs federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.” The memo_ a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post_ also calls for each agency to perform a “comprehensive analysis” to ensure its grant and loan programs are consistent with President Donald Trump’s executive orders_ which aimed to ban federal diversity_ equity and inclusion initiatives_ and limit clean energy spending_ among other measures.
284550474,Google is saying goodbye to the Gulf of Mexico. Moving forward_ Google Maps will call it the Gulf of America_ the tech giant announced on Monday_ a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming it on his first day back in office.  “We have received a few questions about naming within Google Maps_” Google posted on X. “We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.”  Google also said it would be changing Denali — the tallest mountain in North America — back to Mt. McKinley_ following a different executive order from Trump. The Alaska mountain had been renamed in 2015 to Denali by then-President Barack Obama; it was initially named after President William McKinley in 1896.  The new changes had not gone into effect on Google Maps by Monday afternoon; Google said it would be updating its app “quickly” to reflect the new names.   Interestingly_ Google said that while American users will see the “official local name_” users “in the rest of the world see both names” for the locations.  The changes come after Sundar Pichai_ the CEO of Alphabet_ Google’s parent company_ sat behind President Trump at his inauguration last week. A number of other tech execs — including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg_ Tesla and X boss Elon Musk_ Apple CEO Tim Cook_ and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — were there alongside Pichai. You can read more about their trip to Washington_ D.C._ and what Trump fans thought about their support_ by clicking here.
284600290,Jan. 27 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday night to reshape the military as he focused on transgender service members; diversity_ equity and inclusion programs; troops who refused COVID-19 vaccines and a missile defense system called the "Iron Dome."  The president signed the four executive orders aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington_ D.C._ after speaking at a House GOP retreat in Florida.  While Trump did not immediately ban transgender service members from the armed forces_ his executive order directs the Pentagon to come up with a policy for transgender troops based on readiness.  "To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world_ we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone_" Trump told House Republicans on Monday at his property in Doral_ Fla.  Trump's second executive order bans the use of DEI_ race or "gender ideologies" in the military. Last week_ Trump signed an executive order to end DEI programs throughout the federal government_ placing DEI workers on paid leave.  "I ordered the end to all of the lawless diversity_ equity and inclusion nonsense policies across the government and all across the private sector and the military_" Trump said Monday. "We're getting it out and we've gotten out pretty much. We did that in one week_ and it wasn't easy_ but everybody wanted it."  Earlier Monday_ newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters outside of the Pentagon that reinstating troops who resisted the COVID-19 mandates and creating a missile defense system were also among Trump's executive orders.  "Today_ there are more executive orders coming_ ... on removing DEI inside the Pentagon_ reinstating troops who were pushed out because of Covid mandates_ iron dome for America."  "This is happening quickly_ and as the secretary of defense_ it's an honor to salute smartly_ as I did as a junior officer and now as the secretary of defense_ to ensure these orders are complied with rapidly and quickly_" Hegseth added.  Hegseth was confirmed Friday as defense secretary by a narrow margin of 51-50 in the U.S. Senate with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Monday marked his first official week on the job.  Trump's third executive order directs Hegseth to reinstate all active and reserve military_ who were discharged for failing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The service members will be reinstated with their former rank and provided back pay and benefits. Approximately 8_000 service members were discharged between August 2021 and January 2023 for refusing COVID-19 mandates.  The fourth executive order would begin the process of creating a "next generation" short-range missile defense shield for the United States_ much like Israel's Iron Dome.  To "immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield_ which will be able to protect Americans_" Trump added. The project is expected to take years.  Shortly after his inauguration last week_ Trump signed an executive order_ recognizing only two genders_ male and female. The president also revoked an executive order signed by former President Joe Biden in 2021 that allowed transgender people to serve in the military.  "It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery_ which often involves the use of heavy narcotics_" according to a fact sheet read by an official Monday_ according to CNN. "During this period_ they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements."  Independent research institute the Palm Center found in 2018 that there were an estimated 14_000 transgender service members in the U.S. military.  During his first term_ Trump made exceptions for transgender service members already serving in uniform before his ban took effect_ including for those who do not require a gender change and those who had been "stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession_" according to a Pentagon memo dated Feb. 22_ 2018.  On Monday_ officials with Veterans Affairs announced its "initial implementation" of Trump's executive order to end DEI programs and put 60 employees on paid leave.  "Under President Trump_ VA is laser-focused on providing the best possible care and benefits to veterans_ their families_ caregivers and survivors_" said VA director of Media Affairs Morgan Ackley.  "We are proud to have abandoned the divisive DEI policies of the past and pivot back to VA's core mission."

284547824,Justin Baldoni appeared to be heard apologizing to Blake Lively in a lengthy 2 a.m. voice note after they allegedly disagreed over the “It Ends With Us” rooftop scene.  “Hey_ Blake … hopefully_ this does not wake you up_” the “Jane the Virgin” star was allegedly heard saying in the message sent around April 2023_ per audio obtained by the Daily Mail Monday.  “There’s so much I want to say to you_ and I hope that we can FaceTime_ or see each other in person soon … but I’m just going to send you a few thoughts.”  “I want to start with an apology_” Baldoni_ 41_ purportedly said_ explaining that his “heart sank” when he read a text message Lively had sent about “not always [being] good” at ensuring she is seen and instead bowing down to “threatening egos” out of “fear of affecting the ease of the process.”  “I for sure fell short and you worked really hard on that_ and the way you framed it_ and how that made you feel … I just wanted to say thank you for sharing that with me_” the audio continued.   “That takes a lot of trust and vulnerability_ and I feel really grateful that you feel safe enough to tell me that that’s how you feel and share that with me. I f–ked up.”   “One thing you should know about me is that I will admit and apologize when I fail_” Baldoni added_ per the audio. “I am far from perfect. I’m a very flawed man_ as my wife will attest.”  “I’m gonna f–k up. I’m going to say the wrong thing. I’m going to put my foot in my mouth … but I will always apologize and find my way back to center…”  “I’m sorry I made you feel that way. That must have felt terrible. I will for sure do better. That was not my best weekend and I should’ve given it more time.”   Baldoni purportedly also discussed when Lively_ 37_ invited him over to her and Ryan Reynolds’ New York City penthouse_ where Taylor Swift was present and allegedly raved over her script rewrites.   According to the filmmaker’s $400 million defamation and extortion lawsuit against the “Gossip Girl” alum and Reynolds_ Lively referred to her husband and the 14-time Grammy winner as “absolute titans” and “dragons” who will protect her in battle.  “And damn right you got great friends if that’s how you felt and they knew that_” the audio message continued. “We should all have friends like that_ aside from the fact that they are two of the most creative people on the planet. The three of you guys together_ it’s unbelievable. Talk about energy and just a force.”   Baldoni also appeared to insist he didn’t need the “Deadpool” star_ 48_ or Swift_ 35_ to tell him how good Lively’s work was_ allegedly saying in the audio_ “Because [the rewrites are] really good and it’s going to make the movie sing like you said. I’m excited to go through the whole movie with you.”  Per the audio_ the “Five Feet Apart” director shared that he and Lively have successfully built their relationship_ but admitted that communicating via text and voice notes wasn’t his “biggest strength.”   “I love being with people and being in somebody’s face and face to face_” he purportedly said. “I feel like that’s where I excel and I’ve definitely fallen short in our texting … because there is so much to communicate and so much happening.”  “All that to say_ I’m just looking forward to spending time together and I think that’s really going to go a long way for our chemistry_ which I believe is there_ [and] has been there from the start.”  “I was so damn excited when you wanted to do this film_ I felt it in the room when we met and I think it does come from the both of us being so f–king hard-working_ and having a vision and not settling. I’m excited to have a creative partner in that with you.”   Baldoni allegedly shared he had so much more to say to the “A Simple Favor” star and apologized on behalf of “filmmakers and producers” for what she’s been through.  “Those f–kheads_” he said_ per the audio. “I’m just still kinda blown away that this is the industry that we’re in and that you’ve experienced that as a woman.”  “And no I don’t need to say it but … hopefully that’s not going to be the experience with me.”  He also reassured the “Age of Adaline” star that there was “no hesitancy” in sending her the final draft of the script_ which is based on Colleen Hoover’s 2016 book about domestic violence.   “The only reason I didn’t send it today was because I was trying to implement and add your notes into my working draft … I just haven’t had a chance to send it to you_” Baldoni said.  The “My Last Days” producer shared he hopes the movie experience would be “healing” to Lively “in some way_” adding_ “That’s all I want.”  “I want this movie to be commercial just like you and affect people and touch people and I want to walk you through my whole plan and the work we are doing with the domestic violence partner that we found … and just my vision.”  “I just know this can be really really special and it’s going to be special_ and you’re the secret sauce_” he continued_ per the audio.  “I hope you’re feeling better. Give Ryan my love for sending me that_” Baldoni added_ alluding that he also received a text message from Reynolds.   “It means the world to me that you trust me with your feelings and your thoughts. I can’t wait to spend more time with you.”  Reps for Baldoni and Lively weren’t immediately available to Page Six for comment.   The voice memo is the latest update to Baldoni and Lively’s ongoing legal battle after she accused her co-star and director of sexual harassment and retaliation last month.  Baldoni denied the allegations and filed a lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds on Jan. 16.   The famous couple has since requested a gag order but Baldoni’s lawyer_ Bryan Freedman_ has said that he refuses to be “bullied” into silence.
284752524,By CHRIS MEGERIAN_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is pausing federal grants and loans starting on Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s administration begins an across-the-board ideological review of its spending.  The decision by the Republican administration could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research_ education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted.  “The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity_ transgenderism_ and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve_” said a memo from Matthew Vaeth_ the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.  The pause takes effect at 5 p.m. ET_ and it’s unclear from the memo how sweeping it will be.

Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Rose DeLauro_ the top Democrats on the Senate and House appropriations committees_ expressed “extreme alarm” in a letter to Vaeth.  “This Administration’s actions will have far-reaching consequences for nearly all federal programs and activities_ putting the financial security of our families_ our national security_ and the success of our country at risk_” they wrote.

Trump also sat down with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Wednesday_ where the pair discussed issues ranging from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to hurricanes and wildfires under the Biden administration and declaring that his return to the White House serves as evidence that policies from the "radical left" do not work and were rejected by voters.

285016768,WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday will sign the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration's first piece of legislation. It mandates the detention and potential deportation of people in the U.S. illegally who are accused of theft and violent crimes before they've actually been convicted.  The measure swiftly passed the Republican-controlled Congress with some Democratic support_ despite immigrants rights advocates decrying it as extreme enough to possibly trigger mass roundups of people for offenses as minor as shoplifting.   Trump has made a promised crackdown on illegal immigration unprecedented in the nation's history a centerpiece of his political career_ however_ and is now suggesting the law might only be the beginning.   “This shows the potential for additional enforcement bills that will help us crack down on criminal aliens and totally restore the rule of law in our country_" the president said at a conference of House Republicans held at his Doral golf club in Florida.   The law is named for Laken Riley_ a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who went out for a run in February 2024 and was killed by Jose Antonio Ibarra_ a Venezuelan national in the U.S. illegally. Ibarra was found guilty in November and sentenced to life without parole.  “To have a bill of such importance named after her is a great_ a great tribute_” Trump said. “This new form of crime_ criminal_ illegal aliens_ it’s — it’s massive_ the numbers are massive and you add that to the crime we already had.”   The speed at which the act cleared Congress — and the fact that Trump is preparing to triumphantly sign it at the White House surrounded by lawmakers and other supportive_ invited guests just nine days after taking office — adds to its potent political symbolism for conservatives. Critics say the measure is using a tragedy to effectively unleash chaos and cruelty while doing little to fight crime or fix an antiquated federal immigration system that hasn't been overhauled in decades.   Under the Laken Riley Act_ federal officials are required to detain any immigrant arrested or charged with crimes like theft or assaulting a police officer_ or offenses that injure or kill someone. It further gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue the U.S. government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions — potentially allowing the leaders of conservative states to help dictate immigration policy set by Washington.   Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso_ Texas_ amid an unprecedented surge in migration_ and released to pursue his case in immigration court. Federal officials say he was arrested by New York police in August 2023 for child endangerment and released. Police say he was also suspected of theft in Georgia in October 2023 — all of which occurred before Riley's killing.   “This is the right thing to do_” House Speaker Mike Johnson_ R-La._ said after the act cleared the House. “It’s always good when the right thing is also the popular thing.”  Some Democrats_ however_ have questioned the act's constitutionality. Immigrant advocates are bracing for mass detentions that they say will trigger subsequent_ costly construction of immigration lockup facilities to house the people arrested.   “They don’t just get to celebrate. They get to use this for their mass deportation agenda_” Naureen Shah_ deputy director of government affairs in the equality division of the American Civil Liberties Union_ said of the act's supporters.  The ALCU says the act can allow people to be “mandatorily locked up — potentially for years — because at some point in their lives_ perhaps decades ago_ they were accused of nonviolent offenses.”  Hannah Flamm_ interim senior director of policy at the International Refugee Assistance Project_ said the law violates immigrants' basic rights by allowing for detaining people who haven’t been charged with_ much less convicted of_ wrongdoing. Still_ she said_ “The latent fear from the election cycle of looking soft on crime snowballed into aiding and abetting Trump’s total conflation of immigration with crime."  Flamm said the act is likely to be challenged in court on its parameters directing mandatory detentions_ as well as its granting legal standing to state attorneys general in immigration cases and policy. But she also predicted that a need to pay for more immigration detention centers will give advocates a chance to challenge how federal funds are appropriated to cover those costs.   “I think it is pivotal to understand: This bill_ framed as connected to a tragic death_ is pretext to fortify a mass deportation system_” Flamm said.   The signing of the Laken Riley Act follows a flurry of first-week executive orders by Trump that are designed to better seal off the U.S.-Mexico border and eventually move to deport millions of immigrants without permanent U.S. legal status. The new administration has also canceled refugee resettlement and says it may attempt to prosecute local law enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration policies.  “We’re tracking down the illegal alien criminals and we’re detaining them and we’re throwing them the hell out of our country_" Trump said. "We have no apologies_ and we’re moving forward very fast.”
285140786,Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are back at Katz’s Deli — and we’ll have what they’re having.   More than 35 years after When Harry Met Sally introduced one of the most-quoted scenes in rom-com history_ Ryan and Crystal reunited in a Super Bowl commercial for Hellmann’s.   The ad sees the pair reviving the 1989 movie’s title characters at the New York City deli_ where Harry tells Sally_ “I can’t believe they let us back in this place.”   “Why?” Sally asks_ to which he responds_ “Hello …”   “Nobody remembers that_” Sally insists.   They’re_ of course_ referring to the classic movie moment where Harry says he doesn’t believe any of the women he’s slept with have ever faked an orgasm and Sally proceeds to offer a convincing demonstration right in the middle of the restaurant. “I’ll have what she’s having_” deadpans a fellow diner. (Trivia alert: It's actually the director Rob Reiner's mother_ Estelle_ who delivers the now-famous line.)   The ad then shows the duo bite into their respective sandwiches_ but Sally admits hers “isn’t doing it.”   The solution? Sally squeezes a healthy serving of Hellmann’s mayonnaise onto her rye bread_ and signals her approval by re-enacting her famous performance with gusto. “This one’s real_” Billy remarks. Actress Sydney Sweeney makes a cameo to deliver the “I’ll have what she’s having” catchphrase.   Crystal tells PEOPLE the timing was right to revisit the beloved movie_ written by the late Nora Ephron.   “It was our 35th anniversary of the film_ and it's the first time that we've been offered something like that_” he says. “It was a really fun idea_ and the approach was right.”   “They were so respectful of the movie and of the scene too_” Ryan tells PEOPLE of Hellmann’s. “They came to us with just an enormous amount of respect for that_ for the source material and for the characters.”   And as for sitting across the table from each other at the famed N.Y.C. deli once again_ Crystal says_ “It felt the same.”   Ryan remembers the shoot for the original Katz’s scene lasting “all day_” during which she experienced “a lot of trepidation and nerves.”   “Initially_ it was like_ ‘Oh_ what are these sounds going to be?’ All the levels. I don't know if I'm going to get help_” she recalls.   Fortunately_ Reiner offered her plenty of guidance. “Rob had so many significant and interesting sounds to inspire me with_” Ryan says.   Crystal recalls: “He did one and he took me aside and he said_ ‘Oh_ I shouldn't have done that. I just had an orgasm in front of my mother.”   Both actors agreed Sweeney did the line justice in the commercial.   “She's adorable_” Crystal says of the Anyone But You star. “That's a big deal. It's an iconic line and it's a big honor to get to do that. And a heavy burden.”   “It was game and fun and loose and ballsy and just seemed to be having a blast while she was there_” Ryan adds. “She's a completely adorable person.”   The pair also reflected on why the Katz’s scene has continued to resonate in pop culture for more than three decades.   “Back then_ no one had ever attempted to talk about that_” Crystal says_ noting it evolved from a script meeting_ during which the “concept of women faking orgasms” came up. “I think it just took everyone's breath away.”   Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer_ from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.   Ryan says it’s “really just a well-constructed scene.”   “It pays off the way both Sally's funny is behavioral_ Harry's funny is more verbal and reactive_” she explains. “That was important_ how Billy reacted to her. So it just sort of pulled all together in one scene_ everything about the characters and sort of delivered on the promise of the premise.”   “And she teaches him a lesson at the same time_” Crystal adds. “And doesn't care where she is_ doesn't care that people are watching.”   A teaser for the Hellmann’s commercial_ released last week_ paid tribute to Sally’s notoriously detailed ordering style when eating out.   “I didn't know that you could order like that until I played Sally_” Ryan says. “I didn't realize that you could be that specific. When I was in New York_ I never did that. … In L.A._ there was more sort of acceptance of tailoring your order. Now_ of course_ everyone does it.”   “That was a real Nora thing though_” Crystal notes of Ephron.   “She made it more permissible_” Ryan adds.

Tyler Sabapathy_ 18_ was a first-year student at Temple University's College of Public Health_ the university said in a statement. Sabapathy climbed a pole at 15th and Market streets and fell_ sources told CBS News Philadelphia."There are no words that can make sense of it_ and the entire Temple community mourns his passing. Our hearts go out to Tyler's family_ friends_ classmates and all who knew and loved him_" the university said in a statement. A native of Toronto_ Canada_ Sabapathy was majoring in exercise science and sport science and was a member of the school's club gymnastics team. Temple said in a statement students can seek help from Tuttleman Counseling Services and faculty and staff can get support 24/7 from the employee assistance program. Philadelphia police said there were 31 citations for disorderly conduct or failure to disperse and four assaults on police with two arrests Sunday night. Other incidents include a person who shot a gun into the air and two shootings_ and the front of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office was vandalized_ according to police.
284926846,A lawsuit by the National Council of Nonprofits led to a federal judge pausing an order by President Donald Trump to freeze some federal funds in order to root out ideological spending from the budget.   U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan issued the temporary pause in the spending freeze just minutes before it was set to go into effect at 5 p.m. on Tuesday. The administrative stay only applies to already existing programs and will only last until Monday afternoon.   'The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity_ transgenderism_ and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars.'    “It seems like the federal government currently doesn’t actually know the full extent of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause_" said AliKhan in her ruling.   The freeze was communicated to federal departments through a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that explained it was necessary to ensure funds were no longer being used for ideological purposes.   "The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity_ transgenderism_ and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve_" read the memo.  Earlier in the day_ Democrats claimed the spending freeze led to a "constitutional crisis" after payments to the Medicare website portal were reportedly down. The White House later said that there was an unrelated outage at the website portal.   "We must state the truth: this is a constitutional crisis. It’s a massive_ illegal power grab that the House and Senate have a sworn duty to stop_" responded Democratic Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.   Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio praised the ruling on social media.   "Democracy is under attack. President Trump’s unlawful EO to freeze federal funds is an overreach of executive power and a deliberate attack on our nation’s democracy_" she wrote. "A federal judge has already temporarily blocked his efforts_ keeping our checks and balances in place for just a little longer. But make no mistake: this sets a dangerous precedent for our country."  AliKhan was appointed by former President Joe Biden.   Like Blaze News?

285199416,Washington — The top federal prosecutor in South Florida is asking a federal appeals court to toss out the classified documents case against President Trump's former co-defendants_ aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira.Acting U.S. Attorney Hayden O'Byrne made the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Wednesday_ which lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira do not oppose. It's likely the Atlanta-based appeals court will grant the request_ bringing the case initially brought by former special counsel Jack Smith to a close.Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with allegedly helping obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.The prosecution was brought by Smith_ who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort_ Mar-a-Lago_ after leaving the White House four years ago_ and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.Following Mr. Trump's election in November_ Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira.The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win. Should the judges agree to close the case_ a major impediment to the public release of Smith's report summarizing the classified documents investigation would be eliminated. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep the volume of Smith's report that dealt with the case under seal as the appeal progressed. Now_ with the case on the verge of dismissal and Mr. Trump's administration in power_ it remains unclear whether the volume of the report will be released to the public. The first volume of Smith's report_ which involved his investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump stemming from alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election_ was made public just before the president returned to office.Mr. Trump has returned to office with a pledge to end the so-called "weaponization" of the Justice Department. He has since fired roughly a dozen department employees who worked with Smith on the prosecutions of the president.Nauta's lawyer_ Stanley Woodward_ is now serving as a White House lawyer. CBS News previously reported that de Oliveira's attorney_ John Irving_ is under possible consideration for a top job within the Justice Department although a final decision has yet to be made. Irving said in a statement that "Carlos should never have been charged in the first place_ and I have zero doubt that he would have been acquitted at trial. It's nice to see the Justice Department using better judgment these days."
285469610,Marianne Faithfull_ a pioneering artist who transcended “it girl” status in the Sixties for a stunning second act as a singer-songwriter with great depth_ died Thursday at age 78.   “It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer_ songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull_” the singer’s rep said in a statement. “Marianne passed away peacefully in London today_ in the company of her loving family.”  Faithfull became a breakout star in 1964 with her first single_ the ballad “As Tears Go By.” The beloved track would be the first song Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had written together. Although she was only 17 and her voice sounded frail and young_ she sang the lyrics about feeling left out with a conviction that would guide her later work. She continued to score hits throughout the mid Sixties_ before disappearing from the spotlight in a haze of heroin addiction (trials she chronicled in the lyrics to “Sister Morphine_” which the Rolling Stones also recorded).  She reemerged in 1979 with the jaw-dropping Broken English_ an album that drew musically from punk and New Wave and showcased her newfound dark_ sometimes vulgar outlook. Its songs_ like “The Ballad of Lucy Jordan_” “Guilt_” and a cover of John Lennon’s “Working Class Hero_” perfectly fit the way her voice had deepened during her time away. (Faithfull would earn a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.) Over the next 40 years_ she stayed the course_ singing about love and relationships against dramatic_ musical backdrops. In recent years_ she recorded songs by PJ Harvey_ Nick Cave_ Roger Waters_ Leonard Cohen_ and Bob Dylan_ among others. Her most recent album_ Negative Capability_ came out in 2018_ and Rolling Stone lauded it as a “late-career masterwork.”  Thrown into fame at a young age_ controversy overshadowed much of Faithfull’s early career. She was in a relationship with Jagger from 1966 until 1970 and was pilloried by the press after police raided Keith Richards’ flat for drugs and found her nude_ save for a fur bedcover in 1967. Toward the end of the decade_ she was homeless and addicted to heroin. After the death of her son_ she attempted suicide. She eventually cleaned up in the mid-Eighties_ just before redefining herself again with the 1987’s jazzy_ cabaret-influenced Strange Weather_ which featured a new rendition of “As Tears Go By.”  In recent years_ Faithfull battled a number of health setbacks. In addition to a hepatitis-C diagnosis_ she received treatment for breast cancer in 2016_ and underwent shoulder-replacement surgery two years later.  At various points of her career_ she revisited “As Tears Go By” several times_ and marveled in an 2014 interview with Rolling Stone about how profound the song was. “I still sing it every night_” she said. “I still think it’s a beautiful song. I’m still very grateful that Mick and Keith gave it to me and wrote it for me. I suddenly really understood it myself when I was about 40_ when I realized it was another version of [poet Alfred_ Lord Tennyson’s ballad] ‘The Lady of Shalott.’ It hit me during one of my moments of clarity_ which I’ve told you seem to happen periodically. That moment of clarity was when I got clean.”  This story is developing.

U.S. Figure Skating did not confirm the number of its members on board and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Russian state news agencies also reported that three former figure skaters from Russia were on the plane.  The U.S. national championships are held annually in different cities around the country. Leading up to the competition_ skaters must compete in qualifying rounds at regional competitions. U.S. Figure Skating was founded in 1921 and is based in Colorado Springs. It comprises both amateur and professional skating clubs and has almost 900 member clubs.  “We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters_ along with their families_ friends and coaches_ are understood to be among those on board_” the International Skating Union said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy. Figure skating is more than a sport — it’s a close-knit family — and we stand together.”  Tariq Panja contributed reporting.

285252762,ARLINGTON_ Va. — Everyone aboard an American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members that collided with an Army helicopter was feared dead in what was likely to be the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost a quarter century_ officials said Thursday.  At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the midair collision Wednesday night when the helicopter apparently flew in the path of the jet as it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington_ D.C._ officials said.  Crews were still searching for other casualties but did not believe there were any survivors_ which would make it the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years.  ''We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation_'' said John Donnelly_ the fire chief in the nation's capital. ''We don't believe there are any survivors.''  The body of the plane was found upside down in three sections in waist-deep water. The wreckage of the helicopter was also found. Donnelly said first responders on Thursday were searching an area of the Potomac River as far south as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge_ roughly 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the airport.  There was no immediate word on the cause of the collision_ but officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet coming from Wichita_ Kansas_ with U.S. and Russian figure skaters and others aboard_ was making a routine landing when the helicopter flew into its path.  ''On final approach into Reagan National it collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise normal approach_" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said. "At this time we don't know why the military aircraft came into the path of the ... aircraft.''  Three soldiers were onboard the helicopter during a training flight_ an Army official previously said.
285261802,We're following the confirmation hearings for the incoming Trump administration. See our full politics coverage_ and follow NPR's Trump's Terms podcast or sign up for our Politics newsletter to stay up to date.   Who: Kash Patel  Patel is a former public defender_ federal prosecutor and veteran of the first Trump administration. He's also a fierce critic of the Justice Department and the FBI.  Nominated for: director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation_ part of the Justice Department  What this role does: The director oversees the FBI_ which is the United States' premier law enforcement agency_ and the more than 35_000 people who work there. The FBI investigates federal crimes_ everything from terrorism and violent crime to civil rights and public corruption.  Watch Patel's Senate confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee_ set to begin Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET:  In less than a decade_ Kash Patel has risen from a largely unknown congressional aide to become a MAGA-world fixture. He has held senior national security jobs_ sold self-branded merchandise online and written a children's book called The Plot Against the King_ featuring a wizard named Kash and a king named Donald.  Patel is now President Trump's pick to lead the FBI_ the country's premier law enforcement agency_ which is responsible for everything from catching terrorists and spies to investigating cyberattacks and public corruption.  On Thursday_ Patel is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee_ where Democrats are expected to press him about his qualifications to lead the bureau and whether he can — or even wants to — maintain the FBI's traditional independence from the White House.  Those questions are fueled by Patel's fierce loyalty to Trump but also by the long list of Patel's own past statements about rooting out the "deep state" and going after Trump's perceived enemies_ including at the FBI_ at the Justice Department and in the media.  Those comments also dovetail with Trump's own statements during the presidential campaign about seeking vengeance against his opponents.  Republicans_ who hold the majority in the Senate_ have largely been supportive of Patel's nomination_ and he can win confirmation with only GOP support while still losing three Republican votes.  The president and his supporters accuse the FBI and the Justice Department of being weaponized in recent years against conservatives_ and they view Patel as someone who will put the FBI on the correct course.  The Biden Justice Department rejected those allegations_ noting that prosecutors brought cases against President Biden's own son as well as powerful Democratic members of Congress.  Patel's rise   The FBI director's job comes with a 10-year term_ although neither of Patel's immediate predecessors served that full term. Trump fired James Comey in 2017 and replaced him with Christopher Wray.  After Trump's 2024 election win_ he made clear that Wray would not be allowed to stay and nominated Patel to replace him. Wray left before Trump's inauguration.  Patel's résumé is not typical for an FBI director. Wray_ for example_ had run the Criminal Division at the Justice Department_ while Comey had previously served as U.S. attorney in Manhattan and as deputy attorney general_ the No. 2 job in the department.  Patel_ in contrast_ worked as a public defender in Florida before working as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division for a few years.  In 2017_ he moved to the House Intelligence Committee_ where he was a top aide to the top Republican on the panel_ Rep. Devin Nunes of California. It was here that Patel gained attention for helping investigate the investigators who were probing possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  His efforts raised questions about failings in the FBI's work on the probe_ and it made Patel a hero among Trump supporters. It also helped him land a job on Trump's National Security Council and later as a top aide to the director of national intelligence and to the secretary of defense.  Toward the end of the first Trump administration_ the president tried to install Patel in top positions at the CIA and the FBI but backed down in the face of opposition from senior leaders at the Justice Department_ Congress and elsewhere.  After Trump's 2020 election loss_ Patel became a frequent guest on right-wing podcasts.  It is in those podcast episodes that Patel has made many of his controversial statements. He has railed against what he calls the deep state_ which he views as people in senior national security roles who he claims have weaponized the justice system and intelligence agencies and pose a threat to democracy.  In one appearance on Shawn Ryan's podcast_ Patel vowed to shut down the FBI headquarters in Washington_ D.C._ "on Day 1 and reopening the next day as a museum of the deep state."  "And I'd take the 7_000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals_" he added. "Go be cops. You're cops— go be cops. Go chase down murderers and rapists and drug dealers and violent offenders."  He also wrote a book called Government Gangsters that includes a list of deep state actors whom Patel's critics have described as an enemies list.  All of this sets up what could be a tense confirmation hearing.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal_ a Democrat from Connecticut and a Senate Judiciary Committee member_ called Patel "unqualified and unprepared" to lead the FBI.  "Anybody who has an enemies list that would be targets for retribution_ anyone who wants to shut down the FBI here in Washington_ anyone who wants to purge an agency that has to investigate impartially and objectively_ is unfit for this job_" Blumenthal said.  Blumenthal said he met with Patel ahead of the hearing and pressed him on his statements about using the FBI as a political weapon. He said Patel responded with "totally unpersuasive assurances."  "What he offered in these vague assurances — was 'Oh_ I would never do anything like that' — but he has said he would do exactly that_ so he's going to have to explain himself_" Blumenthal said.  Republicans_ meanwhile_ appear to have largely swung behind Patel's nomination.  Sen. John Cornyn_ R-Texas_ who has met with Patel as well to discuss his potential confirmation_ acknowledged that for some people_ some of Patel's past statements could be controversial.  "Obviously_ Kash was engaging in a lot of political rhetoric_ and I think he understands the difference between that and actually doing the job at the DOJ and the FBI_" Cornyn said. "And I think the FBI needs a course correction_ and he's certainly capable of doing that."
285464592,Microsoft has announced that Forza Horizon 5 is crossing the console divide from Xbox Series X to PS5.  In a news release_ Microsoft pegged Forza Horizon 5 for release on PS5 "this spring" but didn't nail down a specific release date. The racing game will arrive on PS5 with all of the same content and DLC as the Xbox and PC version_ and cross-play has been confirmed.  In addition_ there's a new update called Horizon Realms coming to all platforms that "will give players the chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds_ alongside some other surprises."  Released in 2021_ Forza Horizon 5 brings all the thrills of racing to an open-world format based in Mexico and adds new modes such as hide-and-seek. We were pretty keen on it upon release and gave it a perfect score in our Forza Horizon 5 review.  "Forza Horizon 5 is a stunning and beautifully crafted entry in the series that's full of memorable races_ creativity_ and fantastic additions_" we said_ also calling it "Playground Games' most exciting and beautifully crafted entry yet." No pressure for Fable 4 or anything like that_ then.  Over the past 12 months_ Microsoft has softened its stance on Xbox exclusives_ with various older games like Hi-Fi Rush and Grounded jumping to consoles like the PS5_ Nintendo Switch_ and so on. Even newer games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have been released with less exclusivity in mind_ though PlayStation fans are still waiting on that one.  Speaking in a recent interview_ Xbox boss Phil Spencer explained that "there is no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game" when asked about Starfield's future platform plans.  "Our strategy is to allow our games to be available_" he said "Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform_ but to keep games off of other platforms_ that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."  We're still waiting for Starfield to cross the console divide_ but Forza Horizon 5? No longer.

285276876,By DAVID KLEPPER_ Associated Press  WASHINGTON (AP) — Tulsi Gabbard_ President Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence_ is expected to face tough questions from lawmakers Thursday over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria’s now-deposed leader.  The back-and-forth during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee could reveal whether she has successfully assuaged concerns from lawmakers of both parties — or whether worries about her experience and background will sink her nomination to oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.  Gabbard_ a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii_ is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who deployed twice to the Middle East and ran for president in 2020. She has no formal intelligence experience_ however_ and has never run a government agency or department.  It’s Gabbard’s comments_ however_ that have posed the biggest challenge to her confirmation. Gabbard has repeatedly echoed Russian propaganda used to justify the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a corrupt autocrat.  She’s been accused of spreading Russian disinformation by Republican lawmakers and has even won praise in Russian state-controlled media.  A 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad is another point of contention. Assad was recently deposed as his country’s leader following a brutal civil war in which he was accused of using chemical weapons. Following her visit_ Gabbard faced criticism that she was legitimizing a dictator and then more questions when she said she was skeptical that Assad had used chemical weapons.  As a lawmaker_ Gabbard sponsored legislation that would have repealed a key surveillance program known as Section 702_ which allows authorities to collect the communications of suspected terrorists overseas.  Gabbard said the program could be violating the rights of Americans whose communications are swept up inadvertently_ but national security officials say the program has saved lives.  She now says she supports the program_ noting new safeguards designed to protect Americans’ privacy.  While lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about Gabbard’s nomination_ Republicans have increasingly come to support her. Given thin Republican margins in the Senate_ she will need almost all GOP senators to vote yes in order to win confirmation.  Sen. Tom Cotton_ chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee_ said that while he understands there are questions about Gabbard’s past views_ questions about her loyalty to the U.S. are inappropriate.  “She’s passed five different background checks. I reviewed the latest one. It’s clean as a whistle_” the Arkansas Republican said on “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences. I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard’s patriotism or her integrity.”
285282446,KHAN YOUNIS_ Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants freed eight hostages on Thursday in the latest release since a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took hold earlier this month. Israel was expected to release another 110 Palestinian prisoners.  The release was delayed by a chaotic scene in which a crowd of Palestinians surrounded and jeered at hostages as they were turned over to the Red Cross.  The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas_ whose Oct. 7_ 2023_ attack into Israel sparked the fighting. It has held despite a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages were released.  The first hostage_ female Israeli soldier Agam Berger_ was released in northern Gaza. Hours later_ a chaotic scene unfolded as thousands of people pressed around a handover site in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis_ in front of the destroyed home of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.  Footage showed Arbel Yehoud_ a 29-year-old hostage_ looking stunned as she was led through the crowd by militants toward waiting Red Cross vehicles.  Hundreds of militants from Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group arrived with a convoy in a show of force_ and thousands of people gathered to watch_ some from the tilted rooftops of bombed-out buildings. Many in the crowd shouted and surrounded Yehoud as masked militants pushed people away and escorted her through.  Red Cross vehicles were then delayed as they tried to drive away. The Israeli army later announced the Red Cross had confirmed it had the freed hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the “shocking” scene” and called on international mediators to prevent similar events in the future.  Hamas had earlier handed Berger_ 20_ to the Red Cross after parading her in front of a crowd in the heavily destroyed urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza. The Israeli government later release footage of Berger hugging and crying with her parents.  Berger was among five young_ female soldiers abducted in the Oct. 7 attack. The other four were released on Saturday.  People cheered_ clapped and whistled at a square in Tel Aviv where supporters of the hostages watched Berger’s handover on big screens next to a large clock that’s counted the days the hostages have been in captivity. Some held signs saying: “Agam we’re waiting for you at home.”  The other two Israelis released Thursday are Yehoud and Gadi Moses_ an 80-year-old man. Five Thai nationals were freed_ but were not been officially identified.  A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas’ attack. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight Thais remain in captivity_ two of whom are believed to be dead.  Of the people set to be released from prisons in Israel_ 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Zakaria Zubeidi_ a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later_ is also among those set to be released.  Israel said Yehoud was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not.  The United States_ Egypt and Qatar_ which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations_ resolved the dispute with an agreement that Yehoud would be released Thursday. Another three hostages_ all men_ are set to be freed Saturday along with dozens more Palestinian prisoners.  On Monday_ Israel began allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza_ the most heavily destroyed part of the territory_ and hundreds of thousands streamed back. Many found only mounds of rubble where their homes had been.  Ceasefire holds for now but next phase will be harder  In the first phase of the ceasefire_ Hamas is set to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages_ including women_ children_ older adults and sick or wounded men_ in exchange for nearly 2_000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead.  Palestinians have cheered the release of the prisoners_ who they widely see as heroes who have sacrificed for the cause of ending Israel’s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state.  Israeli forces have meanwhile pulled back from most of Gaza_ allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance.  The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.  Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas_ even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase.  Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.  Tens of thousands killed  Hamas started the war when it sent thousands of fighters storming into Israel. The militants killed some 1_200 people_ mostly civilians_ and abducted around 250.  Israel’s ensuing air and ground war among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. More than 47_000 Palestinians have been killed_ over half of them women and children_ according to Gaza’s Health Ministry_ which does not say how many of the dead were militants.  The Israeli military says it killed over 17_000 fighters_ without providing evidence_ and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense residential neighborhoods and put military infrastructure near homes_ schools and mosques.  The Israeli offensive has transformed entire neighborhoods into mounds of gray rubble_ and it’s unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt. Around 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced_ often multiple times_ with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps or shuttered schools.
